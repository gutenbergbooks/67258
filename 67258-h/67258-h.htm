  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The chief occasion for this edition is the change in the first-year
curriculum in Harvard Law School, which assigned to other courses
many things formerly appropriated to the course in the Law of Torts
and hence treated in former editions. Thus causation is now treated
in a course on the Principles of Legal Liability; certain excuses, such as
consent and self-defence, are dealt with in that course, and trespass to
land and conversion, which analytically might well be treated in the
first chapter of this book, have been thought more appropriate to the
course on the Law of Property. But the student should be warned that
such matters of arrangement do not inhere in the law. They are mere
matters of pedagogical expediency. He should bear in mind that the
law is a unit and should be on his guard against thinking of it as made
up of separate water-tight compartments. General principles which
are of prime importance in connection with the subjects treated in this
book are dealt with primarily in the courses on Property and on
Criminal Law. Not the least important task for the student is to seek
constantly for these relations between the subjects studied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, the student should be warned that the arrangement proceeds
upon pedagogical considerations and does not seek to set forth an analytical
system. System is to be derived from study of the cases. The
effort of the student to make one in connection with his summaries for
review and his reading of the systematic discussions referred to in the
notes will do more for him than learning in advance a system laid out
by some one else. Similar reasons have led to omission of subheadings
as far as consistent with convenience, leaving it to the student to
systematize the main headings for himself. For other purposes an
index is offered instead.</p>

<p class='c007'>In arrangement of the cases advantage has been taken of the experience
of the late Dean Thayer, who had given the matter anxious consideration
for some years. Indeed the instinct of Dean Ames for
teachable cases, the sagacity of Judge Smith in finding significant
cases, and the judgment of Dean Thayer in matters of arrangement
left little of moment for the present editor to do.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Action of assault, battery, and wounding.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> The evidence to prove
a provocation was, that the plaintiff put his hand upon his sword and
said, “If it were not assize-time, I would not take such language from
you.” The question was, if that were an assault? The court agreed
that it was not; for the declaration of the plaintiff was that he would
not assault him, the judges being in town; and the intention as well
as the act makes an assault.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Therefore, if one strike another upon the
hand or arm or breast, in discourse, it is no assault, there being no
intention to assault; but if one, intending to assault, strike at another
and miss him, this is an assault: so if he hold up his hand against
another in a threatening manner and say nothing, it is an assault. In
the principal case the plaintiff had judgment.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>STEPHENS <em>v.</em> MYERS<br /> <span class='sc'>At Nisi Prius, coram Tindal, C. J., July 17, 1830.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 4 Carrington &amp; Payne, 349.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Assault. The declaration stated that the defendant threatened
and attempted to assault the plaintiff. Plea: Not guilty.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appeared that the plaintiff was acting as chairman at a parish
meeting, and sat at the head of a table, at which table the defendant
also sat, there being about six or seven persons between him and the
plaintiff. The defendant having, in the course of some angry discussion
which took place, been very vociferous, and interrupted the proceedings
of the meeting, a motion was made that he should be turned
out, which was carried by a very large majority. Upon this the
defendant said he would rather pull the chairman out of the chair
than be turned out of the room, and immediately advanced with his
fist clenched toward the chairman, but was stopped by the churchwarden,
who sat next but one to the chairman, at a time when he was
not near enough for any blow he might have meditated to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>reached the chairman, but the witnesses said that it seemed to them
that he was advancing with an intention to strike the chairman.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Spankie</em>, Serjt., for the defendant, upon this evidence, contended
that no assault had been committed, as there was no power in the
defendant, from the situation of the parties, to execute his threat,—there
was not a present ability,—he had not the means of executing
his intention at the time he was stopped.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tindal, C. J.</span>, in his summing up, said: It is not every threat, when
there is no actual personal violence, that constitutes an assault; there
must, in all cases, be the means of carrying the threat into effect. The
question I shall leave to you will be, whether the defendant was advancing
at the time, in a threatening attitude, to strike the chairman,
so that his blow would almost immediately have reached the chairman
if he had not been stopped; then, though he was not near enough at
the time to have struck him, yet, if he was advancing with that intent,
I think it amounts to an assault in law. If he was so advancing that,
within a second or two of time, he would have reached the plaintiff, it
seems to me it is an assault in law. If you think he was not advancing
to strike the plaintiff, then only can you find your verdict for the
defendant; otherwise you must find it for the plaintiff, and give him
such damages as you think the nature of the case requires.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>READ <em>v.</em> COKER<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Common Pleas, June 1, 1853.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 13 Common Bench Reports, 850.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Assault and false imprisonment.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> The first count charged an
assault committed by the defendant on the plaintiff on the 24th of
March, 1853, by thrusting him out of a certain workshop.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plea: Not guilty “by statute,” upon which issue was joined.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cause was tried before Talfourd, J., at the first sitting in London
in Easter term last. The facts which appeared in evidence were as
follows: The plaintiff was a paper-stainer, carrying on business in the
City Road, upon premises which he rented of one Molineux, at a rent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of 8<em>s.</em> per week. In January, 1852, the rent being sixteen weeks in
arrear, the landlord employed one Holliwell to distrain for it. Holliwell
accordingly seized certain presses, lathes, and other trade fixtures,
and, at the plaintiff’s request, advanced him £16 upon the security of
the goods, for the purpose of paying off the rent. The plaintiff, being
unable to redeem his goods, on the 23d of February applied to the
defendant for assistance. The goods were thereupon sold to the defendant
by Holliwell, on the part of Read, for £25 11<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>; and it was
agreed between the plaintiff and the defendant that the business
should be carried on for their mutual benefit, the defendant paying the
rent of the premises and other outgoings, and allowing the plaintiff a
certain sum weekly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant, becoming dissatisfied with the speculation, dismissed
the plaintiff on the 22d of March. On the 24th, the plaintiff
came to the premises, and, refusing to leave when ordered by the defendant,
the latter collected together some of his workmen, who
mustered round the plaintiff, tucking up their sleeves and aprons, and
threatened to break his neck if he did not go out; and, fearing that the
men would strike him if he did not do so, the plaintiff went out. This
was the assault complained of in the first count. Upon this evidence
the learned judge left it to the jury to say whether there was an intention
on the part of the defendant to assault the plaintiff, and
whether the plaintiff was apprehensive of personal violence if he did
not retire. The jury found for the plaintiff on this count. Damages,
one farthing.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Byles</em>, Serjt., on a former day in this term, moved for a rule <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi</span></i> for
a new trial, on the ground of misdirection, and that the verdict was
not warranted by the evidence. That which was proved as to the
first count clearly did not amount to an assault. [<span class='sc'>Jervis, C. J.</span> It
was as much an assault as a sheriff’s officer being in a room with a
man against whom he has a writ, and saying to him, “You are my
prisoner,” is an arrest.] To constitute an assault, there must be
something more than a threat of violence. An assault is thus defined
in Buller’s Nisi Prius, p. 15: “An assault is an attempt or offer,
by force or violence, to do a corporal hurt to another, as by pointing
a pitchfork at him, when standing within reach; presenting a gun at
him [within shooting distance]; drawing a sword, and waving it in a
menacing manner, &amp;c. The Queen <em>v.</em> Ingram, 1 Salk. 384. But no
words can amount to an assault, though perhaps they may in some
cases serve to explain a doubtful action: 1 Hawk. P. C. 133; as if a
man were to lay his hand upon his sword, and say, ‘If it were not
assize-time, he would not take such language,’—the words would
prevent the action from being construed to be an assault, because they
show he had no intent to do him any corporal hurt at that time:
Tuberville <em>v.</em> Savage.” So, in Selwyn’s Nisi Prius (11th ed.), 26, it is
said: “An assault is an attempt, with force or violence, to do a corporal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>injury to another, as by holding up a fist in a menacing manner;
striking at another with a cane or stick, though the party striking may
miss his aim; drawing a sword or bayonet; throwing a bottle or glass
with intent to wound or strike; presenting a gun at a person who is
within the distance to which the gun will carry; pointing a pitchfork
at a person who is within reach (Genner <em>v.</em> Sparks); or by any other
similar act, accompanied with such circumstances as denote at the
time an intention, coupled with a present ability (see Stephens <em>v.</em>
Myers), of using actual violence against the person of another.” So,
in 3 Bl. Comm. 120, an assault is said to be “an attempt or offer to
beat another, without touching him; as if one lifts up his cane or his
fist in a threatening manner at another, or strikes at him but misses
him: this is an assault, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">insultus</span></i>, which Finch (L. 202) describes to be
‘an unlawful setting upon one’s person.’” [<span class='sc'>Jervis, C. J.</span> If a man
comes into a room, and lays his cane on the table, and says to another,
“If you don’t go out I will knock you on the head,” would not that be
an assault?] Clearly not: it is a mere threat, unaccompanied by any
gesture or action towards carrying it into effect. The direction of the
learned judge as to this point was erroneous. He should have told the
jury that to constitute an assault there must be an attempt, coupled
with a present ability, to do personal violence to the party; instead of
leaving it to them, as he did, to say what the plaintiff thought, and not
what they (the jury) thought was the defendant’s intention. There
must be some act done denoting a present ability and an intention
to assault.</p>

<p class='c007'>A rule <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi</span></i> having been granted,</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Allen</em>, Serjt., and <em>Charnock</em> now showed cause. The first question
is, whether the evidence was sufficient, as to the first count, to justify
the learned judge in putting it to the jury whether or not the defendant
had been guilty of an assault. The evidence was, that the plaintiff
was surrounded by the defendant and his men, who, with their sleeves
and aprons tucked up, threatened to break his neck if he did not quit
the workshop. [<span class='sc'>Maule, J.</span> If there can be such a thing as an assault
without an actual beating, this is an assault.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Jervis, C. J.</span> I am of opinion that this rule cannot be made absolute
to its full extent; but that, so far as regards the first count of the
declaration, it must be discharged. If anything short of actual striking
will in law constitute an assault, the facts here clearly showed
that the defendant was guilty of an assault. There was a threat of
violence exhibiting an intention to assault, and a present ability to
carry the threat into execution.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Indictment for an assault upon one Susan Shelton.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evidence was that the defendant came into the house where
Mrs. Shelton was sitting at a window. He was armed with a musket
and a club; and raising the club over her head, in an attitude for
striking, and within striking distance, said to her that if she said a
word (or if she opened her mouth) he would strike her; and this
without any provocation on her part.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Mr. Bradley</em> and <em>Mr. Hoban</em>, for the defendant, contended that
this was not, in law, an assault; that there can be no assault without
a present intent to strike; and his saying, “if she opened her mouth,”
showed that he had not such a present intent; and they cited the old
case, “if it were not the assizes, I would stab you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the <span class='sc'>Court</span> (<span class='sc'>Thurston, J.</span>, absent) said that he had no right
to restrain her from speaking; and his language showed an intent to
strike upon her violation of a condition which he had no right to impose.
Suppose a stranger comes to my house armed, and raises his
club over my head, within striking distance, and threatens to beat me
unless I will go out of and abandon my house; surely that would be an
assault. So, if a highwayman puts a pistol to my breast, and threatens
to shoot me unless I give him my money; this would be evidence of an
assault, and would be charged as such in the indictment.</p>

<p class='c014'>Trespass and assault. Pleas: Not guilty, and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">son assault demesne</span></i>.
Issue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiffs were owners of a field in which the defendants were
walking with loaded guns at half-cock in their hands. The plaintiffs
desired them to withdraw and give their names, and on their refusal
advanced towards them, apparently as if to apprehend them. The
defendants half raised their guns, which they pointed towards them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>and threatened to shoot them. The plaintiffs (one of whom was a
constable) then gave them in charge to a policeman for shooting with
intent, and he, with their assistance, seized and handcuffed them.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>E. James</em> submitted that there was no assault; as the guns were
only at half-cock, there was no “present ability” to execute the
threat. Read <em>v.</em> Coker.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed per</span></i> <span class='sc'>Willes, J.</span> Pointing a loaded gun at a person is in law
an assault. It is immaterial that it is at half-cock; cocking it is an
instantaneous act, and there is a “present ability” of doing the act
threatened, for it can be done in an instant.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><em>E. James.</em> The assault was in self-defence; the defendants were
only trespassers, and there was an attempt to apprehend them, and
excess is not even assigned. Broughton <em>v.</em> Jackson, 18 Q. B. 378.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Willes, J.</span> It was not necessary that it should be. To shoot a man
is not a lawful way of repelling an assault. No doubt the charge of
shooting with intent was idle, and the assault was only a misdemeanor.

<p class='c014'>Trespass, for an assault.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the general issue it appeared that, the plaintiff and defendant
being engaged in an angry altercation, the defendant stepped into his
office, which was at hand, and brought out a gun, which he aimed at
the plaintiff in an excited and threatening manner, the plaintiff being
three or four rods distant. The evidence tended to show that the
defendant snapped the gun twice at the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff
did not know whether the gun was loaded or not, and that, in fact, the
gun was not loaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court ruled that the pointing of a gun, in an angry and threatening
manner, at a person three or four rods distant, who was ignorant
whether the gun was loaded or not, was an assault, though it
should appear that the gun was not loaded, and that it made no
difference whether the gun was snapped or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court, among other things, instructed the jury that, in assessing
the damages, it was their right and duty to consider the effect
which the finding of light or trivial damages in actions for breaches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>of the peace would have to encourage a disregard of the laws and
disturbances of the public peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant excepted to these rulings and instructions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury having found a verdict for the plaintiff, the defendant
moved for a new trial by reason of said exceptions.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Morrison</em> and <em>Fitch</em>, for the defendant. The first question arising
in this case is, Is it an assault to point an unloaded gun at a person
in a threatening manner? An assault is defined to be an inchoate
violence to the person of another, with the present means of carrying
the intent into effect. 2 Greenl. Ev. 72. The attempt or offer with
violence to do corporal hurt to another must be coupled with a present
ability to constitute an assault. Roscoe’s Crim. Ev. 287; 1 Russell
on Crimes, 750. It is no assault to point an unloaded gun or pistol at
another, &amp;c. Blake <em>v.</em> Barnard, 9 Car. &amp; P. 626; Regina <em>v.</em> Baker, 1
Car. &amp; K. 254; Regina <em>v.</em> James, 1 Car. &amp; K. 530. The court erred in
instructing the jury that the pointing of a gun in an angry and threatening
manner was an assault. It is well settled that the intention to
do harm is the essence of an assault, and this intent is to be collected
by the jury from the circumstances of the case. 2 Greenl. Ev. 73.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Gilchrist, C. J.</span> Several cases have been cited by the counsel of
the defendant to show that the ruling of the court was incorrect.
Among them is the case of Regina <em>v.</em> Baker, 1 Car. &amp; K. 254. In that
case, the prisoner was indicted under the statute of 7 Will. IV. and
1 Vict. c. 85, for attempting to discharge a loaded pistol. Rolfe, B.,
told the jury that they must consider whether the pistol was in such
a state of loading that, under ordinary circumstances, it would have
gone off, and that the statute under which the prisoner was indicted
would then apply. He says, also, “If presenting a pistol at a person,
and pulling the trigger of it, be an assault at all, certainly, in the
case where the pistol was loaded, it must be taken to be an attempt
to discharge the pistol with intent to do some bodily injury.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From the manner in which this statement is made, the opinion of
the court must be inferred to be, that presenting a loaded pistol is an
assault. There is nothing in the case favorable to the defendant. The
statute referred to relates to loaded arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case of Regina <em>v.</em> James, 1 Car. &amp; K. 530, was an indictment
for attempting to discharge a loaded rifle. It was shown that the
priming was so damp that it would not go off. Tindal, C. J., said:
“I am of opinion that this was not a loaded arm within the statute
of 1 Vict. c. 85, and that the prisoner can neither be convicted of the
felony nor of the assault. It is only an assault to point a loaded pistol
at any one, and this rifle is proved not to be so loaded as to be able to
be discharged.” The reason why the prisoner could not be convicted
of the assault is given in the case of Regina <em>v.</em> St. George, 9 Car. &amp; P.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>483, where it was held that on an indictment for a felony, which
includes an assault, the prisoner ought not to be convicted of an
assault, which is quite distinct from the felony charged, and on such
an indictment the prisoner ought only to be convicted of an assault,
which is involved in the felony itself. In this case, Parke, B., said:
“If a person presents a pistol which has the appearance of being
loaded, and puts the party into fear and alarm, that is what it is the
object of the law to prevent.” So if a person present a pistol purporting
to be a loaded pistol at another, and so near as to have been dangerous
to life if the pistol had gone off; <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">semble</span></i>, that this is an assault,
even though the pistol were, in fact, not loaded. Ibid.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of Blake <em>v.</em> Barnard, 9 Car. &amp; P. 626, which was trespass
for an assault and false imprisonment, the declaration alleged that
the pistol was loaded with gunpowder, ball, and shot, and it was held
that it was incumbent on the plaintiff to make that out. Lord
Abinger then says, “If the pistol was not loaded, it would be no
assault,” and the prisoner would be entitled to an acquittal, which
was undoubtedly correct, under that declaration, for the variance.
Regina <em>v.</em> Oxford, 9 Car. &amp; P. 525.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most important objects to be attained by the enactment
of laws and the institutions of civilized society is, each of us shall feel
secure against unlawful assaults. Without such security society loses
most of its value. Peace and order and domestic happiness, inexpressibly
more precious than mere forms of government, cannot be enjoyed
without the sense of perfect security. We have a right to live
in society without being put in fear of personal harm. But it must be
a reasonable fear of which we complain. And it surely is not unreasonable
for a person to entertain a fear of personal injury, when a pistol
is pointed at him in a threatening manner, when, for aught he knows,
it may be loaded, and may occasion his immediate death. The business
of the world could not be carried on with comfort, if such things
could be done with impunity.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think the defendant guilty of an assault, and we perceive no
reason for taking any exception to the remarks of the court. Finding
trivial damages for breaches of the peace—damages incommensurate
with the injury sustained—would certainly lead the ill-disposed to
consider an assault as a thing that might be committed with impunity.
But at all events, it was proper for the jury to consider
whether such a result would or would not be produced. Flanders <em>v.</em>
Colby, 28 N. H. 34.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the defendant
alleged exceptions, and also filed motions to set aside the verdict as
being against law and the weight of evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Appleton, C. J.</span> There is in the declaration a count for an assault
and battery upon the female plaintiff. In reference to this branch
of the case, the following instructions were given: “Was there a
trespass committed upon the female plaintiff? She is the only one
who seeks for damages. Whatever may have been the injury inflicted
upon the other inmates of that house, she can recover on this suit only
for that which was inflicted upon her. In order to constitute an
assault, it is not necessary that the person should be touched, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>there should be certain indignities. In the language of one of the
decisions, if the plaintiff was embarrassed and distressed by the acts
of the defendant, it would amount in law to an assault.” The acts
and indignities which from the charge might constitute an assault
were the bursting open a door, which the defendants had no right to
fasten, and the inconveniences resulting from taking off the doors and
taking out the windows, which made it uncomfortable for the female
plaintiff to remain, where remaining, she was a trespasser. So the
bringing a bloodhound by the defendant into his house, which is
proved to have barked, but not to have bitten, and the making a noise
therein, with other similar acts, it was contended, would amount to an
assault and trespass, and of that the jury were to judge. Now, such
is not the law. An assault and battery is clearly defined by R. S., c.
118, § 28, thus: “Whoever unlawfully attempts to strike, hit, touch,
or do any violence to another, however small, in a wanton, wilful,
angry, or insulting manner, having an intention and existing ability
to do some violence to such person, shall be deemed guilty of an
assault; and if such attempt is carried into effect, he shall be deemed
guilty of an assault and battery.” Now, the removal of a door or
windows, of the owner in possession, would constitute no assault.
Indeed, as has been seen, 6 Allen, 76, the owner would, in attempting
it, have the right to use as much force as was necessary to overcome
the resistance of the unlawfully resisting and trespassing tenant. Acts
which may embarrass and distress do not necessarily amount to an
assault. Indignities may not constitute an assault. Acts aggravating
an assault differ materially from the assault thereby aggravated.
Insulting language or conduct may aggravate an assault, but it, not an
assault.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a> So the acts of the defendant in taking out the windows of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>his own house, in a bleak and cold day, might distress one unlawfully
occupying and illegally refusing to quit his premises, but they could in
no sense be regarded as an assault upon her. One may be embarrassed
and distressed by acts done “in a wanton, wilful, angry, or insulting
manner,” where there is no “intention nor existing ability to do some
violence” to the person, and yet there be no assault. The instruction
on this point is equally at variance with the common law and
the statute of the State.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>First, That the least touching of another in anger<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> is a battery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thirdly, If any of them use violence against the other, to force his

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Assault.</span> Plea:<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Not guilty.</p>

<p class='c007'>It further appeared that the plaintiff, on the 30th of November,
1843, went to a dinner of the society at Radley’s Hotel, and was
prevented by a policeman named Douglas from entering the room;
and it was proved by the policeman that he acted by order of the
defendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the alleged assault, the policeman said, “The
plaintiff tried to push by me into the room, and I prevented him;”
but some of the other witnesses stated that the plaintiff tried to enter
the room, and was pushed back.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Erle</em> addressed the jury for the defendant. There is no assault
here. The policeman, who must best know what was done, says that
the plaintiff tried to push into the room, and he prevented him; and
preventing a person from pushing into a room is no assault, the
assault, if any, being rather on the other side.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Denman, C. J.</span> (in summing up). You will say, whether, on
the evidence, you think that the policeman committed an assault on
the plaintiff, or was merely passive. If the policeman was entirely
passive, like a door or a wall put to prevent the plaintiff from entering
the room, and simply obstructing the entrance of the plaintiff, no
assault has been committed on the plaintiff, and your verdict will be
for the defendant. The question is, Did the policeman take any
active measures to prevent the plaintiff from entering the room, or
did he stand in the doorway passive, and not move at all?</p>

<p class='c014'>Declaration: That the defendant assaulted and beat the plaintiff,
gave him in custody to a policeman, and caused him to be imprisoned
in a police-station for twenty-four hours, and afterwards to be taken
in custody along public streets before metropolitan police magistrates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pleas: First, Not guilty; third, That the plaintiff, within the Metropolitan
Police District, assaulted the defendant, and therefore the
defendant gave the plaintiff into custody to a police officer, who had
view of the assault, in order that he might be taken before magistrates
and dealt with according to law, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Whereupon issue was joined.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial before Bramwell, B., at the London sittings in last
Hilary term, the plaintiff proved that, on the night of the 31st of
October, he was passing through High Street, Islington, and stopped
to look at a house which was on fire. The defendant was directing a
stream of water from the hose of an engine on the fire. The plaintiff
said, “Don’t you see you are spreading the flames? Why don’t you
pump on the next house?” He went away, and then came back and
repeated these words several times, but did not touch the defendant.
The defendant charged the plaintiff with assaulting him, and gave
him into the custody of a policeman who was standing near.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant swore that, on being interrupted by the plaintiff,
he told him to get out of the way and mind his own business; that the
plaintiff came up to him again, seized him by the shoulder, violently
turned him round, exposed him to danger, and turned the water off
the fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned judge told the jury that the question was whether an
assault and battery had been committed; and he asked them, first,
whether the plaintiff laid hands on the defendant; and, secondly,
whether he did so hostilely. The jury found that the plaintiff did lay
hands on the defendant, intending to attract his attention. Whereupon
the learned judge ordered the verdict to be entered for the
plaintiff, reserving leave to the defendant to move to enter a verdict
for him if the court should be of opinion that he had wrongly directed
the jury in telling them that, to find the issue on the third plea for
the defendant, they must find that the plaintiff laid his hands upon
him with a hostile intention.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Shee</em>, Serjt., in the same term, having obtained a rule <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi</span></i> accordingly.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Beasley</em> now showed cause. The question is, whether the intention
of the plaintiff is material to be considered in order to determine
whether there was an assault and battery. In Rawlings <em>v.</em> Till, 3
M. &amp; W. 28, Parke, B., referring to Wiffin <em>v.</em> Kincard, 2 B. &amp; P. N. R.
471, where it was held that a touch given by a constable’s staff does
not constitute a battery, pointed out, as the ground of that decision,
that there the touch was merely to engage the plaintiff’s attention.
[<span class='sc'>Martin, B.</span> Suppose two persons were walking near each other,
and one turned round, and in so doing struck the other: surely that
would not be a battery. <span class='sc'>Pollock, C. B.</span> There may be a distinction
for civil and criminal purposes. <span class='sc'>Channell, B.</span> It was necessary to
prove an indictable assault and battery in order to sustain the plea.]
The maxim, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea</span></i> applies. He referred
also to Pursell <em>v.</em> Horn, 8 A. &amp; E. 602; Archbold’s Criminal Law,
p. 524 (12th ed.); Scott <em>v.</em> Shepherd, 2 W. Bl. 892.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Petersdorff</em>, Serjt., and <em>Francis</em>, in support of the rule. The learned
judge’s direction was defective in introducing the word “hostile.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>In order to constitute an assault, it is enough if the act be done against
the will of the party. There are several cases where it has been held
that an assault has been committed where there was no intention to
do the act complained of in a hostile way, as in the case of a prizefight.
Rex <em>v.</em> Perkins, 4 Car. &amp; P. 537. So a surgeon assisting a
female patient to remove a portion of her dress. Rex <em>v.</em> Rosinski
1 Moody C. C. 19. Here the plaintiff interfered with the defendant
in the execution of his duty. In Hawkins’ Pleas of the Crown, vol. i.
p. 263, it is said, “Any injury whatever, be it never so small, being
actually done to the person of a man in an angry, or revengeful, or
rude, or insolent manner, as by spitting in his face, or any way touching
him in anger, or violently jostling him out of the way, are batteries
in the eye of the law.” [<span class='sc'>Bramwell, B.</span> I think that the jostling
spoken of must mean a voluntary jostling.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pollock, C. B.</span> I am of opinion that the rule must be discharged.
The jury found that what the plaintiff did was done with the intent
to attract the attention of the defendant, not with violence to justify
giving the plaintiff into custody for an assault. The defendant
treated it as a criminal act, and gave the plaintiff into custody. We
are called on to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff, on the ground that
he touched the defendant.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a> There is no foundation for the application.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Martin, B.</span> I am of the same opinion. The assault and battery
which the defendant was bound to establish means such an assault as
would justify the putting in force the criminal law for the purpose of
bringing the plaintiff to justice. It is necessary to show some act
which justified the interference of the police officer. Touching a
person so as merely to call his attention, whether the subject of a civil
action or not, is not the ground of criminal proceeding. It is clear
that it is no battery within the definition given by Hawkins.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Channell, B.</span> I am of the same opinion. Looking at the plea, it
is obvious that it was not proved.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bramwell, B.</span>, concurred.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>DE MARENTILLE <em>v.</em> OLIVER<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New Jersey, February Term, 1808.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 1 Pennington, 379.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>This was action of trespass, brought by the defendant in this court,
against the plaintiff <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in certiorari</span></i>. The state of demand charged the
defendant below, that he unlawfully, forcibly, and with great violence,
with a large stick, struck the horse of the plaintiff, on the public
highway, which said horse was then before a carriage, in which the
plaintiff was riding, on the said public highway, to the damage of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>plaintiff fifty dollars. This cause was tried by a jury, and verdict and
judgment for the plaintiff, $15 damages. It was assigned for error
that the suit was brought before the justice to recover damages for an
assault and battery, when, by law, such an action cannot be supported
before a justice of the peace.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pennington, J.</span><a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a> To attack and strike with a club, with violence,
the horse before a carriage, in which a person is riding, strikes me as
an assault on the person;<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a> and if so, the justice had no jurisdiction of
the action.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if this is to be considered as a trespass on the property, unconnected
with an assault on the person, I think that it was incumbent
on the plaintiff below to state an injury done to the horse, whereby
the plaintiff suffered damage; that he was in consequence of the blow
bruised or wounded, and unable to perform service; or that the plaintiff
had been put to expense in curing of him, or the like. All the precedents
of declarations for injuries done to domestic animals, as far as
my recollection goes, are in that way; and I think, with good reason.
Suppose a man, seeing a stranger’s horse in the street, was to strike
him with a whip, or a large stick, if you please, and no injury was to
ensue, could the owner of the horse maintain an action for this act?
I apprehend not. For these reasons, I incline to think, that this
judgment ought to be reversed.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Davis, J.</span><a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Under the common law of England as it has been recognized
and administered in this country, a woman cannot maintain
against her seducer an action for damages arising from her own
seduction. This is frankly admitted by the counsel for the plaintiff in
error; but they ask a reversal of the judgment below upon the ground
that the plaintiff was induced to consent to the solicitations of the
defendant by a betrayal of the love and confidence which had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>engendered in her by a period of courtship and by a promise of marriage
made by him. Confessedly this is not an action <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex contractu</span></i>
upon a promise of marriage, in which the seduction might be pleaded
and proved as an aggravation of damages;<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a> but it is clearly an attempt
to recover <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex delicto</span></i>. There is no averment of mutual promises
or of an agreement to marry; and an analysis of the amended petition
discloses no more than that the defendant’s promise was one of the
blandishments by which he accomplished his purpose. The case,
therefore, presents no exception to the common law rule; for there is
no claim of fraud, violence or artifice other than mere solicitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The theory of the common law is that, since adultery and fornication
are crimes,<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> the woman is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">particeps criminis</span></i> and hence that she
cannot be heard to complain of a wrong which she helped to produce.
It may be conceded that some of the arguments adduced here might
be fairly persuasive if addressed to the legislature. Indeed in several
of the states statutes have been enacted authorizing such an action;
but a careful study of the decisions in those states, limiting and construing
those statutes, raises a doubt whether the legislation is a real
advance upon the common law. 8 Ann. Cas. 1115, note. There is,
however, no such statute in this state and the common law rule
applies.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Nash, C. J.</span> This case presents the question whether, when two
men fight together, thereby committing an affray, either is guilty of
an assault and battery upon the other. Justice Buller, in his Nisi
Prius, at page 16, says, each does commit an assault and battery upon
the other, and that each can maintain an action for it. He refers to a
case at Abingdon, Boulter <em>v.</em> Clark, when Serjeant Hayward appeared
for the defendant, and offered to prove that the parties fought by consent
and insisted that this, under the maxim <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">volenti non fit injuria</span></i>,
applied. Parker, Chief Baron, denied it, and said, “the fighting being
unlawful, the consent of the plaintiff to fight would be no bar to his
action, and that he was entitled to a verdict.” Mr. Stephens, in his
Nisi Prius, 211, lays down the same doctrine: “If two men engage in
a boxing match, an action can be sustained by either of them against
the other, if an assault be made; because the act of boxing is unlawful,
and the consent of the parties to fight cannot excuse the injury.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Trespass and false imprisonment. Pleas: Not guilty; and leave
and license.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was proved by a member of the plaintiff’s family that he was a
flannel draper in Castle Street, Holborn, and that on the 3d of April
he came home accompanied by the defendants, Cleaton and Lane;
and that the plaintiff said Cleaton had arrested him at Mr. Sanders’s,
in Holborn; that the plaintiff’s wife asked the defendant Lane, who
was, in fact, clerk to Cleaton’s attorney, if he had any authority, and
he said he had; and being asked his name, said, “My name is Selby
of Chancery Lane.” Lane made several inquiries about the plaintiff’s
property, and said he would give him time till eight o’clock in the
evening; upon which the other defendant, Cleaton, said, “How can
you do that? I will not allow you to give him any time at all.” It
was proved that, in fact, Mr. Selby had no bailable process against the
plaintiff. A witness was also called, who proved that, in conversation
with the defendant Lane on the subject, he said it was a foolish piece
of business; that Mr. Cleaton had caused him to do it; that he was
very sorry for it, but he thought Mr. Cleaton would indemnify him.
There was some uncertainty in the evidence of the conversation
whether the defendant Lane admitted or not that he had taken the
plaintiff by the arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to the evidence of Mr. Sanders, at whose house the transaction
commenced, the plaintiff was bargaining with him for the sale
of some goods, and had just made out the invoice, which was lying
before him, when the defendant Cleaton came in alone, and asked the
plaintiff several times to pay the amount he owed him, or some money
on account. The plaintiff said he would not; upon which Cleaton
went just outside the door, and returned immediately, followed by
the defendant Lane, and pointing to the plaintiff, said, “This is the
gentleman.” The plaintiff tore up the invoice he had written, and
threw it on the fire, and said, “I suppose I am to go with you.” The
answer given was, “Yes.” The plaintiff and the two defendants went
away together.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Talfourd</em>, Serjt., for the defendant. No arrest has been proved.
Sanders, who was present, says nothing of the laying hold of the
plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tindal, C. J.</span> The question is, whether the plaintiff went voluntarily
from Mr. Sanders’s to his own house, or whether he went in
consequence of the acts of the defendants. If you put your hand upon
a man, or tell him he must go with you, and he goes, supposing you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>have the power to enforce him, is not that an arrest? May you not
arrest without touching a man?</p>

<p class='c007'><em>White</em> referred to the case of Arrowsmith <em>v.</em> Le Mesurier, 2 B. &amp;
P. N. R. 211.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tindal, C. J.</span> That is a case which has often been spoken of as
going to the very extreme point; but in that case the jury found that
the plaintiff went voluntarily with the officer. And in this case, if you
can persuade the jury that the plaintiff went voluntarily, you may
succeed.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Talfourd</em>, Serjt., then addressed the jury for the defendants. There
was no real compulsion. No writ was produced. It was only an
endeavor by a manœuvre to make the plaintiff do what he ought, but
would not, viz., pay the money which he owed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tindal, C. J.</span>, in summing up, told the jury, that, if the plaintiff
was acting as an unwilling agent, at the time and against his own will
when he went to his own house from that of Sanders, it was just as
much an arrest as if the defendants had forced him along.</p>

Madbury for the year 1836; that they assessed a list of taxes upon the
inhabitants of said town, among whom was the plaintiff, and committed
it to Nathan Brown, collector of said town, for collection.
Brown, after having given due notice to the plaintiff, being in a room
with her, called upon her to pay the tax, which she declined doing until
arrested. He then told her that he arrested her, but did not lay his
hand upon her; and thereupon she paid the tax.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this evidence the defendants objected that the action could
not be maintained, because there was no assault.</p>

<p class='c007'>It did not appear that the defendants had been sworn, as directed
by the statute of January 4, 1833. A verdict was taken for the
plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span><span class='sc'>Wilcox, J.</span><a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a>&#160;... But it is contended that in the present case
there has been no assault committed, and no false imprisonment.
Bare words will not make an arrest: there must be an actual touching
of the body; or, what is tantamount, a power of taking immediate
possession of the body, and the party’s submission thereto. Genner
<em>v.</em> Sparkes, 1 Salk. 79. Where a bailiff, having a writ against a person,
met him on horseback, and said to him, “You are my prisoner,” upon
which he turned back and submitted, this was held to be a good arrest,
though the bailiff never laid hand on him. But if, on the bailiff’s
saying those words, he had fled, it had been no arrest, unless the bailiff
had laid hold of him. Homer <em>v.</em> Battyn, Buffer’s N. P. 62. The same
doctrine is held in other cases. Russen <em>v.</em> Lucas &amp; al., 1 Car. &amp; P. 153;
Chinn <em>v.</em> Morris, 2 Car. &amp; P. 361; Pocock <em>v.</em> Moore, Ry. &amp; M. 321;
Strout <em>v.</em> Gooch, 8 Greenl. 126; Gold <em>v.</em> Bissell, 1 Wend. 210.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where, upon a magistrate’s warrant being shown to the plaintiff,
the latter voluntarily and without compulsion attended the constable
who had the warrant to the magistrate, it was held there was no sufficient
imprisonment to support an action. Arrowsmith <em>v.</em> Le Mesurier,
2 B. &amp; P. N. R. 211. But in this case there was no declaration
of any arrest, and the warrant was in fact used only as a summons.
And if the decision cannot be sustained upon this distinction, it must
be regarded as of doubtful authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>Starkie says that in ordinary practice words are sufficient to constitute
an imprisonment, if they impose a restraint upon the person, and
the plaintiff is accordingly restrained; for he is not obliged to incur
the risk of personal violence and insult by resisting, until actual violence
be used. 3 Stark. Ev. 1113. This principle is reasonable in
itself, and is fully sustained by the authorities above cited. Nor does
it seem necessary that there should be any very formal declaration of
an arrest. If the officer goes for the purpose of executing his warrant;
has the party in his presence and power; if the party so understands
it, and in consequence thereof submits, and the officer, in execution of
the warrant, takes the party before a magistrate, or receives money or
property in discharge of his person, we think it is in law an arrest,
although he did not touch any part of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case at bar, it clearly appears that the plaintiff did not intend
to pay the tax, unless compelled by an arrest of her person. The
collector was so informed. He then proceeded to enforce the collection
of the tax,—declared that he arrested her,—and she, under that restraint,
paid the money. This is a sufficient arrest and imprisonment
to sustain the action, and there must, therefore, be</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Thayer, J.</span><a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a> With reference to the motion for a new trial which has
been filed in this case and duly considered, it will suffice to say, that I
entertain no doubt that the jury were warranted in finding that plaintiff
was unlawfully restrained of his liberty from about the 27th or
28th of October until the 10th of November following; that is to say,
for a period of about two weeks. The testimony in the case clearly
showed that during that period he was constantly guarded by detectives
employed by defendant for that purpose; that he was at no time
free to come and go as he pleased; that his movements were at all
times subject to the control and direction of those who had him in
charge; that he was urged by them on several occasions to confess his
guilt, and make known his confederates; and that he was subjected
to repeated examinations and cross-examinations touching the robbery,
of such character as clearly to imply that he was regarded as a
criminal, and that force would be used to detain him if he attempted
to assert his liberty. The jury in all probability found (as they were
warranted in doing) that during the time plaintiff remained in company
with the detectives, he was in fact deprived of all real freedom of
action, and that whatever consent he gave to such restraint was an
enforced consent, and did not justify the detention without a warrant.
It is manifest that the court ought not to disturb the finding on that
issue.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In this vacation (9th July), there being a difference of opinion on
the bench, the learned judges who heard the argument delivered
judgment <em>seriatim</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Coleridge, J.</span> In this case, in which we have unfortunately been
unable to agree in our judgment, I am now to pronounce the opinion
which I have formed; and I shall be able to do so very briefly, because,
having had the opportunity of reading a judgment prepared by
my Brother Patteson, and entirely agreeing with it, I may content
myself with referring to the statement he has made in detail of those
preliminary points in which we all, I believe, agree, and which bring
the case up to that point upon which its decision must certainly turn,
and with regard to which our difference exists.</p>

<p class='c007'>This point is, whether certain facts, which may be taken as clear
upon the evidence, amount to an imprisonment. These facts, stated
shortly, and as I understand them, are in effect as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>A part of a public highway was inclosed, and appropriated for spectators
of a boat-race, paying a price for their seats. The plaintiff was
desirous of entering this part, and was opposed by the defendant; but,
after a struggle, during which no momentary detention of his person
took place, he succeeded in climbing over the inclosure. Two policemen
were then stationed by the defendant to prevent, and they did
prevent, him from passing onwards in the direction in which he declared
his wish to go; but he was allowed to remain unmolested where
he was, and was at liberty to go, and was told that he was so, in the
only other direction by which he could pass. This he refused for
some time, and during that time remained where he had thus placed
himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are the facts; and, setting aside those which do not properly
bear on the question now at issue, there will remain these: that the
plaintiff, being in a public highway and desirous of passing along it
in a particular direction, is prevented from doing so by the orders of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the defendant, and that the defendant’s agents for the purpose are
policemen, from whom, indeed, no unnecessary violence was to be
anticipated, or such as they believed unlawful, yet who might be expected
to execute such commands as they deemed lawful with all
necessary force, however resisted. But although thus obstructed, the
plaintiff was at liberty to move his person and go in any other direction,
at his free will and pleasure; and no actual force or restraint on
his person was used, unless the obstruction before mentioned amounts
to so much.</p>

<p class='c007'>I lay out of consideration the question of right or wrong between
these parties. The acts will amount to imprisonment, neither more
nor less, from their being wrongful or capable of justification.</p>

<p class='c007'>And I am of opinion that there was no imprisonment. To call it so
appears to me to confound partial obstruction and disturbance with
total obstruction and detention. A prison may have its boundary
large or narrow, visible and tangible, or, though real, still in the conception
only; it may itself be movable or fixed; but a boundary it
must have, and that boundary the party imprisoned must be prevented
from passing; he must be prevented from leaving that place,
within the ambit of which the party imprisoning would confine him,
except by prison breach. Some confusion seems to me to arise from
confounding imprisonment of the body with mere loss of freedom: it
is one part of the definition of freedom to be able to go whithersoever
one pleases; but imprisonment is something more than the mere loss
of this power: it includes the notion of restraint within some limits
defined by a will or power exterior to our own.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Com. Dig. Imprisonment (G), it is said: “Every restraint of the
liberty of a free man will be an imprisonment.” For this the authorities
cited are 2 Inst. 482; Cro. Car. 209. But when these are referred
to, it will be seen that nothing was intended at all inconsistent with
what I have ventured to lay down above. In both books the object
was to point out that a prison was not necessarily what is commonly
so called, a place locally defined and appointed for the reception of
prisoners. Lord Coke is commenting on the statute of Westminster
2d,<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a> <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in prisona</span></i>, and says: “Every restraint of the liberty of a freeman
is an imprisonment, although he be not within the walls of any common
prison.” The passage in Cro. Car. 209, is from a curious case of
an information against Sir Miles Hobert and Mr. Stroud for escaping
out of the Gate-house Prison, to which they had been committed by
the king. The question was whether, under the circumstances, they
had ever been there imprisoned. Owing to the sickness in London,
and through the favor of the keeper, these gentlemen had not, except
on one occasion, ever been within the walls of the Gate-house. The
occasion is somewhat singularly expressed in the decision of the court,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>which was “that their voluntary retirement to the close stool” in the
Gate-house “made them to be prisoners.” The resolution, however,
in question is this: “that the prison of the King’s Bench is not any
local prison confined only to one place, and that every place where any
person is restrained of his liberty is a prison; as if one take sanctuary
and depart thence, he shall be said to break prison.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On a case of this sort, which, if there be difficulty in it, is at least
purely elementary, it is not easy nor necessary to enlarge, and I am
unwilling to put any extreme case hypothetically; but I wish to meet
one suggestion, which has been put as avoiding one of the difficulties
which cases of this sort might seem to suggest. If it be said that to
hold the present case to amount to an imprisonment would turn every
obstruction of the exercise of a right of way into an imprisonment, the
answer is that there must be something like personal menace or force
accompanying the act of obstruction, and that, with this, it will
amount to imprisonment. I apprehend that is not so. If, in the
course of a night, both ends of a street were walled up, and there was
no egress from the house but into the street, I should have no difficulty
in saying that the inhabitants were thereby imprisoned; but if only
one end were walled up, and an armed force stationed outside to prevent
any scaling of the wall or passage that way, I should feel equally
clear that there was no imprisonment. If there were, the street would
obviously be the prison, and yet, as obviously, none would be confined
to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Knowing that my lord has entertained strongly an opinion directly
contrary to this, I am under serious apprehension that I overlook
some difficulty in forming my own; but, if it exists, I have not been
able to discover it, and am therefore bound to state that, according to
my view of the case, the rule should be absolute for a new trial.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Denman, C. J.</span> I have not drawn up a formal judgment in
this case, because I hoped to the last that the arguments which my
learned brothers would produce in support of their opinion might alter
mine. We have freely discussed the matter both orally and in written
communications; but, after hearing what they have advanced, I am
compelled to say that my first impression remains. If, as I must
believe, it is a wrong one, it may be in some measure accounted for by
the circumstances attending the case. A company unlawfully obstructed
a public way for their own profit, extorting money from passengers,
and hiring policemen to effect this purpose. The plaintiff,
wishing to exercise his right of way, is stopped by force, and ordered
to move in a direction which he wished not to take. He is told at the
same time that a force is at hand ready to compel his submission.
That proceeding appears to me equivalent to being pulled by the
collar out of the one line and into the other.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>There is some difficulty, perhaps, in defining imprisonment in the
abstract without reference to its illegality; nor is it necessary for me
to do so, because I consider these acts as amounting to imprisonment.
That word I understand to mean any restraint of the person by force.
In Buller’s Nisi Prius, p. 22, it is said: “Every restraint of a man’s
liberty under the custody of another, either in a gaol, house, stocks,
or in the street, is in law an imprisonment; and whenever it is done
without a proper authority, is false imprisonment, for which the law
gives an action; and this is commonly joined to assault and battery;
for every imprisonment includes a battery, and every battery an
assault.” It appears, therefore, that the technical language has received
a very large construction, and that there need not be any touching
of the person: a locking up would constitute an imprisonment,
without touching. From the language of Thorpe, C. J., which Mr.
Selwyn cites from the Book of Assizes, it appears that, even in very
early times, restraint of liberty by force was understood to be the
reasonable definition of imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had no idea that any person in these times supposed any particular
boundary to be necessary to constitute imprisonment, or that the
restraint of a man’s person from doing what he desires ceases to be
an imprisonment because he may find some means of escape.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said that the party here was at liberty to go in another direction.
I am not sure that in fact he was, because the same unlawful
power which prevented him from taking one course might, in case of
acquiescence, have refused him any other. But this liberty to do
something else does not appear to me to affect the question of imprisonment.
As long as I am prevented from doing what I have a
right to do, of what importance is it that I am permitted to do something
else? How does the imposition of an unlawful condition show
that I am not restrained? If I am locked in a room, am I not imprisoned,
because I might effect my escape through a window, or
because I might find an exit dangerous or inconvenient to myself, as
by wading through water, or by taking a route so circuitous that my
necessary affairs should suffer by delay?</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears to me that this is a total deprivation of liberty with
reference to the purpose for which he lawfully wished to employ his
liberty; and, being effected by force, it is not the mere obstruction of
a way, but a restraint of the person. The case cited as occurring
before Lord Chief Justice Tindal, as I understand it, is much in point.
He held it an imprisonment where the defendant stopped the plaintiff
on his road till he had read a libel to him. Yet he did not prevent his
escaping in another direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said that if any damage arises from such obstruction, a special
action on the case may be brought. Must I then sue out a new writ
stating that the defendant employed direct force to prevent my going
where my business called me, whereby I sustained loss? And if I do,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>is it certain that I shall not be told that I have misconceived my
remedy, for all flows from the false imprisonment, and that should
have been the subject of an action of trespass and assault? For the
jury properly found that the whole of the defendant’s conduct was
continuous: it commenced in illegality; and the plaintiff did right to
resist it as an outrageous violation of the liberty of the subject from
the very first.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>WEAVER <em>v.</em> WARD<br /> <span class='sc'>In the King’s Bench, Easter Term, 1616.</span><br /> <em>Reported in Hobart, 134.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Weaver brought an action of trespass of assault and battery against
Ward. The defendant pleaded that he was, amongst others, by the
commandment of the lords of the council, a trained soldier in London,
of the band of one Andrews, captain, and so was the plaintiff:
and that they were skirmishing with their muskets charged with
powder for their exercise <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in re militari</span></i> against another captain and
his band; and as they were so skirmishing, the defendant, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">casualiter
et per infortunium et contra voluntatem suam</span></i>, in discharging his piece,
did hurt and wound the plaintiff; which is the same, &amp;c., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">absque hoc</span></i>,
that he was guilty <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliter sive alio modo</span></i>. And, upon demurrer by the
plaintiff, judgment was given for him; for, though it were agreed that
if men tilt or tourney in the presence of the king, or if two masters of
defence playing their prizes kill one another, that this shall be no
felony, or if a lunatic kill a man, or the like; because felony must be
done <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">animo felonico</span></i>; yet, in trespass, which tends only to give damages
according to hurt or loss, it is not so; and therefore, if a lunatic
hurt a man, he shall be answerable in trespass,<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a> and, therefore, no man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>shall be excused of a trespass (for this is the nature of an excuse, and
not of a justification, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prout ei bene licuit</span></i>), except it may be judged
utterly without his fault; as if a man by force take my hand and strike
you, or if here the defendant had said that the plaintiff ran across his
piece when it was discharging, or had set forth the case with the circumstances
so as it had appeared to the court that it had been inevitable,
and that the defendant had committed no negligence to give
occasion to the hurt.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'>BROWN <em>v.</em> KENDALL<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, October Term, 1850.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 6 Cushing, 292.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>This was an action of trespass for assault and battery, originally
commenced against George K. Kendall, the defendant, who died
pending the suit, and his executrix was summoned in.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appeared in evidence, on the trial, which was before Wells, C. J.,
in the Court of Common Pleas, that two dogs, belonging to the plaintiff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and the defendant, respectively, were fighting in the presence of
their masters; that the defendant took a stick about four feet long,
and commenced beating the dogs in order to separate them; that the
plaintiff was looking on, at the distance of about a rod, and that he
advanced a step or two towards the dogs. In their struggle, the dogs
approached the place where the plaintiff was standing. The defendant
retreated backwards from before the dogs, striking them as he
retreated; and as he approached the plaintiff, with his back towards
him, in raising his stick over his shoulder, in order to strike the dogs,
he accidentally hit the plaintiff in the eye, inflicting upon him a
severe injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether it was necessary or proper for the defendant to interfere
in the fight between the dogs; whether the interference, if called for
was in a proper manner, and what degree of care was exercised by each
party on the occasion; were the subject of controversy between the
parties, upon all the evidence in the case, of which the foregoing is an
outline.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant requested the judge to instruct the jury, that “if
both the plaintiff and defendant at the time of the blow were using
ordinary care, or if at that time the defendant was using ordinary care
and the plaintiff was not, or if at that time both plaintiff and defendant
were not using ordinary care, then the plaintiff could not recover.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant further requested the judge to instruct the jury,
that, “under the circumstances, if the plaintiff was using ordinary
care and the defendant was not, the plaintiff could not recover, and
that the burden of proof on all these propositions was on the plaintiff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge declined to give the instructions, as above requested, but
left the case to the jury under the following instructions: “If the defendant,
in beating the dogs, was doing a necessary act, or one which
it was his duty under the circumstances of the case to do, and was
doing it in a proper way; then he was not responsible in this action,
provided he was using ordinary care at the time of the blow. If it
was not a necessary act; if he was not in duty bound to attempt to
part the dogs, but might with propriety interfere or not as he chose;
the defendant was responsible for the consequences of the blow, unless
it appeared that he was in the exercise of extraordinary care, so that
the accident was inevitable, using the word inevitable not in a strict
but a popular sense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If, however, the plaintiff, when he met with the injury, was not
in the exercise of ordinary care, he cannot recover, and this rule applies,
whether the interference of the defendant in the fight of the dogs
was necessary or not. If the jury believe, that it was the duty of the
defendant to interfere, then the burden of proving negligence on the
part of the defendant, and ordinary care on the part of the plaintiff,
is on the plaintiff. If the jury believe, that the act of interference in
the fight was unnecessary, then the burden of proving extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>care on the part of the defendant, or want of ordinary care on the part
of the plaintiff, is on defendant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury under these instructions returned a verdict for the plaintiff;
whereupon the defendant alleged exceptions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Shaw, C. J.</span> This is an action of trespass, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi et armis</span></i>, brought by
George Brown against George K. Kendall, for an assault and battery;
and the original defendant having died pending the action, his executrix
has been summoned in. The rule of the common law, by which
this action would abate by the death of either party, is reversed in this
Commonwealth by statute, which provides that actions of trespass for
assault and battery shall survive. Rev. Sts. c. 93, § 7.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts set forth in the bill of exceptions preclude the supposition,
that the blow, inflicted by the hand of the defendant upon the person
of the plaintiff, was intentional. The whole case proceeds on the assumption,
that the damage sustained by the plaintiff, from the stick
held by the defendant, was inadvertent and unintentional; and the
case involves the question how far, and under what qualifications, the
party by whose unconscious act the damage was done is responsible
for it. We use the term “unintentional” rather than involuntary,
because in some of the cases, it is stated, that the act of holding and
using a weapon or instrument, the movement of which is the immediate
cause of hurt to another, is a voluntary act, although its particular
effect in hitting and hurting another is not within the purpose or
intention of the party doing the act.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears to us, that some of the confusion in the cases on this subject
has grown out of the long-vexed question, under the rule of the
common law, whether a party’s remedy, where he has one, should be
sought in an action of the case, or of trespass. This is very distinguishable
from the question, whether in a given case, any action will
lie. The result of these cases is, that if the damage complained of is
the immediate effect of the act of the defendant, trespass <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi et armis</span></i>
lies; if consequential only, and not immediate, case is the proper
remedy. Leame <em>v.</em> Bray, 3 East, 593; Huggett <em>v.</em> Montgomery, 2 B. &amp;
P. N. R. 446, Day’s Ed., and notes.</p>

<p class='c007'>In these discussions, it is frequently stated by judges, that when one
receives injury from the direct act of another, trespass will lie. But
we think this is said in reference to the question, whether trespass and
not case will lie, assuming that the facts are such, that some action
will lie. These <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</span></i> are no authority, we think, for holding, that
damage received by a direct act of force from another will be sufficient
to maintain an action of trespass, whether the act was lawful or unlawful,
and neither wilful, intentional, or careless. In the principal case
cited, Leame <em>v.</em> Bray, the damage arose from the act of the defendant,
in driving on the wrong side of the road, in a dark night, which was
clearly negligent, if not unlawful. In the course of the argument of
that case (p. 595), Lawrence, J., said: “There certainly are cases in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the books, where, the injury being direct and immediate, trespass has
been holden to lie, though the injury was not intentional.” The term
“injury” implies something more than damage; but, independently
of that consideration, the proposition may be true, because though the
injury was unintentional, the act may have been unlawful or negligent,
and the cases cited by him are perfectly consistent with that supposition.
So the same learned judge in the same case says (p. 597), “No
doubt trespass lies against one who drives a carriage against another,
whether done wilfully or not.” But he immediately adds, “Suppose
one who is driving a carriage is negligently and heedlessly looking
about him, without attending to the road when persons are passing,
and thereby runs over a child and kills him, is it not manslaughter?
and if so, it must be trespass; for every manslaughter includes trespass;”
showing what he understood by a case not wilful.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think, as the result of all the authorities, the rule is correctly
stated by Mr. Greenleaf, that the plaintiff must come prepared with
evidence to show either that the <em>intention</em> was unlawful, or that the
defendant was <em>in fault</em>; for if the injury was unavoidable, and the conduct
of the defendant was free from blame, he will not be liable. 2
Greenl. Ev. §§ 85–92. Wakeman <em>v.</em> Robinson, 1 Bing. 213. If, in the
prosecution of a lawful act, a casualty purely accidental arises, no
action can be supported for an injury arising therefrom. Davis <em>v.</em>
Saunders, 2 Chit. R. 639; Com. Dig. Battery, A. (Day’s Ed.) and
notes; Vincent <em>v.</em> Stinehour, 7 Vt. 62. In applying these rules to the
present case, we can perceive no reason why the instructions asked for
by the defendant ought not to have been given; to this effect, that if
both plaintiff and defendant at the time of the blow were using ordinary
care, or if at that time the defendant was using ordinary care, and
the plaintiff was not, or if at that time, both the plaintiff and defendant
were not using ordinary care, then the plaintiff could not recover.</p>

<p class='c007'>In using this term, ordinary care, it may be proper to state, that
what constitutes ordinary care will vary with the circumstances of
cases. In general, it means that kind and degree of care, which prudent
and cautious men would use, such as is required by the exigency
of the case, and such as is necessary to guard against probable danger.
A man, who should have occasion to discharge a gun, on an open and
extensive marsh, or in a forest, would be required to use less circumspection
and care, than if he were to do the same thing in an inhabited
town, village, or city. To make an accident, or casualty, or, as the law
sometimes states it, inevitable accident, it must be such an accident
as the defendant could not have avoided by the use of the kind and
degree of care necessary to the exigency, and in the circumstances in
which he was placed.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are not aware of any circumstances in this case, requiring a distinction
between acts which it was lawful and proper to do, and acts
of legal duty. There are cases, undoubtedly, in which officers are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>bound to act under process, for the legality of which they are not responsible,
and perhaps some others in which this distinction would be
important. We can have no doubt that the act of the defendant in
attempting to part the fighting dogs, one of which was his own, and
for the injurious acts of which he might be responsible, was a lawful
and proper act, which he might do by proper and safe means. If,
then, in doing this act, using due care and all proper precautions necessary
to the exigency of the case, to avoid hurt to others, in raising his
stick for that purpose, he accidentally hit the plaintiff in his eye, and
wounded him, this was the result of pure accident, or was involuntary
and unavoidable, and therefore the action would not lie. Of if the
defendant was chargeable with some negligence, and if the plaintiff
was also chargeable with negligence, we think the plaintiff cannot
recover without showing that the damage was caused wholly by the
act of the defendant, and that the plaintiff’s own negligence did not
contribute as an efficient cause to produce it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court instructed the jury, that if it was not a necessary act, and
the defendant was not in duty bound to part the dogs, but might with
propriety interfere or not as he chose, the defendant was responsible
for the consequences of the blow, unless it appeared that he was in the
exercise of extraordinary care, so that the accident was inevitable,
using the word not in a strict but a popular sense. This is to be taken
in connection with the charge afterwards given, that if the jury believed,
that the act of interference in the fight was unnecessary (that
is, as before explained, not a duty incumbent on the defendant), then
the burden of proving extraordinary care on the part of the defendant,
or want of ordinary care on the part of plaintiff, was on the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court are of opinion that these directions were not conformable
to law. If the act of hitting the plaintiff was unintentional, on the
part of the defendant, and done in the doing of a lawful act, then the
defendant was not liable, unless it was done in the want of exercise of
due care, adapted to the exigency of the case, and therefore such want
of due care became part of the plaintiff’s case, and the burden of proof
was on the plaintiff to establish it. 2 Greenl. Ev. § 85; Powers <em>v.</em>
Russell, 13 Pick. 69, 76; Tourtellot <em>v.</em> Rosebrook, 11 Met. 460.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the learned judge, by the use of the term extraordinary
care, in the above charge, explained as it is by the context, may have
intended nothing more than that increased degree of care and diligence,
which the exigency of particular circumstances might require,
and which men of ordinary care and prudence would use under like
circumstances, to guard against danger. If such was the meaning of
this part of the charge, then it does not differ from our views, as above
explained. But we are of opinion, that the other part of the charge,
that the burden of proof was on the defendant, was incorrect. Those
facts which are essential to enable the plaintiff to recover, he takes the
burden of proving. The evidence may be offered by the plaintiff or by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the defendant; the question of due care, or want of care, may be essentially
connected with the main facts, and arise from the same proof;
but the effect of the rule, as to the burden of proof, is this, that when
the proof is all in, and before the jury, from whatever side it comes,
and whether directly proved, or inferred from circumstances, if it
appears that the defendant was doing a lawful act, and unintentionally
hit and hurt the plaintiff, then unless it also appears to the satisfaction
of the jury, that the defendant is chargeable with some fault, negligence,
carelessness, or want of prudence, the plaintiff fails to sustain
the burden of proof, and is not entitled to recover.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>STANLEY <em>v.</em> POWELL<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Queen’s Bench Division, November 3, 1890.</span><br /> <em>Reported in [1891] 1 Queen’s Bench, 86.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Denman, J.</span> This case was tried before me and a special jury at the
last Maidstone Summer Assizes.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the statement of claim the plaintiff alleged that the defendant
had <em>negligently and wrongfully and unskilfully</em> fired his gun and
wounded the plaintiff in his eye, and that the plaintiff, in consequence,
had lost his sight and suffered other damage. The defendant denied
the negligence alleged. After the evidence on both sides, which was
conflicting, had been heard, I left the three following questions to the
jury: 1. Was the plaintiff injured by a shot from defendant’s gun?
2. Was the defendant guilty of negligence in firing the charge to which
that shot belonged as he did? 3. Damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The undisputed facts were, that on Nov. 29, 1888, the defendant
and several others were pheasant shooting in a party, some being
inside and some outside of a wood which the beaters were beating.
The right of shooting was in one Greenwood, who was of the party.
The plaintiff was employed by Greenwood to carry cartridges and the
game which might be shot. Several beaters were driving the game
along a plantation of saplings towards an open drive. The plaintiff
stood just outside a gate which led into a field outside the plantation,
at the end of the drive. The defendant was walking along in that field
a few yards from the hedge which bounded the plantation. As he was
walking along a pheasant rose inside the plantation; the defendant
fired one barrel at this bird, and, according to the evidence for the
defendant, struck it with his first shot. There was a considerable conflict
of evidence as to details; but the jury must, I think, be taken to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>have adopted the version of the facts sworn to by the defendant’s
witnesses. They swore that the bird, when struck by the first shot,
began to lower and turn back towards the beaters, whereupon the
defendant fired his second barrel and killed the bird, but that a shot,
glancing from the bough of an oak which was in or close to the hedge,
and, striking the plaintiff, must have caused the injury complained of.
The oak in question, according to the defendant’s evidence, was partly
between the defendant and the bird when the second barrel was fired,
but it was not in a line with the plaintiff, but, on the contrary, so
much out of that line, that the shot must have been diverted to a considerable
extent from the direction in which the gun must have been
pointed in order to hit the plaintiff. The distance between the plaintiff
and the defendant, in a direct line, when the second barrel was fired,
was about thirty yards. The case for the plaintiff was entirely different;
but I think it must be held that the jury took the defendant’s
account of the matter, for they found the second question left to them
in the negative. Before summing up the case to the jury, I called the
attention of the parties to the doctrine which seemed to have been laid
down in some old cases—that, even in the absence of negligence, an
action of trespass might lie; and it was agreed that I should leave the
question of negligence to the jury, but that, if necessary, the pleadings
were deemed to have been amended so as to raise any case or defence
open upon the facts with liberty to the court to draw inferences of
fact, and that the damages should be assessed contingently. The
jury assessed them at £100. I left either party to move the court
for judgment; but it was afterwards agreed that the case should be
argued before myself on further consideration, and that I should give
judgment, notwithstanding that I had left the parties to move the
court, as though I had originally reserved it for further consideration
before myself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having heard the arguments, I am of opinion that, by no amendment
that could be made consistently with the finding of the jury
could I properly give judgment for the plaintiff. It was contended
on his behalf that this was a case in which an action of trespass would
have lain before the Judicature Acts; and this contention was mainly
founded on certain <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</span></i> which, until considered with reference to
those cases in which they are uttered, seem to support that contention;
but no decision was quoted, nor do I think that any can be
found which goes so far as to hold, that if A. is injured by a shot from
a gun fired at a bird by B., an action of trespass will necessarily lie,
even though B. is proved to have fired the gun without negligence and
without intending to injure the plaintiff or to shoot in his direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury having found that there was no negligence on the part of
the defendant, the most favorable way in which it is now possible to
put the case for the plaintiff is to consider the action as brought for a
trespass, and to consider that the defendant has put upon the record
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>a defence denying negligence, and specifically alleging the facts, sworn
to by his witnesses, which the jury must be considered to have found
proved, and then to consider whether those facts, coupled with the
absence of negligence established by the jury, amount to an excuse
in law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earliest case relied upon by the plaintiff was one in the year-book
21 Hen. 7, 28 A., which is referred to by Grose, J., in the course
of the argument in Leame <em>v.</em> Bray, 3 East, 593, to be mentioned presently,
in these words: “There is a case put in the year-book, 21 Hen.
7, 28 A., that where one shot an arrow at a mark which glanced from
it and struck another, it was holden to be trespass.” Returning to
the case in the year-book, it appears that the passage in question was
a mere <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictum</span></i> of Rede, who (see 5 Foss’ Lives of the Judges, p. 230)
was at the time (1506) either a judge of the King’s Bench or C. J. of
the Common Pleas, which he became in October in that year, in a
case of a very different kind from that in question, and it only amounts
to a statement that an action of trespass may lie even where the act
done by the defendant is <em>unintentional</em>. The words relied on are,
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mes ou on tire a les buts et blesse un home, coment que est incontre sa
volonte, il sera dit un trespassor incontre son entent.</span></i>” But in that very
passage Rede makes observations which show that he has in his mind
cases in which that which would be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> a trespass may be
excused. The next case in order of date relied upon for the plaintiff
was Weaver <em>v.</em> Ward, decided in 1607. There is no doubt that that
case contains <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</span></i> which <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i> would be in favor of the plaintiff, but
it also contains the following summing up of the law applicable to
cases of unintentional injury by acts which are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> trespasses:
“Therefore, no man shall be excused of a trespass&#160;... except it may
be judged utterly without his fault,” showing clearly that there may
be such cases. That case, after all, only decided that where the plaintiff
and defendant were skirmishing as soldiers of the train-band, and
the one, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">casualiter, et per infortunium, et contra voluntatem suam</span></i>”
(which must be translated “accidentally and involuntarily”) shot
the other, an action of trespass would lie, <em>unless</em> he could show that
such involuntary and accidental shooting was done under such circumstances
as utterly to negative negligence. Such cases may easily
be supposed, in which there could be no two opinions about the matter;
but other cases may, as the present case did, involve considerable
conflicts of evidence and opinion which until recently a jury only could
dispose of. The case of Gibbons <em>v.</em> Pepper, 4 Mod. 405, decided in
1695, merely decided that a plea merely showing that an accident
caused by a runaway horse was <em>inevitable</em>, was a bad plea in an action
of trespass, because, if <em>inevitable</em>, that was a defence under the general
issue. It was a mere decision on the pleading, and laid down nothing
as regards the point raised in the present case. The concluding words
of the judgment, which show clearly the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ratio decidendi</span></i> of that case,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>are these: “He should have pleaded the general issue, for if the horse
ran away against his will he would have been found <em>not guilty</em>, because
in such a case it cannot be said with any color of reason to be a battery
in the rider.” The more modern cases of Wakeman <em>v.</em> Robinson and
Hall <em>v.</em> Fearnley, lay down the same rule as regards the pleading
point, though the former case may also be relied upon as an authority
by way of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictum</span></i> in favor of the plaintiff, and the latter may be fairly
relied upon by the defendant; for Wightman, J., in his judgment
explains Wakeman <em>v.</em> Robinson thus: “The act of the defendant”
(viz., driving the cart at the very edge of a narrow pavement on which
the plaintiff was walking, so as to knock the plaintiff down) “was
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> unjustifiable, and required an excuse to be shown. When
the motion in this case was first made, I had in my recollection the
case of Wakeman <em>v.</em> Robinson. It was there agreed that an <em>involuntary</em>
act might be a defence on the general issue. The decision indeed
turned on a different point; but the general proposition is laid down.
I think the <em>omission to plead</em> the defence here deprived the defendant
of the benefit of it, and entitled the plaintiff to recover.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But in truth neither case decides whether, where an act such as discharging
a gun is voluntary, but the result injurious without negligence,
an action of trespass can nevertheless be supported as against
a plea pleaded and proved, and which the jury find established, to the
effect that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case of Underwood <em>v.</em> Hewson, 1 Str. 596, decided in 1724, was
relied on for the plaintiff. The report is very short. “The defendant
was uncocking a gun, and the plaintiff standing to see it, it went off
and wounded him; and at the trial it was held that the plaintiff might
maintain trespass—Strange <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro defendente</span></i>.” The marginal note in
Nolan’s edition of 1795, not necessarily Strange’s own composition,
is this: “Trespass lies for an accidental hurt;” and in that edition
there is a reference to Buller’s N. P., p. 16. On referring to Buller,
p. 16, where he is dealing with Weaver <em>v.</em> Ward, I find he writes as
follows: “So (it is no battery) if one soldier hurt another in exercise;
but if he plead it he must set forth the circumstances, so as to make it
appear to the court that it was inevitable, and that he committed no
negligence to give occasion to the hurt, for it is not not enough to say
that he did it <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">casualiter, et per infortunium, et contra voluntatem suam</span></i>;
for no man shall be excused of a trespass, unless it be justified entirely
without his default: Weaver <em>v.</em> Ward; and, therefore, it has been
holden that an action lay where the plaintiff standing by to see the
defendant uncock his gun was accidentally wounded: Underwood <em>v.</em>
Hewson.” On referring back to Weaver <em>v.</em> Ward, I can find nothing
in the report to show that the court held, that in order to constitute a
defence in the case of a trespass it is necessary to show that the act
was <em>inevitable</em>. If <em>inevitable</em>, it would seem that there was a defence
under the general issue; but a distinction is drawn between an act
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>which is inevitable and an act which is excusable, and what Weaver <em>v.</em>
Ward really lays down is that “no man shall be excused of a trespass
except it may be judged utterly without his fault.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Day <em>v.</em> Edwards, D. &amp; E. 5 T. R. 648 (1794), merely decides that
where a man negligently <em>drives</em> a cart against the plaintiff’s carriage,
the injury being committed by the <em>immediate</em> act complained of, the
remedy must be trespass, and not case.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the case upon which most reliance was placed by the plaintiff’s
counsel was Leame <em>v.</em> Bray, 3 East, 593. That was an action of trespass
in which the plaintiff complained that the defendant with force
and arms drove and struck a chaise which he was driving on the highway
against the plaintiff’s curricle, which the plaintiff’s servant was
driving, by means whereof the servant was thrown out, and the horses
ran away, and the plaintiff, who jumped out to save his life, was injured.
The facts stated in the report include a statement that “the
accident happened in a dark night, owing to the defendant driving his
carriage on the wrong side of the road, and the parties not being able
to see each other; and that if the defendant had kept his right side
there was ample room for the carriages to have passed without injury.”
The report goes on to state: “But it did not appear that blame was
imputable to the defendant in any <em>other</em> respect as to the manner of his
driving. It was therefore objected for the defendant, that the injury
<em>having happened from negligence</em> and not wilfully, the proper remedy
was by an action on the case, and not of trespass <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi et armis</span></i>; and the
plaintiff was thereupon nonsuited.” On the argument of the rule to
set aside the verdict the whole discussion turned upon the question
whether the injury was, as put by Lawrence, J., at p. 596 of the report,
immediate from the defendant’s act, or consequential only from it, and
in the result the nonsuit was set aside. But it clearly appears from the
report that there was evidence upon which the jury might have found
negligence, and indeed the defendant’s counsel assumed it in the very
objection which prevailed with Lord Ellenborough when he nonsuited
the plaintiff. There is nothing in any of the judgments to show that
if in that case a plea had been pleaded denying any negligence, and the
jury had found that the defendant was not guilty of any negligence,
but (for instance) that the accident happened wholly through the
darkness of the night making it impossible to distinguish one side of
the road from the other and without negligence on either side, the
court would have held that the defendant would have been liable
either in trespass or in case.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the cases to which I have referred were before the Court of
Exchequer in 1875, in the case of Holmes <em>v.</em> Mather, and Bramwell,
B., in giving judgment in that case, dealt with them thus: “As to the
cases cited, most of them are really decisions on the form of action,
whether case or trespass. The result of them is this, and it is intelligible
enough: if the act that does an injury is an act of direct force
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi et armis</span></i>, trespass is the proper remedy (if there is any remedy),
where the act is wrongful either as being wilful or as being the result
of negligence. Where the act is not wrongful for either of these reasons,
no action is maintainable, though trespass would be the proper
form of action if it were wrongful. That is the effect of the decisions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This view of the older authorities is in accordance with a passage
cited by Mr. Dickens from Bacon’s Abridgment, Trespass, I., p. 706,
with a marginal reference to Weaver <em>v.</em> Ward. In Bacon the word
“inevitable” does not find a place. “If the circumstance which is
specially pleaded in an action of trespass do not make the act complained
of lawful” (by which I understand justifiable even if purposely
done to the extent of purposely inflicting the injury, as, for
instance, in a case of self-defence) “and only make it excusable, it
is proper to plead this circumstance in excuse; and it is in this case
necessary for the defendant to show not only that the act complained
of was accidental” (by which I understand, “that the injury was unintentional”),
“but likewise that it was not owing to neglect or want
of due caution.” In the present case the plaintiff sued in respect of
an injury owing to the defendant’s negligence,—there was no pretence
for saying that it was intentional so far as any injury to the
plaintiff was concerned,—and the jury negatived such negligence.
It was argued that nevertheless, inasmuch as the plaintiff was injured
by a shot from the defendant’s gun, that was an injury owing to an
act of force committed by the defendant, and therefore an action
would lie. I am of opinion that this is not so, and that against any
statement of claim which the plaintiff could suggest the defendant
must succeed if he were to plead the facts sworn to by the witnesses
for the defendant in this case, and the jury believing those facts, as
they must now be taken by me to have done, found the verdict which
they have found as regards negligence. In other words, I am of
opinion that if the case is regarded as an action on the case for an
injury by negligence the plaintiff has failed to establish that which is
the very gist of such an action; if, on the other hand, it is turned into
an action for trespass, and the defendant is (as he must be) supposed
to have pleaded a plea denying negligence and establishing that the
injury was accidental in the sense above explained, the verdict of the
jury is equally fatal to the action. I am, therefore, of opinion that I
am bound to give judgment for the defendant. As to costs, they must
follow, unless the defendant foregoes his right.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Tort. The first count in the declaration alleged that, while the
plaintiff was a passenger on an electric car of the defendant, the
car was derailed at Tiverton, owing to the defendant’s negligence,
“whereby the plaintiff was jolted and in many ways injured externally
and internally.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial, plaintiff testified substantially to the same effect as the
allegations in the declaration. As to the derailment, he testified that
it was violent and that he was much thrown about. The evidence for
the defendant tended to show that there was practically no jar when
the car left the rails at Tiverton.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the close of the evidence plaintiff requested, among others, the
following ruling:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. Upon all the evidence the plaintiff is entitled to recover on the
first count.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge refused to so rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge instructed the jury, in part, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The only matters, then, of damages for you to consider are these:
First, what was the effect upon the plaintiff of the jolts when the car
was derailed? To what extent did they injure the plaintiff?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Plaintiff excepted to the charge. Verdict for defendant.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Sheldon, J.</span> No question was made at the trial but that the defendant
was liable for any injury done to the plaintiff by reason of
its car having left the track. But if no injury was caused by this to
the plaintiff, if he suffered no damage whatever from the defendant’s
negligence, then he would not be entitled to recover. Although there
has been negligence in the performance of a legal duty, yet it is only
those who have suffered damage therefrom that may maintain an
action therefor. Heaven <em>v.</em> Pender, 11 Q. B. D. 503, 507; Farrell <em>v.</em>

cases of negligence, there is no such invasion of rights as to entitle
plaintiff to recover at least nominal damages, as in Hooten <em>v.</em> Barnard,

<p class='c014'>Action on the case against owners of a vessel.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a> Plaintiff put in
evidence a bill of lading of chests of tea shipped on board defendant’s
vessel; “to be delivered in good order, unavoidable accidents and the
dangers of the river excepted....” Plaintiff also proved that the
teas were delivered by defendants in a damaged state, owing to their
having been wet. Defendants gave evidence that the boat, when on
her passage up the river, was driven by a sudden squall of wind and
snow sidewise, whereby the teas were wet and damaged; that she was
well fitted for the voyage; that every exertion was made to save her;
and that Samuel Johnston, the captain, was a man of experience. To
rebut this the plaintiff gave evidence that Samuel Johnston was not
an experienced boatman or pilot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judgment below for plaintiff. The original defendants brought
error. One of the errors assigned was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The court below erred in charging the jury, that although the accident
in this case resulted from the act of God, and could not have
been prevented by any human prudence or foresight; and although
it would, in this respect, come within the exception that excuses the
carrier in case of loss: still, if the crew of the boat was not sufficient,
or if she was not under the control of a master or pilot sufficiently
skilled to perform the duties corresponding to his station, the carrier
cannot avail himself of the exception, nor excuse himself from responsibility
to the owner, to the extent of the injury done to the goods.
And also, in substance, that if the jury think that the boat was not
fit for the voyage, or the master not competent, or the crew insufficient;
they ought to find a verdict for the plaintiff, whatever might
be their opinion as to the real cause of the upsetting of the boat.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Gibson, C. J.</span>: Had the judge said no more than that the carrier is
bound to provide a carriage or vessel in all respects adequate to the
purpose, with a conductor or crew of competent skill or ability, and
that “failing in these particulars, though the loss be occasioned by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the act of God, he shall not set up a providential calamity to protect
himself against what <em>may</em> have arisen from his own folly;” there
would have been no room for an exception. But the cause was eventually
put to the jury on a different principle: “though the accident
resulted from the act of God,” it was said, “<em>and could not have been
prevented by any human prudence or foresight</em>, and though it would in
this respect otherwise have come within the exception that excuses the
carrier in case of loss: still, if the crew of the office [?] were not sufficient,
or if she were not under the control of a master or pilot sufficiently
skilful to perform the duties correspondent to his station, the
carrier cannot avail himself of the exception.” By this the jury were
instructed, in accordance, as it was supposed, with the principle of
Bell <em>v.</em> Reed and Beelor, 4 Binn. 127, that want of seaworthiness has
the peculiar effect of casting every loss, from whatever cause, on the
carrier, as a penalty, I presume, for his original delinquency, and not
for its actual or supposed instrumentality in contributing to the disaster,
which is admitted to have been produced, in this instance, by
causes unconnected with the master or crew, and to have been of a
nature which no human force or sagacity could control.</p>

<p class='c007'>Does such a penalty necessarily result from the nature of the contract?
A carrier is answerable for the consequences of negligence,
not the abstract existence of it. Where the goods have arrived safe,
no action lies against him for an intervening but inconsequential act
of carelessness; nor can it be set up as a defence against payment of
the freight; and for this plain reason, that the risk from it was all his
own. Why, then, should it, in any other case, subject him to a loss
which it did not contribute to produce, or give an advantage to one
who was not prejudiced by it? It would require much to reconcile
to any principle of policy or justice, a measure of responsibility which
would cast the burthen of the loss on a carrier whose wagon had been
snatched away by a whirlwind in crossing a bridge, merely because it
had not been furnished with a proper cover or tilt to protect the goods
from the weather. Yet the omission to provide such a cover would be
gross negligence, but, like that imputed to the carrier in the case before
us, such as could have had no imaginable effect on the event. A carrier
is an insurer against all losses without regard to degrees of negligence
in the production of them, except such as have been caused by
an act of providence, or the common enemy: and why is he so? Undoubtedly
to subserve the purposes, not of justice in the particular
instance, but of policy and convenience: of policy, by removing from
him all temptation to confederate with robbers or thieves—and of
convenience, by relieving the owner of the goods from the necessity
of proving actual negligence, which, the fact being peculiarly within
the knowledge of the carrier or his servants, could seldom be done.
Jones on Bail. 108, 109; 2 Kent, 59, 78. Such are the rule and the
reason of it, and such is the exception. But we should enlarge the rule,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>or to speak more properly, narrow the exception far beyond the exigencies
of policy or convenience, did we hold him an insurer against
even the acts of providence, as a punishment for an abstract delinquency,
where there was no room for the existence of a confederacy,
or the operation of actual negligence; and to carry a responsibility,
founded in no principle of natural equity beyond the requirements of
necessity, would be gratuitous injustice. A delinquency which might
have contributed to the disaster, such, for instance, as is imputable to
the owner of a ship driven on a lee shore, for a defect in the rigging or
sails, would undoubtedly be attended with different consequences;
for as it would be impossible to ascertain the exact effect of the delinquency
on the event, the loss would have to be borne by the delinquent
on a very common principle, by which any one whose carelessness has
increased the danger of injury from a sudden commotion of the elements,
is chargeable with all the mischief that may ensue: as in Turberville
<em>v.</em> Stamp, Skin. 681, where it was adjudged, that the negligent
keeping of fire in a close would subject the party to all the consequences,
though proximately produced by a sudden storm; and the
same principle was held by this court in The Lehigh Bridge Company
<em>v.</em> The Lehigh Navigation, 4 Rawle, 9. But it would be too much to
require of the carrier to make good a loss from shipwreck, for having
omitted to provide the ship with proper papers, which are a constituent
part of seaworthiness, and the omission of them an undoubted
negligence.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The first question, therefore, will be, whether the captain and crew
of the boat had the degree of ability and skill thus indicated; and if
it be found that they had not, then the second question will be,
whether the want of it contributed in any degree to the actual disaster:
but if either of these be found for the carrier, it will be decision
[decisive?] of the cause. It seems, therefore, that&#160;... the cause
ought to be put, on these principles, to another jury.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>SPADE <em>v.</em> LYNN &amp; BOSTON R. CO.<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, May 19, 1897.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 168 Massachusetts Reports, 285.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Tort, for personal injuries occasioned to the plaintiff by the alleged
negligence of the defendant. The declaration contained three counts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third count<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a> alleged that while the plaintiff was a passenger in
the defendant’s car, and in the exercise of due care, “one of the defendant’s
agents or servants, in attempting to remove from the said
car a certain person claimed and alleged by said defendant’s agent to
be noisy, turbulent, and unfit to remain as a passenger in said car,
conducted himself with such carelessness, negligence, and with the use
of such unnecessary force, that said agent and servant, acting thus
negligently, created a disorder, disturbance, and quarrel in said car,
and thereby frightened the plaintiff and subjected her to a severe
nervous shock, by which nervous shock the plaintiff was physically
prostrated and suffered, and has continued to suffer, great mental and
physical pain and anguish, and has been put to great expense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant’s answer was a general denial.</p>

<p class='c007'>Trial in the Superior Court, before <span class='sc'>Mason, C. J.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff testified, among other things, that the conductor in
putting off an intoxicated man twitched him in such a way as to push
another intoxicated man over on to the plaintiff. The evidence for
the defendant tended to disprove plaintiff’s claim that either of the
intoxicated persons came in contact with her, or assaulted her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant requested (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>) an instruction, that there was
no evidence to warrant a verdict on the third count. This request
was refused.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge instructed the jury as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now there is a third count to which attention must be called. If
the jury should find that there was no bodily injury to the plaintiff
direct from the acts of the conductor, that is, no person was thrown
against the plaintiff, if that statement is not accurate, the plaintiff
still contends that if the manner of the removal was such that it occasioned
fright and nervous shock that resulted in bodily injury, that she
is still entitled to recover for that bodily injury. And I have to say to
you as matter of law, that if the wrongful acts of the conductor, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>occasion of removing the disorderly passenger, did occasion fright and
nervous shock to the plaintiff, by reason of which she sustained bodily
injury, that she can recover compensation for that injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is settled law in this State that a person cannot recover for
mere fright, fear or mental distress occasioned by the negligence of
another, which does not result in bodily injury.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>“But when the fright or fear or nervous shock produces a bodily
injury, then there may be recovery for that bodily injury, and for all
the pain, mental or otherwise, which may arise out of that bodily
injury. The brain and the nervous system are so closely connected
with the mind, are the instruments by which the mind communicates
with the body and operates upon it, that we sometimes deal with the
nervous conditions as if they were mental conditions, and possibly the
testimony has to some extent treated them as one. But for the purpose
of the principle which I am now stating, a clear distinction exists
between what is mental and what is nervous. The nervous system,
the brain and the nerve fibres, are a part of the body, and injury to
them is bodily injury. Now if by the wrongful acts of this defendant
or its agents, there was a mental shock, fright, and it ended with that,
there can be no recovery. But if that mental shock produced a bodily
injury, a disturbance of the brain or nervous system which continued
and caused subsequent suffering, there may be recovery for that bodily
injury and all that follows from it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To the above instructions, the defendant excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Verdict for plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Allen, J.</span> This case presents a question which has not heretofore
been determined in this Commonwealth, and in respect to which the
decisions elsewhere have not been uniform. It is this: whether in an
action to recover damages for an injury sustained through the negligence
of another, there can be a recovery for a bodily injury caused by
mere fright and mental disturbance. The jury were instructed that a
person cannot recover for mere fright, fear or mental distress occasioned
by the negligence of another, which does not result in bodily
injury,<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a> but that when the fright or fear or nervous shock produces a
bodily injury, there may be a recovery for that bodily injury, and for
all the pain, mental or otherwise, which may arise out of that bodily
injury.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>In Canning <em>v.</em> Williamstown, 1 Cush. 451, it was held, in an action
against a town to recover damages for an injury sustained by the
plaintiff in consequence of a defective bridge, that he could not recover
if he sustained no injury to his person, but merely incurred risk
and peril which caused fright and mental suffering. In Warren <em>v.</em>
Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, 163 Mass. 484, the evidence tended to show
that the defendant’s train struck the carriage of the plaintiff, thereby
throwing him out upon the ground, and it was held to be a physical
injury to the person to be thrown out of a wagon, or to be compelled
to jump out, even although the harm consists mainly of nervous shock.
It was not therefore a case of mere fright, and resulting nervous shock.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case calls for a consideration of the real ground upon which the
liability or non-liability of a defendant guilty of negligence in a case
like the present depends. The exemption from liability for mere
fright, terror, alarm, or anxiety does not rest on the assumption that
these do not constitute an actual injury. They do in fact deprive one
of enjoyment and of comfort, cause real suffering, and to a greater or
less extent disqualify one for the time being from doing the duties of
life. If these results flow from a wrongful or negligent act, a recovery
therefor cannot be denied on the ground that the injury is fanciful and
not real. Nor can it be maintained that these results may not be the
direct and immediate consequence of the negligence. Danger excites
alarm. Few people are wholly insensible to the emotions caused by
imminent danger, though some are less affected than others.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must also be admitted that a timid or sensitive person may suffer
not only in mind, but also in body, from such a cause. Great emotion
may and sometimes does produce physical effects. The action of the
heart, the circulation of the blood, the temperature of the body, as
well as the nerves and the appetite, may all be affected. A physical
injury may be directly traceable to fright, and so may be caused by
it. We cannot say, therefore, that such consequences may not flow
proximately from unintentional negligence, and if compensation in
damages may be recovered for a physical injury so caused, it is hard
on principle to say why there should not also be a recovery for the
mere mental suffering when not accompanied by any perceptible
physical effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would seem, therefore, that the real reason for refusing damages
sustained from mere fright must be something different; and it probably
rests on the ground that in practice it is impossible satisfactorily
to administer any other rule. The law must be administered in the
courts according to general rules. Courts will aim to make these rules
as just as possible, bearing in mind that they are to be of general application.
But as the law is a practical science, having to do with the
affairs of life, any rule is unwise if in its general application it will not
as a usual result serve the purposes of justice. A new rule cannot be
made for each case, and there must therefore be a certain generality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>in rules of law, which in particular cases may fail to meet what would
be desirable if the single case were alone to be considered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rules of law respecting the recovery of damages are framed with
reference to the just rights of both parties; not merely what it might
be right for an injured person to receive, to afford just compensation
for his injury, but also what it is just to compel the other party to
pay. One cannot always look to others to make compensation for
injuries received. Many accidents occur, the consequences of which
the sufferer must bear alone. And in determining the rules of law by
which the right to recover compensation for unintended injury from
others is to be governed, regard must chiefly be paid to such conditions
as are usually found to exist. Not only the transportation of passengers
and the running of trains, but the general conduct of business
and of the ordinary affairs of life, must be done on the assumption
that persons who are liable to be affected thereby are not peculiarly
sensitive, and are of ordinary physical and mental strength. If, for
example, a traveller is sick or infirm, delicate in health, specially
nervous or emotional, liable to be upset by slight causes, and therefore
requiring precautions which are not usual or practicable for
travellers in general, notice should be given, so that, if reasonably
practicable, arrangements may be made accordingly, and extra care be
observed.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a> But, as a general rule, a carrier of passengers is not bound
to anticipate or to guard against an injurious result which would only
happen to a person of peculiar sensitiveness. This limitation of liability
for injury of another description is intimated in Allsop <em>v.</em> Allsop,
5 H. &amp; N. 534, 538, 539. One may be held bound to anticipate and
guard against the probable consequences to ordinary people, but to
carry the rule of damages further imposes an undue measure of responsibility
upon those who are guilty only of unintentional negligence.
The general rule limiting damages in such a case to the natural and
probable consequences of the acts done is of wide application, and has
often been expressed and applied. Lombard <em>v.</em> Lennox, 155 Mass. 70;
White <em>v.</em> Dresser, 135 Mass. 150; Fillebrown <em>v.</em> Hoar, 124 Mass. 580;
Derry <em>v.</em> Flitner, 118 Mass. 131; Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway <em>v.</em>
Kellogg, 94 U. S. 469, 475; Wyman <em>v.</em> Leavitt, 71 Maine, 227; Ellis
<em>v.</em> Cleveland, 55 Vt. 358; Phillips <em>v.</em> Dickerson, 85 Ill. 11; Hampton
<em>v.</em> Jones, 58 Iowa, 317; Renner <em>v.</em> Canfield, 36 Minn. 90; Lynch <em>v.</em>
Knight, 9 H. L. Cas. 577, 591, 595, 598; The Notting Hill, 9 P. D. 105;
Hobbs <em>v.</em> London &amp; Southwestern Railway, L. R. 10 Q. B. 111, 122.</p>

<p class='c007'>The law of negligence in its special application to cases of accidents
has received great development in recent years. The number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>actions brought is very great. This should lead courts well to consider
the grounds on which claims for compensation properly rest, and
the necessary limitations of the right to recover. We remain satisfied
with the rule that there can be no recovery for fright, terror, alarm,
anxiety, or distress of mind, if these are unaccompanied by some
physical injury; and if this rule is to stand, we think it should also be
held that there can be no recovery for such physical injuries as may be
caused solely by such mental disturbance, where there is no injury to
the person from without. The logical vindication of this rule is, that
it is unreasonable to hold persons who are merely negligent bound to
anticipate and guard against fright and the consequences of fright;
and that this would open a wide door for unjust claims, which could
not successfully be met. These views are supported by the following
decisions: Victorian Railways Commissioners <em>v.</em> Coultas, 13 App. Cas.
222; Mitchell <em>v.</em> Rochester Railway, 151 N. Y. 107; Ewing <em>v.</em> Pittsburg,
Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Railway, 147 Penn. St. 40;
Haile <em>v.</em> Texas &amp; Pacific Railway, 60 Fed. Rep. 557.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the following cases, a different view was taken: Bell <em>v.</em> Great
Northern Railway, 26 L. R. (Ir.) 428; Purcell <em>v.</em> St. Paul City Railway,
48 Minn. 134; Fitzpatrick <em>v.</em> Great Western Railway, 12 U. C.
Q. B. 645. See also Beven, Negligence, 77 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i></p>

<p class='c007'>It is hardly necessary to add that this decision does not reach those
classes of actions where an intention to cause mental distress or to
hurt the feelings is shown, or is reasonably to be inferred, as for example,
in cases of seduction, slander, malicious prosecution or arrest,
and some others. Nor do we include cases of acts done with gross
carelessness or recklessness, showing utter indifference to such consequences,
when they must have been in the actor’s mind. Lombard <em>v.</em>
Lennox, and Fillebrown <em>v.</em> Hoar, already cited. Meagher <em>v.</em> Driscoll,

<p class='c014'>Point of law raised by pleadings.<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The statement of claim was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. The plaintiff is the wife of Arthur David Dulieu, who carries
on the business of a licensed victualler at the Bonner Arms, Bonner
Street, Bethnal Green, in the county of London.</p>

<p class='c007'>“2. On July 20, 1900, the plaintiff was behind the bar of her husband’s
said public-house, she being then pregnant, when the defendants
by their servant so negligently drove a pair-horse van as to drive
it into the said public-house.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“3. The defendants were also negligent in entrusting the driving
of the said horses and van to their said servant, who had no knowledge
or skill in driving.</p>

<p class='c007'>“4. The plaintiff in consequence sustained a severe shock, and was
and is seriously ill, and on September 29, 1900, gave premature birth
to a child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“5. In consequence of the shock sustained by the plaintiff the said
child was born an idiot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The plaintiff claims damages in respect of the aforesaid matters.”</p>

in the statement of claim proceeded:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Kennedy, J.</span> In this case the only question for the judgment of the
court is in the nature of a demurrer.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The head of damage alleged in paragraph 5 was rightly treated by
the plaintiff’s counsel as untenable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant’s counsel summed up his contention against the
legal validity of the plaintiff’s claim in the statement that no action
for negligence will lie where there is no immediate physical injury
resulting to the plaintiff.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>This is an action on the case for negligence—that is to say, for
a breach on the part of the defendant’s servant of the duty to use
reasonable and proper care and skill in the management of the defendant’s
van. In order to succeed, the plaintiff has to prove resulting
damage to herself and “a natural and continuous sequence uninterruptedly
connecting the breach of duty with the damage as cause and
effect.” Shearman and Redfield, Negligence, cited in Beven, Negligence
in Law, 2d ed. p. 7. In regard to the existence of the duty here,
there can, I think, be no question. The driver of a van and horses in
a highway owes a duty to use reasonable and proper care and skill so
as not to injure either persons lawfully using the highway, or property
adjoining the highway, or persons who, like the plaintiff are lawfully
occupying that property. His legal duty towards all appears to me
to be practically identical in character and in degree. I understood
the plaintiff’s counsel to suggest that there might exist a higher degree
of duty towards the plaintiff sitting in a house than would have existed
had she been in the street. I am not satisfied that this is so. The
wayfarer in the street, as it seems to me, has in law as much right of
redress if he is injured in person or in property by the negligence of
another as the man who is lawfully sitting on a side-wall or in an
adjoining house. “The whole law of negligence assumes the principle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>of ‘Volenti non fit injuria’ not to be applicable,” for reasons which
Sir Frederick Pollock points out (The Law of Torts, by Sir F. Pollock,
6th ed. pp. 166, 167), in a passage which follows the quotation which
I have just made. The legal obligations of the driver of horses are the
same, I think, towards the man indoors as to the man out of doors;
the only question here is whether there is an actionable breach of those
obligations if the man in either case is made ill in body by such
negligent driving as does not break his ribs but shocks his nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before proceeding to consider the objections to the maintenance of
such a claim as that of the present plaintiff, it is, I think, desirable for
clearness’ sake to see exactly what are the facts which ought to be
assumed for the purposes of the argument. We must assume in her
favor all that can be assumed consistently with the allegations of the
statement of claim. We must, therefore, take it as proved that the
negligent driving of the defendants’ servant reasonably and naturally
caused a nervous or mental shock to the plaintiff by her reasonable
apprehension of immediate bodily hurt, and that the premature childbirth,
with the physical pain and suffering which accompanied it, was
a natural and a direct consequence of the shock. I may just say in
passing that I use the words “nervous” and “mental” as interchangeable
epithets on the authority of the judgment of the Privy
Council in Victorian Railways Commissioners <em>v.</em> Coultas, 13 App. Cas.
222; but I venture to think “nervous” is probably the more correct
epithet where terror operates through parts of the physical organism
to produce bodily illness as in the present case. The use of the epithet
“mental” requires caution, in view of the undoubted rule that merely
mental pain unaccompanied by any injury to the person cannot
sustain an action of this kind. Beven, Negligence in Law, 2d ed. p. 77.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, these being the assumed facts, what are the defendants’
arguments against the plaintiff’s right to recover damages in this
action?</p>

<p class='c007'>First of all, it is argued, fright caused by negligence is not in itself
a cause of action—ergo, none of its consequences can give a cause of
action. In Mitchell <em>v.</em> Rochester Ry. Co., (1896) 151 N. Y. 107, the
point is put thus: “That the result may be nervous disease, blindness,
insanity, or even a miscarriage, in no way changes the principle.
These results merely show the degree of fright or the extent of the
damages. The right of action must still depend upon the question
whether a recovery may be had for fright.” With all respect to the
learned judges who have so held, I feel a difficulty in following this
reasoning. No doubt damage is an essential element in a right of
action for negligence. I cannot successfully sue him who has failed
in his duty of using reasonable skill and care towards me unless I can
prove some material and measurable damage. If his negligence has
caused me neither injury to property nor physical mischief, but only
an unpleasant emotion of more or less transient duration, an essential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>constituent of a right of action for negligence is lacking. “Fear,” as
Sir Frederick Pollock has stated (The Law of Torts, 6th ed. p. 51),
“taken alone falls short of being actual damage not because it is a
remote or unlikely consequence, but because it can be proved and
measured only by physical effects.” It may, I conceive, be truly said
that, viewed in relation to an action for negligence, direct bodily impact
is, without resulting damage, as insufficient a ground of legal
claim as the infliction of fright. That fright—where physical injury
is directly produced by it—cannot be a ground of action merely
because of the absence of any accompanying impact appears to me to
be a contention both unreasonable and contrary to the weight of
authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The learned judge then cited cases in which an action was held to
lie, where the only physical impact did not accompany but was a
consequence of the fright; also a case where there was nothing in the
nature of impact and yet recovery was allowed.]</p>

<p class='c007'>If impact be not necessary, and if, as must be assumed here, the
fear is proved to have naturally and directly produced physical effects,
so that the ill results of the negligence which caused the fear are as
measurable in damages as the same results would be if they arose
from an actual impact, why should not an action for those damages
lie just as well as it lies where there has been an actual impact? It is
not, however, to be taken that in my view every nervous shock occasioned
by negligence and producing physical injury to the sufferer
gives a cause of action. There is, I am inclined to think, at least one
limitation. The shock, where it operates through the mind, must be
a shock which arises from a reasonable fear of immediate personal
injury to oneself. A. has, I conceive, no legal duty not to shock B.’s
nerves by the exhibition of negligence towards C., or towards the
property of B. or C. The limitation was applied by Wright and
Bruce, JJ., in the unreported case of Smith <em>v.</em> Johnson &amp; Co., referred
to by Wright, J., at the close of his judgment in Wilkinson <em>v.</em> Downton,
[1897] 2 Q. B. 57, at p. 61. In Smith <em>v.</em> Johnson &amp; Co. (unreported),
a man was killed by the defendant’s negligence in the sight
of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff became ill, not from the shock produced
by fear of harm to himself, but from the shock of seeing another
person killed. The court held that this harm was too remote a consequence
of the negligence.<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a> I should myself, as I have already indicated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>have been inclined to go a step further, and to hold upon the
facts in Smith <em>v.</em> Johnson &amp; Co. that, as the defendant neither intended
to affect the plaintiff injuriously nor did anything which could
reasonably or naturally be expected to affect him injuriously, there
was no evidence of any breach of legal duty towards the plaintiff or in
regard to him of that absence of care according to the circumstances
which Willes, J., in Vaughan <em>v.</em> Taff Vale Ry. Co., (1860) 5 H. &amp; N.
679, at p. 688, gave as a definition of negligence.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>In order to illustrate my meaning in the concrete, I say that I
should not be prepared in the present case to hold that the plaintiff
was entitled to maintain this action if the nervous shock was produced,
not by the fear of bodily injury to herself, but by horror or
vexation arising from the sight of mischief being threatened or done
either to some other person, or to her own or her husband’s property,
by the intrusion of the defendants’ van and horses. The cause of the
nervous shock is one of the things which the jury will have to determine
at the trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>It remains to consider the second and somewhat different form in
which the defendants’ counsel put his objection to the right of the
plaintiff to maintain this action. He contended that the damages are
too remote, and relied much upon the decision of the Privy Council
in Victorian Railways Commissioners <em>v.</em> Coultas, 13 App. Cas. 222.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The principal ground of their judgment is formulated in the following
sentence: “Damages arising from mere sudden terror unaccompanied
by any actual physical injury, but occasioning a nervous or
mental shock, cannot under such circumstances, their Lordships
think, be considered a consequence which, in the ordinary course of
things, would flow from the negligence of the gate-keeper.”</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>Why is the accompaniment of physical injury essential? For my
own part, I should not like to assume it to be scientifically true that
a nervous shock which causes serious bodily illness is not actually
accompanied by physical injury, although it may be impossible, or at
least difficult, to detect the injury at the time in the living subject.
I should not be surprised if the surgeon or the physiologist told us
that nervous shock is or may be in itself an injurious affection of the
physical organism. Let it be assumed, however, that the physical
injury follows the shock, but that the jury are satisfied upon proper
and sufficient medical evidence that it follows the shock as its direct
and natural effect, is there any legal reason for saying that the damage
is less proximate in the legal sense than damage which arises contemporaneously?
“As well might it be said” (I am quoting from the
judgment of Palles, C. B., 26 L. R. Ir. at p. 439) “that a death caused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>by poison is not to be attributed to the person who administered it
because the mortal effect is not produced contemporaneously with its
administration.” Remoteness as a legal ground for the exclusion of
damage in an action of tort means, not severance in point of time, but
the absence of direct and natural causal sequence—the inability to
trace in regard to the damage the “propter hoc” in a necessary or
natural descent from the wrongful act. As a matter of experience, I
should say that the injury to health which forms the main ground of
damages in actions of negligence, either in cases of railway accidents
or in running-down cases, frequently is proved, not as a concomitant
of the occurrence, but as one of the sequelæ.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>[As to Mitchell <em>v.</em> Rochester Ry. Co., 151 N. Y. 107, cited by defendant.]
Shortly, the facts there were that the plaintiff, whilst waiting
for a tram-car, was nearly run over by the negligent management of
the defendant’s servant of a car drawn by a pair of horses, and owing
to terror so caused fainted, lost consciousness, and subsequently had
a miscarriage and consequent illness.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>It may be admitted that the plaintiff in this American case would
not have suffered exactly as she did, and probably not to the same
extent as she did, if she had not been pregnant at the time; and no
doubt the driver of the defendant’s horses could not anticipate that
she was in this condition. But what does that fact matter? If a man
is negligently run over or otherwise negligently injured in his body,
it is no answer to the sufferer’s claim for damages that he would have
suffered less injury, or no injury at all, if he had not had an unusually
thin skull or an unusually weak heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>[After commenting on the opinion in Spade <em>v.</em> Lynn &amp; Boston R. R.,
168 Mass. 285.]</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally one is diffident of one’s opinion when one finds that it is
not in accord with those which have been expressed by such judicial
authorities as those to which I have just referred. But certainly, if,
as is admitted, and I think justly admitted, by the Massachusetts
judgment, a claim for damages for physical injuries naturally and
directly resulting from nervous shock which is due to the negligence
of another in causing fear of immediate bodily hurt is in principle not
too remote to be recoverable in law, I should be sorry to adopt a rule
which would bar all such claims on grounds of policy alone, and in
order to prevent the possible success of unrighteous or groundless
actions. Such a course involves the denial of redress in meritorious
cases, and it necessarily implies a certain degree of distrust, which I
do not share, in the capacity of legal tribunals to get at the truth in
this class of claims. My experience gives me no reason to suppose
that a jury would really have more difficulty in weighing the medical
evidence as to the effects of nervous shock through fright, than in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>weighing the like evidence as to the effects of nervous shock through
a railway collision or a carriage accident, where, as often happens, no
palpable injury, or very slight palpable injury, has been occasioned
at the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have now, I think, dealt with the authorities and the arguments
upon which the defendants rely, and I have done so at greater length
than I should have wished to do but for the general interest of the
points involved and the difficulties which the conflict of authorities
undoubtedly present. In this conflict I prefer, as I have already indicated,
the two decisions of the Irish courts. They seem to me to
constitute strong and clear authorities for the plaintiff’s contention.
It was suggested on the part of the defendants that the applicability
of the judgment in Bell <em>v.</em> Great Northern Company of Ireland, 26
L. R. Ir. 428, is affected by the fact that the female in that action was
a passenger on the defendant’s railway, and as such had contractual
rights. It appears to me that in the circumstances this fact can make
no practical difference whatever. In the Irish case there was no special
contract, no notice to the railway company, when they accepted her
as a passenger, that she was particularly delicate, or peculiarly nervous
or liable to fright. The contractual duty existed, as it often does
exist, concurrently with the duty apart from contract; but the one is
in such circumstances practically co-extensive with the other in the
rights which it gives and the corresponding liabilities which it imposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>I hold that, if on the trial of this action the jury find the issues left
to them as the jury found them in Bell <em>v.</em> Great Northern Railway
Company of Ireland, 26 L. R. Ir. 428, after the direction of Andrews,
J., which was approved by the Exchequer Division, the plaintiff will
have made out a good cause of action.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Phillimore, J.</span></p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>I think there may be cases in which A. owes a duty to B. not to
inflict a mental shock on him or her, and that in such a case, if A. does
inflict such a shock upon B.—as by terrifying B.—and physical
damage thereby ensues, B. may have an action for the physical
damage, though the medium through which it has been inflicted is
the mind.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>I think there is some assistance to be got from the cases where fear
of impending danger has induced a passenger to take means of escape
which have in the result proved injurious to him, and where the carrier
has been held liable for these injuries, as in Jones <em>v.</em> Boyce, 1 Stark.
493.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>[The learned judge thought it possible that he might have come to
the same conclusion as that arrived at in Victorian Railways Commissioners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span><em>v.</em> Coultas, though not for the reasons which have prominence
in the judgment. He also thought that he should have come to the
same decision as the Massachusetts court in Spade <em>v.</em> Lynn &amp; Boston
R. R.; but that he should not have expressed it in such broad and
sweeping language.]</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>In the case before us the plaintiff, a pregnant woman, was in her
house. It is said that she was not the tenant in possession and could
not maintain trespass <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quare clausum fregit</span></i> if this had been a direct
act of the defendant and not of his servant (as it was). This is true:
her husband was in possession. But none the less it was her home,
where she had a right, and on some occasions a duty, to be; and it
seems to me that if the tenant himself could maintain an action, his
wife or child could do likewise. It is averred that by reason of the
careless driving of the defendants’ servant a pair-horse van came some
way into the room, and so frightened her that serious physical consequences
thereby befell her. If these averments be proved, I think
that there was a breach of duty to her for which she can have damages.
The difficulty in these cases is to my mind not one as to the
remoteness of the damage, but as to the uncertainty of there being
any duty. Once get the duty and the physical damage following on
the breach of duty, and I hold that the fact of one link in the chain of
causation being mental only makes no difference. The learned counsel
for the plaintiff has put it that every link is physical in the narrow
sense. That may be or may not be. For myself, it is unimportant.</p>

  <h5 class='c013'>WILKINSON <em>v.</em> DOWNTON<br /> <span class='sc'>Queen’s Bench Division, May 8, 1897.</span><br /> <cite>Law Reports, [1897] 2 Queen’s Bench, 57.</cite></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Wright, J.</span><a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a> In this case the defendant, in the execution of what
he seems to have regarded as a practical joke, represented to the plaintiff
that he was charged by her husband with a message to her to the
effect that her husband was smashed up in an accident, and was lying
at The Elms at Leytonstone with both legs broken, and that she was
to go at once in a cab with two pillows to fetch him home. All this was
false. The effect of the statement on the plaintiff was a violent shock
to her nervous system, producing vomiting and other more serious and
permanent physical consequences at one time threatening her reason,
and entailing weeks of suffering and incapacity to her as well as expense
to her husband for medical attendance. These consequences
were not in any way the result of previous ill-health or weakness of
constitution; nor was there any evidence of predisposition to nervous
shock or any other idiosyncrasy.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to these matters of substance there is a small claim for
1<em>s.</em> 10½<em>d.</em> for the cost of railway fares of persons sent by the plaintiff
to Leytonstone in obedience to the pretended message. As to this
1<em>s.</em> 10½<em>d.</em> expended in railway fares on the faith of the defendant’s
statement, I think the case is clearly within the decision in Pasley <em>v.</em>
Freeman, (1789) 3 T. R. 51. The statement was a misrepresentation
intended to be acted on to the damage of the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>The real question is as to the 100<em>l.</em>, the greatest part of which is
given as compensation for the female plaintiff’s illness and suffering.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>It was argued for her that she is entitled to recover this as being damage
caused by fraud, and therefore within the doctrine established by
Pasley <em>v.</em> Freeman, (1789) 3 T. R. 51, and Langridge <em>v.</em> Levy, (1837)
2 M. &amp; W. 519. I am not sure that this would not be an extension of
that doctrine, the real ground of which appears to be that a person
who makes a false statement intended to be acted on must make good
the damage naturally resulting from its being acted on. Here there is
no injuria of that kind. I think, however, that the verdict may be
supported upon another ground. The defendant has, as I assume for
the moment, wilfully done an act calculated to cause physical harm
to the plaintiff—that is to say, to infringe her legal right to personal
safety, and has in fact thereby caused physical harm to her. That
proposition without more appears to me to state a good cause of
action, there being no justification alleged for the act. This wilful
injuria is in law malicious, although no malicious purpose to cause the
harm which was caused nor any motive of spite is imputed to the
defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>It remains to consider whether the assumptions involved in the proposition
are made out. One question is whether the defendant’s act
was so plainly calculated to produce some effect of the kind which was
produced that an intention to produce it ought to be imputed to the
defendant, regard being had to the fact that the effect was produced
on a person proved to be in an ordinary state of health and mind. I
think that it was. It is difficult to imagine that such a statement,
made suddenly and with apparent seriousness, could fail to produce
grave effects under the circumstances upon any but an exceptionally
indifferent person, and therefore an intention to produce such an effect
must be imputed, and it is no answer in law to say that more harm was
done than was anticipated, for that is commonly the case with all
wrongs. The other question is whether the effect was, to use the
ordinary phrase, too remote to be in law regarded as a consequence
for which the defendant is answerable. Apart from authority, I
should give the same answer and on the same ground as the last question,
and say that it was not too remote. Whether, as the majority
of the House of Lords thought in Lynch <em>v.</em> Knight, (1861) 9. H. L. C.
577, at pp. 592, 596, the criterion is in asking what would be the
natural effect on reasonable persons, or whether, as Lord Wensleydale
thought (9 H. L. C. 587, at p. 600), the possible infirmities of human
nature ought to be recognized, it seems to me that the connection
between the cause and the effect is sufficiently close and complete.
It is, however, necessary to consider two authorities which are supposed
to have laid down that illness through mental shock is a too
remote or unnatural consequence of an injuria to entitle the plaintiff
to recover in a case where damage is a necessary part of the cause of
action. One is the case of Victorian Railways Commissioners <em>v.</em>
Coultas, 13 App. Cas. 222, where it was held in the Privy Council
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>that illness which was the effect of shock caused by fright was too
remote a consequence of a negligent act which caused the fright, there
being no physical harm immediately caused. That decision was
treated in the Court of Appeal in Pugh <em>v.</em> London, Brighton and South
Coast Ry. Co., [1896] 2 Q. B. 248, as open to question. It is inconsistent
with a decision in the Court of Appeal in Ireland: Bell <em>v.</em> Great
Northern Ry. Co. of Ireland, (1890) 26 L. R. Ir. 428, where the Irish
Exchequer Division refused to follow it; and it has been disapproved
in the Supreme Court of New York; see Pollock on Torts, 4th ed.
p. 47 (<em>n</em>). Nor is it altogether in point, for there was not in that case
any element of wilful wrong; nor perhaps was the illness so direct and
natural a consequence of the defendant’s conduct as in this case. On
these grounds it seems to me that the case of Victorian Railways Commissioners
<em>v.</em> Coultas, 13 App. Cas. 222, is not an authority on which
this case ought to be decided.</p>

<p class='c007'>A more serious difficulty is the decision in Allsop <em>v.</em> Allsop, 5 H. &amp;
N. 534, which was approved by the House of Lords in Lynch <em>v.</em>
Knight, 9 H. L. C. 577. In that case it was held by Pollock, C. B.,
Martin, Bramwell, and Wilde, BB., that illness caused by a slanderous
imputation of unchastity in the case of a married woman did not constitute
such special damage as would sustain an action for such a
slander. That case, however, appears to have been decided on the
ground that in all the innumerable actions for slander there were no
precedents for alleging illness to be sufficient special damage, and that
it would be of evil consequence to treat it as sufficient, because such
a rule might lead to an infinity of trumpery or groundless actions.
Neither of these reasons is applicable to the present case. Nor could
such a rule be adopted as of general application without results which
it would be difficult or impossible to defend. Suppose that a person
is in a precarious and dangerous condition, and another person tells
him that his physician has said that he has but a day to live. In such
a case, if death ensued from the shock caused by the false statement,
I cannot doubt that at this day the case might be one of criminal
homicide, or that if a serious aggravation of illness ensued damages
might be recovered. I think, however, that it must be admitted that
the present case is without precedent. Some English decisions—such
as Jones <em>v.</em> Boyce, (1816) 1 Stark. 493; Wilkins <em>v.</em> Day, (1883) 12
Q. B. D. 110; Harris <em>v.</em> Mobbs, (1878) 3 Ex. D. 268—are cited in
Beven on Negligence as inconsistent with the decision in Victorian
Railways Commissioners <em>v.</em> Coultas, 13 App. Cas. 222. But I think
that those cases are to be explained on a different ground, namely,
that the damage which immediately resulted from the act of the passenger
or of the horse was really the result not of that act, but of a
fright which rendered that act involuntary, and which therefore ought
to be regarded as itself the direct and immediate cause of the damage.
In Smith <em>v.</em> Johnson &amp; Co. (unreported), decided in January last,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Bruce, J., and I held that where a man was killed in the sight of the
plaintiff by the defendant’s negligence, and the plaintiff became ill,
not from the shock from fear of harm to himself, but from the shock
of seeing another person killed, this harm was too remote a consequence
of the negligence. But that was a very different case from the
present.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>YATES <em>v.</em> SOUTH KIRKBY COLLIERIES<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Court of Appeal, July 6, 1910.</span><br /> <em>Reported in [1910] 2 King’s Bench, 538.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Appeal against the award of the judge of the county court of Pontefract
sitting as arbitrator under the Workmen’s Compensation Act,
1906.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question raised by this appeal was whether a nervous shock
received by a workman in the course of his employment was an “accident”
which entitled him to compensation under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act, 1906. The facts as found by the county court
judge were as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>In October, 1909, the applicant,—a collier, forty-six years of age,
who had been engaged in coal mining all his life, and for twenty-seven
years had been working at the face of the coal in the pit belonging
to the respondents,—while working as usual, heard a shout for
help from the next working place. He ran around his loose end at
once and found a fellow collier lying full length on the ground, having
been knocked down by a fallen timber prop and some coal; he was
bleeding all over his head and from his ears and eyes. The applicant
picked him up in his arms and, with assistance, carried him away; he
was not dead at the time, but died in a quarter of an hour. The effect
on the applicant was such that he sustained a nervous shock, which
incapacitated him from working at the coal face; he returned to his
work on the Saturday, and at the order of the under-manager on the
Monday following, but on neither occasion was he able to do work,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and after describing to the under-manager and the Government inspector
on the Monday the details of what happened on the Saturday
he left the pit; he then consulted his doctor and has been under his
care since. In November he tried again to work, and went to his old
place, but though he stayed the shift he was unable to work, and his
brother, who was his mate, did it for him. In January, 1910, he asked
the under-manager for a by-work job, but the under-manager would
not give him one, and he had not worked since.</p>

<p class='c007'>Proceedings for compensation having been taken, the county court
judge found as a fact that there was a genuine incapacity to work
which was due to the nervous shock which he sustained in October,
1909, when it clearly was his duty to his employers to go to the assistance
of the injured collier who shouted for help from the next
working place, and that his doing so arose both “in course of” and
“out of” his employment. The learned county court judge accordingly
awarded the applicant compensation at 19<em>s.</em> a week to the date
of the award, and 10<em>s.</em> a week till further order.</p>

<p class='c007'>The respondents appealed.<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Farwell, L. J.</span> I am of the same opinion. It is rightly conceded
that it was part of the man’s duty to go to the assistance of his fellow
workman. Therefore there is no question that the events arose
“out of and in the course of the employment.” The learned county
court judge has found as a fact that there was a genuine incapacity to
work, which was due to the nervous shock which the applicant sustained
in October last. In my opinion nervous shock due to accident
which causes personal incapacity to work is as much “personal injury
by accident” as a broken leg, for the reasons already expressed
by this court in the case of Eaves <em>v.</em> Blaenclydach Colliery Co., [1909]
2 K. B. 73. In truth I find it difficult, when the medical evidence is
that as a fact a workman is suffering from a known complaint arising
from nervous shock, to draw any distinction between that case and the
case of a broken limb. I see no distinction for this purpose between
the case of the guard who is not in fact physically injured by an accident
to his train, but who, after assisting to carry away the wounded
and dead, breaks down from nervous shock, and the case of the guard
who in similar circumstances stumbles over some of the débris and
breaks his leg.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c015'><sup>[56]</sup></a> The difficulty is to prove the facts so as to avoid the
risk of malingering, but when the facts have been proved, the injury
causing incapacity to work arises from the accident in the one case
just as much as in the other. I am, therefore, of opinion that the
judgment of the learned county court judge must be affirmed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span><span class='sc'>Kennedy, L. J.</span> I am of the same opinion. It is beyond question
that the incapacity of the applicant has arisen in the course of and out
of the employment; and when you have a finding of fact by the learned
county court judge that there has been a nervous shock, and that
that nervous shock has produced a genuine condition of neurasthenia,
I think myself the recent authorities show that this judgment ought
to be supported. One knows perfectly well that neurasthenia, although
there may be no outward sign if you merely look at the person, is
treated, and successfully treated in some cases at any rate, by a treatment
of the body. Directly you have that which requires treatment
of the body, it means that a portion of that body (visible or invisible
does not matter) is in a state of ill-health, and, if the condition of
neurasthenia produces incapacity to work which has been brought
about by something in the nature of an accident which arose “out of
and in the course of the employment,” you have a case of “personal
injury by accident” which is within the Act.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>VAUGHAN <em>v.</em> MENLOVE<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Common Pleas, January 23, 1837.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 3 Bingham’s New Cases, 468.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>The declaration alleged, in substance, that plaintiff was the owner
of two cottages; that defendant owned land near to the said cottages;
that defendant had a rick or stack of hay near the boundary of his
land which was liable and likely to ignite, and thereby was dangerous
to the plaintiff’s cottages; that the defendant, well knowing the
premises, wrongfully and negligently kept and continued the rick in
the aforesaid dangerous condition; that the rick did ignite, and that
plaintiff’s cottages were burned by fire communicated from the rick
or from certain buildings of defendant’s which were set on fire by
flames from the rick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant pleaded the general issue; and also several special pleas,
denying negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>At the trial it appeared that the rick in question had been made by
the defendant near the boundary of his own premises; that the hay
was in such a state when put together, as to give rise to discussions
on the probability of fire; that though there were conflicting opinions
on the subject, yet during a period of five weeks the defendant was
repeatedly warned of his peril; that his stock was insured; and that
upon one occasion, being advised to take the rick down to avoid all
danger, he said “he would chance it.” He made an aperture or chimney
through the rick; but in spite, or perhaps in consequence of this
precaution, the rick at length burst into flames from the spontaneous
heating of its materials; the flames communicated to the defendant’s
barn and stables, and thence to the plaintiff’s cottages, which were
entirely destroyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Patteson, J., before whom the cause was tried, told the jury that
the question for them to consider was, whether the fire had been occasioned
by gross negligence on the part of the defendant; adding, that
he was bound to proceed with such reasonable caution as a prudent
man would have exercised under such circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>A verdict having been found for the plaintiff, a rule nisi for a new
trial was obtained, on the ground that the jury should have been directed
to consider, not whether the defendant had been guilty of a
gross negligence with reference to the standard of ordinary prudence,
a standard too uncertain to afford any criterion, but whether he had
acted <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> to the best of his judgment; if he had, he ought not
to be responsible for the misfortune of not possessing the highest order
of intelligence. The action under such circumstances was of the first
impression.<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><em>Talfourd</em>, Serjt., and <em>Whately</em>, showed cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pleas having expressly raised issues on the negligence of the
defendant, the learned judge could not do otherwise than leave that
question to the jury. The declaration alleges that the defendant
knew of the dangerous state of the rick, and yet negligently and improperly
allowed it to stand. The plea of not guilty, therefore, puts
in issue the scienter, it being of the substance of the issue: Thomas <em>v.</em>
Morgan, 2 Cr. M. &amp; R. 496. And the action, though new <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in specie</span></i>,
is founded on a principle fully established, that a man must so use his
own property as not to injure that of others. On the same circuit a
defendant was sued a few years ago for burning weeds so near the
extremity of his own land as to set fire to and destroy his neighbors’
wood. The plaintiff recovered damages, and no motion was made to
set aside the verdict. Then, there were no means of estimating the
defendant’s negligence, except by taking as a standard the conduct
of a man of ordinary prudence: that has been the rule always laid
down, and there is no other that would not be open to much greater
uncertainties.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span><em>R. V. Richards</em>, in support of the rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, there was no duty imposed on the defendant, as there is on
carriers or other bailees, under an implied contract, to be responsible
for the exercise of any given degree of prudence: the defendant had
a right to place his stack as near to the extremity of his own land as
he pleased, Wyatt <em>v.</em> Harrison, 3 B. &amp; Adol. 871: under that right,
and subject to no contract, he can only be called on to act <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> to
the best of his judgment; if he has done that, it is a contradiction in
terms, to inquire whether or not he has been guilty of gross negligence.
At all events what would have been gross negligence ought to be estimated
by the faculties of the individual, and not by those of other
men. The measure of prudence varies so with the varying faculties
of men, that it is impossible to say what is gross negligence with reference
to the standard of what is called ordinary prudence. In Crook <em>v.</em>
Jadis, 5 B. &amp; Adol. 910, Patteson, J., says, “I never could understand
what is meant by parties taking a bill under circumstances which
ought to have excited the suspicion of a prudent man;” and Taunton,
J., “I cannot estimate the degree of care which a prudent man should
take.”...</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tindal, C. J.</span> I agree that this is a case <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ impressionis</span></i>; but
I feel no difficulty in applying to it the principles of law as laid down
in other cases of a similar kind. Undoubtedly this is not a case of
contract, such as a bailment or the like, where the bailee is responsible
in consequence of the remuneration he is to receive: but there is a
rule of law which says you must so enjoy your own property as not
to injure that of another; and according to that rule the defendant is
liable for the consequence of his own neglect: and though the defendant
did not himself light the fire, yet mediately he is as much the cause
of it as if he had himself put a candle to the rick; for it is well known
that hay will ferment and take fire if it be not carefully stacked. It
has been decided that if an occupier burns weeds so near the boundary
of his own land that damage ensues to the property of his neighbor, he
is liable to an action for the amount of injury done, unless the accident
were occasioned by a sudden blast which he could not foresee. Turberville
<em>v.</em> Stamp, 1 Salk. 13. But put the case of a chemist making
experiments with ingredients, singly innocent, but when combined
liable to ignite; if he leaves them together, and injury is thereby
occasioned to the property of his neighbor, can any one doubt that an
action on the case would lie?</p>

<p class='c007'>It is contended, however, that the learned judge was wrong in leaving
this to the jury as a case of gross negligence, and that the question
of negligence was so mixed up with reference to what would be the
conduct of a man of ordinary prudence that the jury might have
thought the latter the rule by which they were to decide; that such a
rule would be too uncertain to act upon; and that the question ought
to have been whether the defendant had acted honestly and <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>to the best of his own judgment. That, however, would leave so vague
a line as to afford no rule at all, the degree of judgment belonging to
each individual being infinitely various: and though it has been urged
that the care which a prudent man would take, is not an intelligible
proposition as a rule of law, yet such has always been the rule adopted
in cases of bailment, as laid down in Coggs <em>v.</em> Bernard, 2 Ld. Raym.
909. Though in some cases a greater degree of care is exacted than in
others, yet in “the second sort of bailment, viz., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">commodatum</span></i> or lending
gratis, the borrower is bound to the strictest care and diligence to
keep the goods so as to restore them back again to the lender; because
the bailee has a benefit by the use of them, so as if the bailee be guilty
of the least neglect he will be answerable; as if a man should lend
another a horse to go westward, or for a month; if the bailee put this
horse in his stable, and he were stolen from thence, the bailee shall not
be answerable for him; but if he or his servant leave the house or
stable doors open, and the thieves take the opportunity of that, and
steal the horse, he will be chargeable, because the neglect gave the
thieves the occasion to steal the horse.” The care taken by a prudent
man has always been the rule laid down; and as to the supposed difficulty
of applying it, a jury has always been able to say, whether,
taking that rule as their guide, there has been negligence on the
occasion in question.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead, therefore, of saying that the liability for negligence should
be co-extensive with the judgment of each individual, which would be
as variable as the length of the foot of each individual, we ought rather
to adhere to the rule, which requires in all cases a regard to caution
such as a man of ordinary prudence would observe.<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c015'><sup>[58]</sup></a> That was in substance
the criterion presented to the jury in this case, and therefore
the present rule must be discharged.</p>

  <h5 class='c013'>BLYTH <em>v.</em> BIRMINGHAM WATERWORKS CO.<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Exchequer, February 6, 1856.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 11 Exchequer, 781.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This was an appeal by the defendants against the decision of the
judge of the County Court of Birmingham. The case was tried before
a jury, and a verdict found for the plaintiff for the amount claimed by
the particulars. The particulars of the claim alleged, that the plaintiff
sought to recover for damage sustained by the plaintiff by reason of
the negligence of the defendants in not keeping their water-pipes and
the apparatus connected therewith in proper order.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case stated that the defendants were incorporated by stat. 7
Geo. IV., c. cix., for the purpose of supplying Birmingham with water.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the 84th section of their Act it was enacted, that the company
should, upon the laying down of any main-pipe or other pipe in any
street, fix, at the time of laying down such pipe, a proper and sufficient
fire-plug in each such street, and should deliver the key or keys of such
fire-plug to the persons having the care of the engine-house in or near
to the said street, and cause another key to be hung up in the watch-house
in or near to the said street. By sec. 87, pipes were to be eighteen
inches beneath the surface of the soil. By the 89th section, the
mains were at all times to be kept charged with water. The defendants
derived no profit from the maintenance of the plugs distinct from
the general profits of the whole business, but such maintenance was
one of the conditions under which they were permitted to exercise the
privileges given by the Act. The main-pipe opposite the house of the
plaintiff was more than eighteen inches below the surface. The fire-plug
was constructed according to the best known system, and the
materials of it were at the time of the accident sound and in good
order. The apparatus connected with the fire-plug was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The lower part of a wooden plug was inserted in a neck, which projected
above and formed part of the main. About the neck there was
a bed of brickwork puddled in with clay. The plug was also enclosed
in a cast iron tube, which was placed upon and fixed to the brickwork.
The tube was closed at the top by a movable iron stopper having a
hole in it for the insertion of the key, by which the plug was loosened
when occasion required it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plug did not fit tight to the tube, but room was left for it to
move freely. This space was necessarily left for the purpose of easily
and quickly removing the wooden plug to allow the water to flow. On
the removal of the wooden plug the pressure upon the main forced the
water up through the neck and cap to the surface of the street.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>On the 24th of February, a large quantity of water, escaping from
the neck of the main, forced its way through the ground into the plaintiff’s
house. The apparatus had been laid down twenty-five years,
and had worked well during that time. The defendants’ engineer
stated, that the water might have forced its way through the brickwork
round the neck of the main, and that the accident might have
been caused by the frost, inasmuch as the expansion of the water
would force up the plug out of the neck, and the stopper being incrusted
with ice would not suffer the plug to ascend. One of the
severest frosts on record set in on the 15th of January, 1855, and continued
until after the accident in question. An incrustation of ice and
snow had gathered about the stopper, and in the street all round, and
also for some inches between the stopper and the plug. The ice had
been observed on the surface of the ground for a considerable time
before the accident. A short time after the accident, the company’s
turncock removed the ice from the stopper, took out the plug, and
replaced it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge left it to the jury to consider whether the company had
used proper care to prevent the accident. He thought, that, if the
defendants had taken out the ice adhering to the plug, the accident
would not have happened, and left it to the jury to say whether they
ought to have removed the ice. The jury found a verdict for the
plaintiff for the sum claimed.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Field</em>, for the appellant. There was no negligence on the part of the
defendants. The plug was pushed out by the frost, which was one of
the severest ever known.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court then called on</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Kennedy</em>, for the respondent. The company omitted to take sufficient
precautions. The fire-plug is placed in the neck of the main. In
ordinary cases the plug rises and lets the water out; but here there
was an incrustation round the stopper, which prevented the escape
of the water. This might have been easily removed. It will be found,
from the result of the cases, that the company were bound to take
every possible precaution. The fact of premises being fired by sparks
from an engine on a railway is evidence of negligence: Piggott <em>v.</em> Eastern
Counties Railway Company, 3 C. B. 229 (E. C. L. R. vol. 54);
Aldridge <em>v.</em> Great Western Railway Company, 3 M. &amp; Gr. 515 (Id.
42), 4 Scott, N. R. 156, 1 Dowl. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 247, <span class='fss'>S. C.</span> [<span class='sc'>Martin, B.</span> I held,
in a case tried at Liverpool, in 1853, that, if locomotives are sent
through the country emitting sparks, the persons doing so incur all
the responsibilities of insurers; that they were liable for all the consequences.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
I invited counsel to tender a bill of exceptions to that
ruling. Water is a different matter.] It is the defendants’ water,
therefore they are bound to see that no injury is done to any one by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>it. An action has been held to lie for so negligently constructing a
hayrick at the extremity of the owner’s land, that, by reason of its
spontaneous ignition, his neighbor’s house was burnt down: Vaughan
<em>v.</em> Menlove, 3 Bing. N. C. 468 (E. C. L. R. vol. 32). [<span class='sc'>Bramwell, B.</span>
In that case discussions had arisen as to the probability of fire, and
the defendant was repeatedly warned of the danger, and said he would
chance it.] He referred to Wells <em>v.</em> Ody, 1 M. &amp; W. 452. [<span class='sc'>Alderson,
B.</span> Is it an accident which any man could have foreseen?] A
scientific man could have foreseen it. If no eye could have seen what
was going on, the case might have been different; but the company’s
servants could have seen, and actually did see, the ice which had collected
about the plug. It is of the last importance, that these plugs,
which are fire-plugs, should be kept by the company in working order.
The accident cannot be considered as having been caused by the act
of God: Siordet <em>v.</em> Hall, 4 Bing. 607 (Id. 13).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Alderson, B.</span> I am of opinion that there was no evidence to be
left to the jury. The case turns upon the question, whether the facts
proved show that the defendants were guilty of negligence. Negligence
is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided
upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of
human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and
reasonable man would not do.<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a> The defendants might have been
liable for negligence, if, unintentionally, they omitted to do that which
a reasonable person would have done, or did that which a person taking
reasonable precautions would not have done. A reasonable man
would act with reference to the average circumstances of the temperature
in ordinary years. The defendants had provided against such
frosts as experience would have led men, acting prudently, to provide
against; and they are not guilty of negligence, because their precautions
proved insufficient against the effects of the extreme severity of
the frost of 1855, which penetrated to a greater depth than any which
ordinarily occurs south of the polar regions. Such a state of circumstances
constitutes a contingency against which no reasonable man can
provide. The result was an accident for which the defendants cannot
be held liable.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Martin, B.</span> I think that the direction was not correct, and that
there was no evidence for the jury. The defendants are not responsible,
unless there was negligence on their part. To hold otherwise
would be to make the company responsible as insurers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span><span class='sc'>Bramwell, B.</span> The Act of Parliament directed the defendants to
lay down pipes, with plugs in them, as safety-valves, to prevent the
bursting of the pipes. The plugs were properly made, and of proper
material; but there was an accumulation of ice about this plug, which
prevented it from acting properly. The defendants were not bound
to keep the plugs clear. It appears to me that the plaintiff was under
quite as much obligation to remove the ice and snow which had accumulated,
as the defendants. However that may be, it appears to
me that it would be monstrous to hold the defendants responsible
because they did not foresee and prevent an accident, the cause of
which was so obscure, that it was not discovered until many months
after the accident had happened.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>YERKES <em>v.</em> NORTHERN PACIFIC R. CO.<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Wisconsin, November 29, 1901.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 112 Wisconsin Reports, 184.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Dodge, J.</span>... Plaintiff assigns as error the definition of the due
care which plaintiff was bound to exercise to avert the charge of contributory
negligence, viz.:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The plaintiff cannot recover in this case unless you find that he
was in no manner guilty of any want of ordinary care, or such care as
persons of ordinary care ordinarily use, which contributed to his said
injuries.”<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>That this was an incorrect and misleading definition of “ordinary
care” has been declared so often by this court as to make further discussion
unnecessary. The rule has been repeatedly laid down that
due care is to be tested by the surrounding circumstances, and that
no definition is complete or correct which does not embody that element.<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
Ordinary care is the care ordinarily exercised by the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>mass of mankind, or its type, the ordinarily prudent person, under the
same or similar circumstances, and the omission of the last qualification,
“under the same or similar circumstances,” or “under like circumstances,”
is error. Boelter <em>v.</em> Ross L. Co., 103 Wis. 324, 330;
Dehsoy <em>v.</em> Milwaukee E. R. &amp; L. Co., 110 Wis. 412; Warden <em>v.</em> Miller,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 67. The necessity of the omitted qualification to a correct
definition of due care is especially obvious under the circumstances of
this case. What would be the care of an ordinarily prudent person,
standing in safety upon a stationary platform, or even standing upon
the perfect and level footboard of a moving switch engine, would not
be the care to be expected of one attempting to perform the services
of a yard man upon a bent, declining, and defective footboard such
as here presented. The attention of the jury was not called by this
instruction to a very important element which they must consider in
order to decide whether the plaintiff was or was not guilty of contributory
negligence, and the instruction to them on the subject was
therefore misleading and erroneous.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>HILL <em>v.</em> GLENWOOD<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Iowa, July 13, 1904.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 124 Iowa Reports, 479.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Weaver, J.</span><a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a> The plaintiff claims to have been injured upon one of
the public walks in the city of Glenwood, and that such injury was
occasioned by reason of the negligence of the city in the maintenance
of the walk at the place of the accident, and without fault on his own
part contributing thereto. From verdict and judgment in his favor
for $665, the city appeals. In this court the appellant makes no claim
that the city was not negligent, but a reversal is sought on other
grounds.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>It was shown without dispute that plaintiff had been blind for many
years, and this fact is the basis of the criticism upon the charge given
to the jury. In the third paragraph of the charge, the court, defining
negligence, said: “(3) Negligence is defined to be the want of ordinary
care; that is, such care as an ordinary prudent person would
exercise under like circumstances. There is no precise definition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>ordinary care, but it may be said that it is such care as an ordinarily
prudent person would exercise under like circumstances, and should
be proportioned to the danger and peril reasonably to be apprehended
from a lack of proper prudence. This rule applies alike to both parties
to this action, and may be used in determining whether either was
negligent.” In the eighth paragraph, referring to the plaintiff’s duty
to exercise care for his own safety, the following language is used:
“(8) It must also appear from the evidence that the plaintiff did not
in any way contribute to the happening of the accident in question by
any negligence on his part; that is, by his own want of ordinary care.
The plaintiff, on his part, was under obligation to use ordinary care to
prevent injury when passing over any sidewalk; and if he failed so to
do, and his failure in any way contributed to the happening of the
accident in question, then he cannot recover herein. The evidence
shows without dispute that he was blind, and this fact should be considered
by you in determining what ordinary care on his part would
require when he was attempting to pass over one of the sidewalks of
this city.” Counsel for appellant do not deny that the rules here laid
down would be a correct statement of the law of negligence and contributory
negligence as applied to the ordinary case of sidewalk accident,
but it is urged that the conceded fact of plaintiff’s blindness
made it the duty of the court to say to the jury that a blind person who
attempts to use the public street “must exercise a higher degree of
care and caution than a person ordinarily would be expected or required
to use had he full possession of his sense of sight.” We cannot
give this proposition our assent. It is too well established to require
argument or citation of authority that the care which the city is
bound to exercise in the maintenance of its streets is ordinary and
reasonable care, the care which ordinarily marks the conduct of a
person of average prudence and foresight. So, too, it is equally well
settled that the care which a person using the street is bound to exercise
on his own part to discover danger and avoid accident and injury
is of precisely the same character, the ordinary and reasonable care of
a person of average prudence and foresight. The streets are for the
use of the general public without discrimination; for the weak, the
lame, the halt and the blind, as well as for those possessing perfect
health, strength, and vision. The law casts upon one no greater
burden of care than upon the other. It is true, however, that in determining
what is reasonable or ordinary care we must look to the circumstances
and surroundings of each particular case. As said by us in
Graham <em>v.</em> Oxford, 105 Iowa, 708: “There is no fixed rule for determining
what is ordinary care applicable to all cases, but each case
must be determined according to its own facts.” In the case before
us the plaintiff’s blindness is simply one of the facts which the jury
must give consideration, in finding whether he did or did not act with
the care which a reasonably prudent man would ordinarily exercise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>when burdened by such infirmity. In other words, the measures
which a traveler upon the street must employ for his own protection
depend upon the nature and extent of the peril to which he knows, or
in the exercise of reasonable prudence ought to know, he is exposed.
The greater and more imminent the risk, the more he is required to
look out for and guard against injury to himself; but the care thus
exercised is neither more nor less than ordinary care—the care which
men of ordinary prudence and experience may reasonably be expected
to exercise under like circumstances. See cases cited in 21 Am. &amp;
Eng. Enc. Law, (2d ed.) 465, note 1. In the case at bar the plaintiff
was rightfully upon the street, and if he was injured by reason of the
negligence of the city, and without contributory negligence on his
part, he was entitled to a verdict. In determining whether he did
exercise due care it was proper for the jury, as we have already indicated,
to consider his blindness, and in view of that condition, and all
the surrounding facts and circumstances, find whether he exercised ordinary
care and prudence. If he did, he was not guilty of contributory
negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>This view of the law seems to be fairly embodied in the instructions
to which exception is taken. If the appellant believed, as it now
argues, that the charge should have been more specific, and dwelt with
greater emphasis upon the fact of plaintiff’s blindness as an element
for the consideration of the jury in finding whether he exercised reasonable
care, it had the right to ask an instruction framed to meet its
views in that respect. No such request was made, and the omission
of the court to so amplify the charge on its own motion was not error.<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c015'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'>KEITH <em>v.</em> WORCESTER STREET R. Co.<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, November 26, 1907.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 196 Massachusetts Reports, 478.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Two Actions of Tort for personal injuries received by the plaintiff’s
intestate caused by her falling when stepping across street railway
rails which were piled by the defendant street railway company
on the highway next to the curbing, and were allowed by the street
railway company and the defendant town to remain there, and which,
it was alleged, constituted an obstruction of the highway.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c015'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The accident happened in the daytime. The plaintiff’s intestate
was near-sighted, and could not recognize a friend at a distance of
more than ten or twelve feet.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>At the trial in the Superior Court, defendants requested the following
instruction:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the plaintiff’s intestate had defective eyesight, she should take
greater care in walking the street than one of good eyesight; and if
she failed to use this greater degree of care, the verdict must be for the
defendant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This request was refused, subject to exception.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the charge to the jury, the presiding judge stated: “The plaintiff
contends and has got to show by a fair preponderance of the evidence
that Mrs. Keith was injured, and that she was injured while she
was using&#160;... a degree of care that a reasonably prudent and careful
person, acting prudently and carefully at the time, would have
exercised and should have exercised in your judgment under all the
circumstances then surrounding Mrs. Keith. That means not only external
circumstances, that means not only the way in which the rails
were placed, the location of the car, the necessity of action on her
part, but it means also with reference to her personal peculiarities as
they were shown to exist upon the stand. For instance, the conduct
of a perfectly sound and healthy person may be properly regarded as
one thing, when the same conduct on the part of a diseased or infirm
person might be regarded as something very different.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What might be in your judgment perfectly reasonable and proper
and careful on the part of a sound person might be regarded fairly by
you as improper and careless on the part of an infirm person.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, in this case, while I cannot instruct you as a matter of law
that Mrs. Keith, if you find her to be near-sighted, was bound to use a
higher degree of care than a person not near-sighted, I have got to
leave it to you as a matter of fact whether a near-sighted person would
not, in order to be careful, have to exercise a higher degree of care than
a person not near-sighted. In other words, I have got to leave it to
you to determine whether or not a near-sighted person is using due
care if he or she under the particular circumstances acts exactly
as a person who was not near-sighted would have done. In other
words, it is a matter of fact for you to determine whether Mrs.
Keith was called on to do differently from a person in full possession
of eyesight rather than as a matter of law for me to direct you in
regard to it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury found for the plaintiff in both cases.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Rugg, J.</span>... The defendant asked the court to rule that if the
person injured “had defective eyesight, she should take greater care
in walking the street than one of good sight, and if she failed to use
this greater degree of care the verdict must be for the defendant.”
This request properly was refused, for the reason that it directed a
verdict upon a single phase of the testimony, which was not necessarily
decisive. In this respect the prayer differs vitally from the one
which in Winn <em>v.</em> Lowell, 1 Allen, 177, this court held should have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>given.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c015'><sup>[67]</sup></a> We see no reason for modifying the decision in Winn <em>v.</em> Lowell,
nor is it inconsistent with subsequent cases. The standard of care
established by the law is what the ordinarily prudent and cautious
person would do to protect himself under given conditions. There is
no higher or different standard for one who is aged, feeble, blind, halt,
deaf or otherwise impaired in capacity, than for one in perfect physical
condition. It has frequently, in recent as well as earlier cases, been
said, in referring to one under some impediment, that greater caution
or increased circumspection may be required in view of these adverse
conditions. See, for example, Winn <em>v.</em> Lowell, 1 Allen, 177; Hall <em>v.</em>
West End Street Railway, 168 Mass. 461; Hilborn <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Northern
Street Railway, 191 Mass. 14; Vecchioni <em>v.</em> New York Central &amp;

Railway, 192 Mass. 324; Hamilton <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway,
193 Mass. 324. These expressions mean nothing more than that
a person so afflicted must put forth a greater degree of effort than one
not acting under any disabilities, in order to attain that standard of
care which the law has established for everybody. When looked at
from one standpoint, it is incorrect to say that a blind person must
exercise a higher degree of care than one whose sight is perfect, but in
another aspect, a blind person may be obliged to take precautions,
practice vigilance and sharpen other senses, unnecessary for one of
clear vision, in order to attain that degree of care which the law requires.
It may depend in some slight degree upon how the description
of duty begins, where the emphasis may fall at a given moment, but
when the whole proposition is stated, the rights of the parties are as
fully protected in the one way as in the other. It is perhaps more
logical to say that the plaintiff is bound to use ordinary care, and that
in passing upon what ordinary care demands, due consideration should
be given to blindness or other infirmities. This was the course pursued
by the Superior Court. Neff <em>v.</em> Wellesley, 148 Mass. 487. Smith
<em>v.</em> Wildes, 143 Mass. 556. But it is also correct to say that in the
exercise of common prudence one of defective eyesight must usually as
matter of general knowledge take more care and employ keener
watchfulness in walking upon the streets and avoiding obstructions
than the same person with good eyesight, in order to reach the standard
established by the law for all persons alike, whether they be weak
or strong, sound or deficient.</p>

  <h5 class='c013'>MEREDITH <em>v.</em> REED<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Indiana, May Term, 1866.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 26 Indiana Reports, 334.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Gregory, C. J.</span> Meredith sued Reed before a justice for an injury
done by a stallion of the latter to the mare of the former, resulting in
the death of the mare. Jury trial, verdict for the defendant; motion
for a new trial overruled and judgment. The evidence is in the record.
The facts are substantially as follows: In May, 1865, the defendant
owned a stallion, which had previously been let to mares, but owing
to the sickness of the owner, was not so let during the spring of 1865.
He was a gentle stallion, and had never been known by the owner to
be guilty of any vicious acts. Not being in use, he had been kept up
in a stable for four or five months. He was secured in the stable by a
strong halter and chain fastened through an iron ring in the manger.
The stable door was securely fastened on the inside by a strong iron
hasp, passed over a staple, and a piece of chain passed two or three
times through the staple over the hasp, and the ends firmly tied together
with a strong cord. It was also fastened on the outside by a
piece of timber, one end of which was planted in the ground, while
the other rested against the door. The horse was thus secured on the
day and night the injury occurred. The gate of the enclosure surrounding
the stable was shut and fastened as usual. About 11 o’clock
that night the horse was found loose on the highway, and did the
injury complained of. Early the following morning the outside gate
was found open; the stable door was found open, with the log prop
lying some distance to one side, and the chain which had been passed
through the staple was gone, and the cord with which it had been tied
was found cut and the pieces lying on the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are forty-two alleged errors assigned, but many of them are
not, in our opinion, so presented as to entitle them to consideration in
this Court. So far as the substantial rights of the appellant are involved,
all the questions properly presented resolve themselves into
the inquiry as to the nature and extent of the liability of the owner of
a domestic animal for injuries done by it to the personal property of
another, disconnected from any trespass to real estate.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is contended, on the one hand, that ordinary care was all the law
required of the defendant in this case. On the other it is claimed that
the utmost care was necessary to free him from liability. Ordinary
care is all that the law required in the case in judgment. What is ordinary
care in some cases would be carelessness in others. The law regards
the circumstances surrounding each case, and the nature of the
animal or machinery under control. Greater care is required to be
taken of a stallion than of a mare; so in the management of a steam-engine,
greater care is necessary than in the use of a plow. Yet it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>all ordinary care; such care as a prudent, careful man would take
under like circumstances. The degree of care is always in proportion
to the danger to be apprehended. The case at bar was properly sent to
the jury, and the verdict is fully sustained by the evidence.</p>

<p class='c014'>Action for damage caused to plaintiff, while passing along a public
alley, by his coming in contact with one of defendants’ wires heavily
charged with electricity, which had become detached from its overhead
fastening, and was hanging down to within about two feet of the
ground. At the trial there was some evidence tending to show that
the position of the wire was due to the negligence of the defendants.
Verdict for plaintiff, and judgment thereon. Defendant appealed;
alleging as one ground the giving of certain instructions as to the care
required by defendant. Those instructions are stated in the opinion.<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c015'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Campbell, J.</span>... This court does not recognize any degrees of
negligence, such as slight or gross, and logically it ought not to recognize
any degrees in its antithesis, care.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c015'><sup>[70]</sup></a> The court instructed the jury
in this case that the defendant was not an insurer of the safety of
plaintiff, but that in constructing its line and maintaining the same
in repair, it was held to the utmost degree of care and diligence; that
in this respect it is bound to the highest degree of care, skill, and diligence
in the construction and maintenance of its lines of wire and
other appurtenances, and in carrying on its business, so as to make
the same safe against accidents so far as such safety can, by the use
of such care and diligence, be secured. If it observed such degree of
care, it was not liable; if it failed therein, it was liable for injuries
caused thereby.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think the court was unfortunate in attempting to draw any distinctions
in the degrees of care or negligence. It would have been
safer and the better practice to instruct the jury,—which ought hereafter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>to be observed,—even in cases like the one before us, that the
defendant was bound to exercise that reasonable care and caution
which would be exercised by a reasonably prudent and cautious person
under the same or similar circumstances. In addition to this, the jury
should have been instructed that the care increases as the danger does,
and that where the business in question is attended with great peril
to the public, the care to be exercised by the person conducting the
business is commensurate with the increased danger. But, in effect,
this is what the court did. Under the facts of the case, the law required
of the defendant conducting, as it did, a business so dangerous
to the public, the highest degree of care which skill and foresight can
attain consistent with the practical conduct of its business under the
known methods and the present state of the particular art. This is
the measure of the duty owed by a common carrier to a passenger for
hire. Thompson’s Carriers of Passengers, p. 208, and cases cited.
Not for the same reason, or because the doctrine rests upon the same
principle, but with even greater force should this rule apply to a person
or corporation engaged in the equally, if not more, dangerous business
of distributing electricity throughout a city by means of wires
strung over the public alleys and streets, in so far as concerned its
duty to the travelling public.</p>

<p class='c007'>In those courts where degrees of negligence are not countenanced,
nevertheless, in cases where the duty of a common carrier of passengers
is laid down, the jury are told that carriers are bound to the
utmost degree of care which human foresight can attain. This is upon
the theory that reasonable or ordinary care in a case of that kind is the
highest care which human ingenuity can practically exercise, and
that, as a matter of law, courts will hold every reasonably prudent and
careful man to the exercise of the utmost care and diligence in protecting
the public from the dangers necessarily incident to the carrying
on of a hazardous business.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the facts of a case naturally lead equally intelligent persons
honestly to entertain different views as to the degree of care resting
upon a defendant, the court ought not to lay down a rule prescribing
any particular or specific degree in that case. But where all minds
concur—as they must in a case like the one we are now considering—in
regarding the carrying on of a business as fraught with peril
to the public inherent in the nature of the business itself, the court
makes no mistake in defining the duty of those conducting it as the
exercise of the utmost care. It was, therefore, not prejudicial error
for the court to tell the jury in this case what the law requires of the
defendant, viz., the highest degree of care in conducting its business.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Gillett, J.</span> Complaint by appellee to recover damages for loss of
property by fire, by reason of the alleged negligence of appellant.
There was a verdict and judgment in favor of appellee.<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c015'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>Appellant complains of appellee’s instructions five and six, which
were given by the court in the order indicated by their numbers. They
are as follows: “(5) It is the duty of a railroad to use all reasonable
precaution in running and operating its trains, and in providing its
engines with proper spark-arresters, so as to prevent injury to the
property of others by sparks or fire emitted or thrown therefrom.
(6) If you believe from all of the evidence and circumstances in the
case that at the time and prior to the destruction of the property of
the plaintiff, as alleged in his complaint, there were a number of
wooden buildings and structures standing on either side of the defendant’s
track and in close proximity thereto, including the barn or stable
of said Melissa McFall in the town of Hobbs, and at such time it was,
and for some time prior thereto it had been, unusually dry, thereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>rendering such wood buildings and structures, including the barn or
stable of said Melissa McFall, and also the property of the plaintiff
herein, unusually dry, inflammable, and easily set on fire by sparks
and coals of fire emitted from defendant’s engines in passing through
said town, and that there was also at the time, and for several hours
prior thereto had been, a strong wind blowing continuously across the
defendant’s track, in the direction of the barn or stable of said Melissa
McFall, and the wooden buildings and structures near the defendant’s
track, including the property of the plaintiff herein, which greatly and
unusually increased the danger and risk of setting fire to such buildings
by sparks and coals of fire emitted or thrown from its engine in passing
through said town, over ordinary times and conditions, and all
of which facts and conditions the defendant knew at the time, the defendant,
under such circumstances, would be required to use a greater
degree of care in operating and running its engines through said town
to prevent injury to such buildings or property by sparks or coals of
fire emitted or thrown from its engine, than it would at ordinary times
and under ordinary conditions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Assuming, without deciding, that it was not error for the court, in
its fifth instruction, to use the term “reasonable precaution,” instead
of the preferable one, “ordinary care,”<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c015'><sup>[73]</sup></a> and assuming further, since
the care that the company was required to exercise was, so far as the
element of law was concerned, to be measured by a fixed standard,
which was to be fully complied with (Wharton, Negligence [2d ed.],
§ 46), that it was proper to use the expression “all reasonable precaution,”
the question arises whether it is not likely that the jury was
misled by the charge in the next instruction that in the circumstances
therein hypothetically stated “a greater degree of care” was required
than in ordinary conditions. The sixth instruction would have been
proper, had the court charged, after stating to the jury hypothetically
the conditions which existed, leaving it to them to determine whether
the danger was increased, that, in the event they so found, it was their
duty, in determining whether reasonable or ordinary care had been
exercised, to consider the increased danger of fire, yet we cannot say
that this was the fair meaning of the words in which said instruction
was couched.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has been much discussion in the books concerning the correctness
of the old doctrine as to degrees of negligence. New York
Central R. Co. <em>v.</em> Lockwood, (1873) 17 Wall. 357, 21 L. Ed. 627;
Steamboat New World <em>v.</em> King, (1853) 16 How. 469, 14 L. Ed. 1019;
Ohio, etc., R. Co. <em>v.</em> Selby, (1874) 47 Ind. 471, 17 Am. Rep. 719;
Pennsylvania Co. <em>v.</em> Sinclair, (1878) 62 Ind. 301, 30 Am. Rep. 185;
Wharton, Negligence (2d ed.), § 44; 6 Albany L. J. 313; 2 Ames &amp;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Smith, Cases on Torts, 143; 21 Am. and Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.),
459, and cases cited. While we apprehend that the adverse opinions
which have been expressed concerning such doctrine were not intended
to be understood as militating against the view that the legal standard
of care is not the same in all relations, or to discountenance the practice
of charging the jury in terms that indicate the extent of care
required, as great, ordinary, or slight (1 Shearman &amp; Redfield, Negligence
[5th ed.], § 47), yet the point which we wish to enforce now is that
in all cases negligence consists simply in a failure to measure up to the
legal standard of care. It was said by Willes, J., in Grill <em>v.</em> General
Iron Screw, etc., Co., (1866) L. R. 1 C. P. 600, 611: “Confusion has
arisen from regarding negligence as a positive instead of a negative
word. It is really the absence of such care as it was the duty of the
defendant to use.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here we admittedly have a case in which it was the duty of the
company to exercise ordinary care, but what does an instruction mean
that informs the jury that in certain circumstances a greater degree
of care is required, when it has for a background an instruction, which
is applicable to all circumstances, that all reasonable precaution must
be used? We think that in such a case the jury would understand that
more than ordinary care was required, and it is not improbable that
the effect of giving such an instruction, following an instruction like
5, would be to lead the jury to infer that the defendant’s duty was
raised by the circumstances recited to a pitch of intensity that could
not reasonably have been attained.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was said by this court in Meredith <em>v.</em> Reed, (1866) 26 Ind. 334,
337: “What is ordinary care in some cases, would be carelessness in
others. The law regards the circumstances surrounding each case, and
the nature of the animal or machinery under control. Greater care is
required to be taken of a stallion than of a mare; so in the management
of a steam engine, greater care is necessary than in the use of a
plough. Yet it is all ordinary care.” The legal standard of care required
in a particular relationship is always the same, although the
amount of care thus required depends upon the particular circumstances.
Cleveland, etc., R. Co. <em>v.</em> Terry, (1858) 8 Ohio St. 570;
Weiser <em>v.</em> Broadway, etc., St. R. Co., (1895) 6 Ohio Dec. 215. As has
been observed by a modern writer: “This standard may vary in fact,
but not in law.” 2 Jaggard, Torts, p. 819. In an article in 3 [6] Albany,
L. J. 314, it is said: “The ratio, proportion or correspondence
of diligence to circumstances, of care to surroundings, is fixed and
identical. And, in determining a question of diligence or negligence in
either case [as between two cases previously used by way of illustration],
it would be only necessary to apply the same rule to varying
circumstances and persons, to demand the same ratio between varying
extremes. And it is not too much to assert that all the perplexity
and misunderstanding on the subject of diligence and negligence are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>due to the habit of confounding the specific acts and circumstances,
which must always vary, with the ratio or relation between them,
which remains always the same.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 13 Am. and Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.), 416, it is said: “The very
statement of the general rule that reasonable care is required to prevent
injuries to others from fire, implies that what is reasonable care
must depend upon the circumstances of each particular case. It is,
however, inaccurate to say, as many of the cases do, that the degree of
care varies with the particular circumstances. It is only reasonable
care that is required in any case; but the greater the danger, or the
more likely the communication of fire and the ignition of the property
of others, the more precautions and the closer vigilance reasonable
care requires.” As above suggested, cases can be found in which it is
stated that the degree of care to be used depends upon the danger, but,
as has been observed by this court, it is not every statement of the law
as found in an opinion or text-book, however well and accurately put,
which can properly be embodied in an instruction. Garfield <em>v.</em> State,
(1881) 74 Ind. 60. The viciousness of the instruction in question lies
in its tendency to lead the jury to infer that the legal standard of
ordinary care was raised by the circumstances recited, thus making
possible the inference that a great but undefined extent of care was
required, whereas all that the law exacted was the ordinary care which
the situation demanded, or such care as it is to be assumed that an
ordinarily prudent man would exercise in the circumstances, were the
risk his own.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c015'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In this case the acts and omissions which the complaint charged as
negligent were various, so that the question of what was ordinary care
arose in a number of ways, and we can only conclude, in view of the
misleading character of the instruction under consideration, that
prejudicial error has intervened.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Assumpsit for negligence in losing 764½ doubloons, intrusted to
the defendant to be carried from New York to Boston, as a gratuitous
bailee. The gold was put up in two distinct bags, one within the
other, and at the trial, upon the general issue, it appeared that the defendant,
who was a money broker, brought them on board of the
steamboat bound from New York to Providence; that in the morning
while the steamboat lay at New York, and a short time before sailing,
one of the bags was discovered to be lost, and that the other bag was
left by the defendant on a table in his valise in the cabin, for a few moments
only, while he went on deck to send information of the supposed
loss to the plaintiffs, there being then a large number of passengers on
board, and the loss being publicly known among them. On the defendant’s
return the second bag was also missing and after every
search no trace of the manner of the loss could be ascertained. The
valise containing both bags was brought on board by the defendant on
the preceding evening, and put by him in a berth in the forward cabin.
He left it there all night, having gone in the evening to the theatre,
and on his return having slept in the middle cabin. The defendant
had his own money to a considerable amount in the same valise.
There was evidence to show that he made inquiries on board, if the
valise would be safe, and that he was informed, that if it contained
articles of value, it had better be put into the custody of the captain’s
clerk in the bar, under lock and key. There were many other circumstances
in the case. The argument at the trial turned wholly on the
question of gross negligence, and all the facts were fully commented
on by counsel. But as the case is intended only to present the discussion
on the question of law, it is not thought necessary to recapitulate
them.<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c015'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Story, J.</span>, after summing up the facts, said, I agree to the law as
laid down at the bar, that in cases of bailees without reward, they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>liable only for gross negligence. Such are depositaries, or persons receiving
deposits without reward for their care; and mandataries, or
persons receiving goods to carry from one place to another without
reward. The latter is the predicament of the defendant. He undertook
to carry the gold in question for the plaintiff, gratuitously, from
New York to Providence, and he is not responsible unless he has been
guilty of gross negligence. Nothing in this case arises out of the personal
character of the defendant, as broker. He is not shown to be
either more or less negligent than brokers generally are; nor if he was,
is that fact brought home to the knowledge of the plaintiffs. They
confided the money to him as a broker of ordinary diligence and care,
having no other knowledge of him; and, therefore, no question arises
as to what would have been the case, if the plaintiffs had known him
to be a very careless or a very attentive man. Jones’ Bail. 46. The
language of the books, as to what constitutes gross negligence, or not,
is sometimes loose and inaccurate from the general manner in which
propositions are stated. When it is said, that gross negligence is equivalent
to fraud, it is not meant that it cannot exist without fraud.
There may be very gross negligence in cases where there is no pretence
that the party has been guilty of fraud, though certainly such negligence
is often presumptive of fraud. In determining what is gross
negligence, we must take into consideration what is the nature of the
thing bailed. If it be of little value, less care is required than if it be
of great value. If a bag of apples were left in a street for a short time,
without a person to guard it, it would certainly not be more than
ordinary neglect. But if the bag were of jewels or gold, such conduct
would be gross negligence. In short, care and diligence are to be proportional
to the value of the goods, the temptation and facility of
stealing them, and the danger of losing them. So Sir William Jones
lays down the law. “Diamonds, gold, and precious trinkets,” says
he, “ought from their nature to be kept with peculiar care, under lock
and key; it would, therefore, be gross negligence in a depositary to
leave such deposit in an open antechamber; and <em>ordinary</em> neglect, at
least, to let them remain on the table, where they might possibly tempt
his servants.” Jones’ Bail. 38, 46, 62. So in Smith <em>v.</em> Horne, 2
Moore’s R. 18, it was held to be gross negligence in the case of a carrier,
under the usual notice of not being responsible for goods above
£5 in value, to send goods in a cart with one man, when two were
usually sent to see to the delivery of them. So in Booth <em>v.</em> Wilson, 1
Barn. &amp; Ald. 59, it was held gross negligence in a gratuitous bailee to
put a horse into a dangerous pasture. In Batson <em>v.</em> Donovan, 4 Barn.
&amp; Ald. 21, the general doctrine was admitted in the fullest terms. It
appears to me that the true way of considering cases of this nature is,
to consider whether the party has omitted that care which bailees,
without hire, or mandataries of ordinary prudence usually take of
property of this nature. If he has, then it constitutes a case of gross
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>negligence. The question is not whether he has omitted that care,
which very prudent persons usually take of their own property, for the
omission of that would be but slight negligence; nor whether he has
omitted that care which prudent persons ordinarily take of their own
property, for that would be but ordinary negligence: but whether there
be a want of that care, which men of common sense, however inattentive,
usually take, or ought to be presumed to take of their property,
for that is gross negligence. The contract of bailees without reward
is not merely for good faith, but for such care as persons of common
prudence in their situation usually bestow upon such property. If
they omit such care, it is gross negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The present is a case of a mandatary of money. Such property is
by all persons, negligent as well as prudent, guarded with much greater
care than common property. The defendant is a broker, accustomed
to the use and transportation of money, and it must be presumed he is
a person of ordinary diligence. He kept his own money in the same
valise; and took no better care of it than of the plaintiff’s. Still if the
jury are of opinion that he omitted to take that reasonable care of the
gold which bailees without reward in his situation usually take, or
which he himself usually took of such property, under such circumstances,
he has been guilty of gross negligence.</p>

more than one of the remedies given by the provisions of this section.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial the plaintiff requested the following rulings:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“6. When the duty of exercising the highest degree of care is incumbent
upon the defendant, any failure upon the part of its servants
to exercise that degree of care is gross negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“7. The term ‘gross’ in the allegation gross negligence, when used
with reference to the degree of care required and not fulfilled, is merely
an expletive, when the degree of care required is the very highest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“8. There are no degrees of negligence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff excepted to the refusal of the judge to give the rulings
requested, and to such parts of the charge as were in conflict with
them. The defendant had a verdict, and the case is here on these
exceptions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Loring, J.</span>... The judge was right in refusing to give the sixth
ruling asked for. A failure to exercise the highest degree of care is
slight negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The seventh ruling requested was wrong. The term “gross negligence”
in a case where the degree of care due is the highest degree
of care means that there has been a gross failure to exercise that degree
of care.<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c015'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Error to Circuit Court of Cuyahoga County.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff below, John Corrigan, an infant under the age of
fourteen, by his guardian, sued the Rolling Mill Company for damages
suffered while in the defendants’ employ, and which he alleged
were caused by their negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer of the defendants alleged, among other defences, that
the injury occurred solely through the plaintiff’s fault.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to this ground of defence, the Court instructed the jury in part
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the duty of the plaintiff to use ordinary care and prudence;
just such care and prudence as a boy of his age, of ordinary care and
prudence, would use under like or similar circumstances. You should
take into consideration his age, the judgment and knowledge he
possessed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Company filed its petition in error.<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c015'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Williams, J.</span> The only questions presented in this case are those
arising upon the special instructions given by the Court in response
to the request of the jury. These instructions, the plaintiff in error
contends, are erroneous in their entirety and in detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. First, it is claimed that the Court erred in the statement of the
plaintiff’s duty, in the opening proposition of the charge, wherein the
jury were instructed that “it was the duty of the plaintiff to use
ordinary care,” which the Court defined to be “just such care as boys
of that age, of ordinary care and prudence, would use under like circumstances,”
and that the jury “should take into consideration the
age of the plaintiff, and the judgment and knowledge he possessed.”
We have found no decision of this Court upon the subject of the contributory
negligence of infants, or the measure of care required of
them. Elsewhere the decisions are conflicting. Each of three different
rules on the subject has found judicial sanction. One rule requires
of children the same standard of care, judgment, and discretion, in anticipating
and avoiding injury, as adults are bound to exercise.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c015'><sup>[83]</sup></a> Another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>wholly exempts small children from the doctrine of contributory
negligence. Between these extremes a third and more reasonable rule
has grown into favor, and is now supported by the great weight of
authority, which is, that a child is held to no greater care than is usually
possessed by children of the same age. Authors and judges,
however, do not always employ the same language in giving expression
to the rule. In Beach on Contributory Negligence, sec. 46, it is thus
expressed: “An infant plaintiff who, on the one hand, is not so young
as to escape entirely all legal accountability, and on the other hand is
not so mature as to be held to the responsibility of an adult is, of
course, in cases involving the question of negligence, to be held responsible
for ordinary care, and ordinary care must mean, in this
connection, that degree of care and prudence which may reasonably
be expected of a child.” The decisions enforcing this rule, that children
are to be held responsible only for such degree of care and prudence
as may reasonably be expected of them, taking due account of
their age and the particular circumstances, are very numerous. “It
is well settled,” says Mr. Justice Hunt in Railroad Company <em>v.</em> Stout,
17 Wall. 657, “that the conduct of an infant of tender years is not to
be judged by the same rule which governs that of an adult.... The
care and caution required of a child is according to his maturity and
capacity only, and this is to be determined in each case by the circumstances
of that case.” In Shearman &amp; Redfield on Negligence, sec. 73,
it is said to be “now settled by the overwhelming weight of authority
that a child is held, as far as he is personally concerned, only to the
exercise of such care and discretion as is reasonably to be expected
from children of his own age.” Another author says, “A child is only
bound to exercise such a degree of care as children of his particular
age may be presumed capable of exercising.” Whittaker’s Smith on
Neg., 411.</p>

<p class='c007'>This rule appears to rest upon sound reason as well as authority.
To constitute contributory negligence in any case there must be a
want of ordinary care and a proximate connection between such want
of care and the injury complained of; and ordinary care is that degree
of care which persons of ordinary care and prudence are accustomed
to use under similar circumstances. Children constitute a class
of persons of less discretion and judgment than adults, of which all
reasonably informed men are aware. Hence ordinarily prudent men
reasonably expect that children will exercise only the care and prudence
of children, and no greater degree of care should be required of
them than is usual under the circumstances among careful and prudent
persons of the class to which they belong. We think it a sound
rule, therefore, that in the application of the doctrine of contributory
negligence to children, in actions by them or in their behalf for injuries
occasioned by the negligence of others, their conduct should not be
judged by the same rule which governs that of adults, and while it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>their duty to exercise ordinary care to avoid the injuries of which they
complain, ordinary care for them is that degree of care which children
of the same age, of ordinary care and prudence, are accustomed to
exercise under similar circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>That portion of the charge of the Court under discussion is in substantial
conformity to this conclusion. The care and prudence which
a boy of the plaintiff’s age of ordinary care and prudence “would use
under like and similar circumstances,” as expressed in the charge, is
such care as “is reasonably to be expected from a boy of his age,” or
“which boys of his age usually exercise,” as the books express it. No
different effect is given to the charge of which the plaintiff in error
can complain, by the direction to the jury to take into consideration
the age of the boy “and the judgment and knowledge he possessed.”
This did not diminish the degree of care required by the previous
portion of the instruction.</p>

<p class='c014'>Appeal from judgment of the General Term of the Supreme Court
in the first judicial department, entered upon an order made October
26, 1887, which affirmed a judgment in favor of defendant, entered
upon an order nonsuiting plaintiff on trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was an action to recover damages for the alleged negligence in
causing the death of plaintiff’s intestate, a child of seven years and
three or four months old.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts, so far as material, are stated in the opinion.<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c015'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span><span class='sc'>Andrews, J.</span> The nonsuit was placed on the ground that an infant
seven years of age was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</span></i>, and that the act of the child in crossing
the street in front of the approaching car was negligence on her
part, which contributed to her death, and barred a recovery. We
think the case should have been submitted to the jury.</p>

<p class='c007'>The negligence of the driver of the car is conceded. His conduct
in driving rapidly along Canal Street at its intersection with Orchard
Street, without looking ahead, but with his eyes turned to the inside
of the car, was grossly negligent. Mangam <em>v.</em> Brooklyn R. R. Co.,
38 N. Y. 455; Railroad Co. <em>v.</em> Gladmon, 15 Wall. 401. It cannot be
asserted as a proposition of law that a child just passed seven years
of age is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</span></i>, so as to be chargeable with negligence. The law
does not define when a child becomes <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</span></i>. Kunz <em>v.</em> City of Troy,
104 N. Y. 344. Infants under seven years of age are deemed incapable
of committing crime, and by the common law such incapacity
presumptively continues until the age of fourteen. An infant between
those ages was regarded as within the age of possible discretion, but
on a criminal charge against an infant between those years the burden
was upon the prosecutor to show that the defendant had intelligence
and maturity of judgment sufficient to render him capable of harboring
a criminal intent. 1 Arch. 11. The Penal Code preserves the rule
of the common law except that it fixes the age of twelve instead of
fourteen as the time when the presumption of incapacity ceases. Penal
Code, §§ 18, 19.</p>

<p class='c007'>In administering civil remedies the law does not fix any arbitrary
period when an infant is deemed capable of exercising judgment and
discretion. It has been said in one case that an infant three or four
years of age could not be regarded as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</span></i>, and the same was said
in another case of an infant five years of age. Mangam <em>v.</em> Brooklyn
R. R., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>; Fallon <em>v.</em> Central Park, N. &amp; E. R. R. R. Co., 64 N. Y.
13. On the other hand, it was said in Cosgrove <em>v.</em> Ogden, 49 N. Y.
255, that a lad six years of age could not be assumed to be incapable
of protecting himself from danger in streets or roads, and in another
case that a boy of eleven years of age was competent to be trusted in
the streets of a city. McMahon <em>v.</em> Mayor, &amp;c., 33 N. Y. 642. From
the nature of the case it is impossible to prescribe a fixed period when
a child becomes <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</span></i>. Some children reach the point earlier than
others. It depends upon many things, such as natural capacity, physical
conditions, training, habits of life, and surroundings. These and
other circumstances may enter into the question. It becomes, therefore,
a question of fact for the jury where the inquiry is material
unless the child is of so very tender years that the Court can safely
decide the fact. The trial Court misapprehended the case of Wendell
<em>v.</em> New York Central Railroad Company, 91 N. Y. 420, in supposing
that it decided, as a proposition of law, that a child of seven years was
capable of exercising judgment so as to be chargeable with contributory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>negligence. It was assumed in that case, both on the trial and on
appeal, that the child whose conduct was in question was capable of
understanding, and did understand the peril of the situation, and
the evidence placed it beyond doubt that he recklessly encountered
the danger which resulted in his death. The boy was familiar with
the crossing, and, eluding the flagman who tried to bar his way, attempted
to run across the track in front of an approaching train in
plain sight, and unfortunately slipped and fell, and was run over and
killed. It appeared that he was a bright, active boy, accustomed to go
to school and on errands alone, and sometimes was intrusted with the
duty of driving a horse and wagon, and that on previous occasions he
had been stopped by the flagman while attempting to cross the track
in front of an approaching train, and had been warned of the danger.
The Court held, upon this state of facts, that the boy was guilty of
culpable negligence. But the case does not decide, as matter of law,
that all children of the age of seven years are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are inclined to the opinion that in an action for an injury to a
child of tender years, based on negligence, who may or may not have
been <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</span></i> when the injury happened, and the fact is material as
bearing upon the question of contributory negligence, the burden is
upon the plaintiff to give some evidence that the party injured was not
capable, as matter of fact, of exercising judgment and discretion.
This rule would seem to be consistent with the principle now well
settled in this State, that in an action for a personal injury, based on
negligence, freedom from contributory negligence on the part of the
party injured is an element of the cause of action. In the present
case the only fact before the jury bearing upon the capacity of the
child whose death was in question was that she was a girl seven years
and three months old. This, we think, did not alone justify an inference
that the child was incapable of exercising any degree of care. But,
assuming that the child was chargeable with the exercise of some degree
of care, we think it should have been left to the jury to determine
whether she acted with that degree of prudence which might reasonably
be expected, under the circumstances, of a child of her years.
This measure of care is all that the law exacts in such a case. Thurber

  <h5 class='c013'>ILLINOIS IRON AND METAL COMPANY <em>v.</em> WEBER<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Illinois, April 16, 1902.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 196 Illinois Reports, 526.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Appeal by original defendants from the decision of the Appellate
Court for the First District; 89 Ill. App. 368.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plaintiff was a newsboy, between eleven and twelve years old, and
his stand was at Dearborn and Monroe streets in the city of Chicago.
He was going from his home, about four miles distant, to his place of
business. By permission of the driver, he got on a wagon loaded with
brick. He stood up on the rear of the wagon behind the box, and held
on to the hind end-gate of the wagon. The wagon was one of a procession
of loaded teams in a street-car track. The next wagon behind
was owned by defendant. The end of the pole of defendant’s wagon
struck the plaintiff’s leg, inflicting a serious wound. Plaintiff had
been in the paper business since he was nine years old, and had been
in the habit of riding down town on wagons.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Under instructions, the substance of which is stated in the opinion,
the jury found a verdict for plaintiff.<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c015'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cartwright, J.</span>... The first two instructions each directed the
jury to find the defendant guilty, provided they should believe, from
the evidence, the existence of certain facts. One of the essential facts
which the law required to be found was that the plaintiff was in the
exercise of ordinary care for his own safety, and each of those instructions
informed the jury that the fact was proved if he was in the exercise
of ordinary care for a boy of his age. They directed the jury to
return a verdict for the plaintiff if they found he was in the exercise of
ordinary care for a boy of his age and the defendant was negligent and
the injury resulted. That was not a correct rule of law, since the question
of care was not to be determined alone by the plaintiff’s age, but
also from his intelligence, experience, and ability to understand and
comprehend dangers and care for himself. The case was one in which
the defendant was entitled to correct instructions upon that question.
It was a question whether plaintiff was not guilty of negligence in
riding where he did, in a procession of teams, outside of the box, behind
the end-gate of the wagon. The position was a dangerous one,
not provided or used for passengers or intended for such use. Plaintiff
had a right to ride on the wagon with the driver’s consent, but it
was his duty to use reasonable care for his own safety. There was a
string of heavily loaded teams in the car tracks, where it was difficult,
if not impossible, to turn out, and the difficulty and danger in stopping
when one of a procession stops is matter of common knowledge. Cases
cited as to the liability of common carriers of passengers where a car
is full and a passenger rides upon the platform have no bearing on
this question. Passengers are accustomed to be upon platforms and
are sometimes compelled to ride there, and different rules are applied
to a common carrier from those governing parties not in that relation.
There was no necessity whatever for the plaintiff assuming the position
that he did. These facts were not controverted or in dispute, but
are gathered from his own testimony. If the damage to the plaintiff
was caused by his own negligence in assuming such a position, he
could not recover. In determining that question his age was to be
taken into account, but it could not be said, as a matter of law, that
he was too young to exercise any care for his personal safety or that
he was incapable of negligence. Unquestionably, he was capable of
exercising some degree of judgment and discretion and some degree of
care for his own safety. He had lived in the city and had been engaged
in business, and was accustomed to ride on wagons. Judge Thompson,
in his Commentaries on Law of Negligence (vol. I, sect. 309),
says: “Two lads of equal age and natural capacity, one of them
raised in the country and the other in the city, might approach a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>given danger, and the one would be perfectly competent to care for
himself while the other would be helpless in the face of it. Therefore,
the capacity, the intelligence, the knowledge, the experience, and the
discretion of the child are always evidentiary circumstances,—circumstances
with reference to which each party has the right to introduce
evidence, which evidence is to be considered by the jury.” The
rule established by our own decisions is, that age is not the only element
to be considered, but that intelligence, capacity, and experience
are also to be taken into account. Weick <em>v.</em> Lander, 75 Ill. 93; City
of Chicago <em>v.</em> Keefe, 114 Id. 222; Illinois Central Railroad Company

<p class='c014'>This was an action of trespass, assault, and battery.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1816, the defendant, then being about twelve years of age, shooting
an arrow from a bow, struck the plaintiff and put out one of his
eyes, the plaintiff being then between nine and ten years of age. The
plaintiff and defendant were schoolmates. The boys attending the
school were assembled near the school-house. One of them had a bow
and arrow, with which he and the defendant had been shooting at a
mark. Some remark was made by the plaintiff, when the defendant
said, “I will shoot you,” and took the bow and arrow from another
boy who then held it. The plaintiff ran into the school-house and hid
behind a fire-board standing before the fire-place in the school-room.
The defendant followed to the door of the school-room, and saying,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“See me shoot that basket,” discharged the arrow. At that moment
the plaintiff raised his head above the fire-board, and the arrow struck
him. There was a basket standing on a desk in the direction that the
arrow was aimed. When the arrow was shot, there were a number of
boys in the school-room. There had been no quarrel between the boys.
The plaintiff, however, on entering the school-house was frightened,
and said he was afraid he would be shot. The plaintiff suffered great
pain for two months, became blind of one eye, and for five years was
disabled from attending school in consequence of the weakness of sight
of the other eye. His mother became a widow; and when the plaintiff
was able to attend school, her poverty prevented his receiving an
ordinary education. This suit was commenced in 1827, within a year
after the plaintiff attained his age.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge charged the jury that the shooting the arrow in the
school-room where there were a number of boys assembled was an
unlawful act; that it appeared to him to have been, at the least,
grossly negligent and unjustifiable; and that, if the jury thought so,
they ought to find a verdict for the plaintiff, with damages. The
defendant excepted. The jury found for the plaintiff, with $180
damages, and a motion was now made to set aside the verdict.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>By the Court, Marcy, J.</span> It is not, I apprehend, necessary for us
to say whether the judge erred or not in his remark to the jury that,
under the circumstances of the case, the act of the defendant in shooting
the arrow in the school-room, where there were a number of scholars,
was not lawful; for, if the act in itself was lawful, and there was
not a proper care to guard against consequences injurious to others,
the actor must be held responsible for such consequences.</p>

<p class='c007'>In ordinary cases, if the injury is not the effect of an unavoidable
accident, the person by whom it is inflicted is liable to respond in damages
to the sufferer. Where, in shooting at butts, the archer’s arrow
glanced and struck another, it was holden to be a trespass. Year-Book,
21 H. VII. fol. 28. So where a number of persons were lawfully
exercising themselves at arms, one, whose gun accidentally went off,
was held liable in trespass for the injury occasioned by the accident.
Weaver <em>v.</em> Ward. Where, in a dark night, the defendant got on the
wrong side of the road, and an injury ensued to the person of the plaintiff,
trespass for the damage was sustained. Leame <em>v.</em> Bray, 3 East,
593. It is decided in the case of Wakeman <em>v.</em> Robinson, if the accident
happen entirely without the fault of the defendant, or any blame being
imputable to him, an action will not lie. In that case, the blame imputable
to the defendant was, that, his horse being young and spirited,
he used him without a curb rein; that in his alarm he probably pulled
the wrong rein; and that he ought to have continued on in a straight
course. The blame fairly imputed to the defendant, it will be perceived,
must have been slight indeed, as it certainly was in the case of
the injury done by the glancing of the arrow when shooting at a mark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>(a lawful act), and by the accidental discharge of the musket at a
training; and yet, in each of these cases, an action for the injury was
maintained. Unless a rule is to be applied to this case different from
that applicable to a transaction between adults, the proof was most
abundant to charge the defendant with the consequences of the injury.
Infants, in the same manner as adults, are liable for trespass, slander,
assault, &amp;c.<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c015'><sup>[89]</sup></a> Bing. on Infancy, 110; 8 T. R. 335; 16 Mass. Rep. 389;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>2 Inst. 328. Where infants are the actors, that might probably be
considered an unavoidable accident which would not be so considered
where the actors are adults; but such a distinction, if it exists, does
not apply to this case. The liability to answer in damages for trespass
does not depend upon the mind or capacity of the actors; for
idiots and lunatics, as we see by the case reported in Hobart, are
responsible in the action of trespass for injuries inflicted by them.

<p class='c007'>My Lords, in this case an action was brought by the respondent
against the Metropolitan Railway Company for negligence in not
carrying the respondent safely as a passenger on the railway, and for
injuring his thumb by the act of one of the appellants’ servants in
suddenly and violently closing the door of the railway carriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question is, Was there at the trial any evidence of this negligence
which ought to have been left to the jury? The Court of Common
Pleas, consisting of Lord Coleridge, Mr. Justice Brett, and Mr.
Justice Grove, were of opinion that there was such evidence. The
Court of Appeal was equally divided; the Lord Chief Justice and
Lord Justice of Appeal Amphlett holding that there was evidence, the
Lord Chief Baron and Lord Justice of Appeal Bramwell holding that
there was not.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The facts of the case are very short. The respondent in the evening
of the 18th of July, 1872, took a third-class ticket from Moorgate
Street to Westbourne Park, and got into a third-class compartment;
the compartment was gradually filled up, and when it left King’s
Cross all the seats were occupied. At Gower Street Station three
persons got in and were obliged to stand up. There was no evidence
to show that the attention of the company’s servants was drawn to
the fact of an extra number being in the compartment; but there was
evidence that the respondent remonstrated at their getting in with the
persons so getting in, and a witness who travelled in the same compartment
stated that he did not see a guard or porter at Gower Street.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Portland Road, the next station, the three extra passengers still
remained standing up in the compartment. The door of the compartment
was opened and then shut; but there was no evidence to show
by whom either act was done. Just as the train was starting from
Portland Road there was a rush, and the door of the compartment was
opened a second time by persons trying to get in. The respondent,
who had up to this time kept his seat, partly rose and held up his
hand to prevent any more passengers coming in. After the train had
moved, a porter pushed away the people who were trying to get in,
and slammed the door to, just as the train was entering the tunnel. At
that very moment the respondent, by the motion of the train, fell forward
and put his hand upon one of the hinges of the carriage door to
save himself, and at that moment, by the door being slammed to, the
respondent’s thumb was caught and injured.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case as to negligence having been left to the jury, the jury
found a verdict for the respondent with £50 damages. There was not,
at your lordships’ bar, any serious controversy as to the principles
applicable to a case of this description. The judge has a certain duty
to discharge, and the jurors have another and a different duty. The
judge has to say whether any facts have been established by evidence
from which negligence <em>may be</em> reasonably inferred; the jurors have to
say whether, from those facts, when submitted to them, negligence
<em>ought to be</em> inferred. It is, in my opinion, of the greatest importance
in the administration of justice that these separate functions should
be maintained, and should be maintained distinct. It would be a
serious inroad on the province of the jury, if, in a case where there
are facts from which negligence may reasonably be inferred, the judge
were to withdraw the case from the jury upon the ground that, in his
opinion, negligence ought not to be inferred; and it would, on the
other hand, place in the hands of the jurors a power which might be
exercised in the most arbitrary manner, if they were at liberty to hold
that negligence might be inferred from any state of facts whatever.
To take the instance of actions against railway companies: a company
might be unpopular, unpunctual, and irregular in its service; badly
equipped as to its staff; unaccommodating to the public; notorious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>perhaps for accidents occurring on the line; and when an action was
brought for the consequences of an accident, jurors, if left to themselves,
might, upon evidence of general carelessness, find a verdict
against the company in a case where the company was really blameless.
It may be said that this would be set right by an application to
the court in banc, on the ground that the verdict was against evidence;
but it is to be observed that such an application, even if successful,
would only result in a new trial; and on a second trial, and even on
subsequent trials, the same thing might happen again.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present case I am bound to say that I do not find any evidence
from which, in my opinion, negligence could reasonably be
inferred. The negligence must in some way connect itself, or be connected
by evidence, with the accident. It must be, if I might invent
an expression founded upon a phrase in the civil law, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">incuria dans
locum injuriae</span></i>. In the present case there was no doubt negligence in
the company’s servants, in allowing more passengers than the proper
number to get in at the Gower Street Station; and it may also have
been negligence if they saw these supernumerary passengers, or if
they ought to have seen them, at Portland Road, not to have then removed
them; but there is nothing, in my opinion, in this negligence
which connects itself with the accident that took place. If, when the
train was leaving Portland Road, the overcrowding had any effect on
the movements of the respondent; if it had any effect on the particular
portion of the carriage where he was sitting, if it made him less a
master of his actions when he stood up or when he fell forward, this
ought to have been made matter of evidence; but no evidence of the
kind was given.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards what took place at Portland Road, I am equally unable
to see any evidence of negligence connected with the accident, or indeed
of any negligence whatever. The officials cannot, in my opinion,
be held bound to prevent intending passengers on the platform opening
a carriage door with a view of looking or getting into the carriage.
They are bound to have a staff which would be able to prevent such
persons getting in where the carriage was already full, and this staff
they had, for the case finds that the porter pushed away the persons
who were attempting to get in. So also with regard to shutting the
door; these persons had opened the door, and thereupon it was not
only proper but necessary that the door should be shut by the porter;
and, as the train was on the point of passing into a tunnel, he could
not shut it otherwise than quickly or in this sense violently....</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Blackburn</span>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, I also am of opinion that in this case the judgment
should be reversed, and a nonsuit entered. On a trial by jury it is, I
conceive, undoubted that the facts are for the jury, and the law for
the judge. It is not, however, in many cases practicable completely
to sever the law from the facts.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>But I think it has always been considered a question of law to be
determined by the judge, subject, of course, to review whether there is
evidence which, if it is believed, and the counter-evidence, if any, not
believed, would establish the facts in controversy. It is for the jury
to say whether and how far the evidence is to be believed. And if the
facts, as to which evidence is given, are such that from them a farther
inference of fact may legitimately be drawn, it is for the jury to say
whether that inference is to be drawn or not. But it is for the judge
to determine, subject to review, as a matter of law whether from those
facts that farther inference may legitimately be drawn.</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, in delivering the considered judgment of the Exchequer
Chamber in Ryder <em>v.</em> Wombwell, Law Rep. 4 Ex. 32, 38, Willes, J.,
says: “Such a question is one of mixed law and fact; in so far as it is a
question of fact, it must be determined by a jury, subject no doubt to
the control of the court, who may set aside the verdict, and submit the
question to the decision of another jury; but there is in every case a
preliminary question, which is one of law, viz., whether there is any
evidence on which the jury could properly find the verdict for the
party on whom the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">onus</span></i> of proof lies. If there is not, the judge ought
to withdraw the question from the jury, and direct a nonsuit if the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">onus</span></i> is on the plaintiff, or direct a verdict for the plaintiff if the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">onus</span></i>
is on the defendant. It was formerly considered necessary in all cases
to leave the question to the jury, if there was any evidence, even a
scintilla, in support of the case; but it is now settled that the question
for the judge (subject, of course, to review), is, as is stated by Maule,
J., in Jewell <em>v.</em> Parr, 13 C. B. 909, 916, ‘not whether there is literally
no evidence, but whether there is none that ought reasonably to
satisfy the jury that the fact sought to be proved is established.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>He afterwards observes, Law Rep. 4 Ex. 42, very truly in my
opinion, “There is no doubt a possibility in all cases where the judges
have to determine whether there is evidence on which the jury may
reasonably find a fact, that the judges may differ in opinion, and it
is possible that the majority may be wrong. Indeed, whenever a decision
of the court below on such a point is reversed, the majority must
have been so either in the court above or the court below. This is an
infirmity which must affect all tribunals.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I quite agree that this is so, and it is an evil. But I think it a far
slighter evil than it would be to leave in the hands of the jury a power
which might be exercised in the most arbitrary manner....</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Declaration, that the defendants were possessed of a bridge over
a certain public highway, and it became their duty to maintain and
keep in repair the bridge, so that it should not be injurious to any
person passing under it; yet the defendants so negligently maintained
the bridge, that while the plaintiff was lawfully passing under the
bridge a portion of the materials of the bridge fell down and injured
the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Plea: Not guilty. Issue joined.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial before Hannen, J., at the sittings in Middlesex after
Michaelmas Term, 1869, it appeared, according to the plaintiff’s evidence,
that the plaintiff, on the 20th of January, 1869, was passing
along the Blue Anchor Road, Bermondsey, under the railway bridge
of the defendants, when a brick fell and injured him on the shoulder.
A train had passed just previously, but whether it was a train of the
defendants, or of another company (whose trains also pass over the
bridge), did not appear. The bridge had been built three years, and is
an iron girder bridge resting on iron piers, on one side, and on a perpendicular
brick wall with pilasters, on the other, and the brick fell
from the top of one of the pilasters, where one of the girders rested on
the pilaster.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants called no witnesses,<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c015'><sup>[94]</sup></a> but rested their defence on
there being no evidence of negligence in the defendants; and also on
the ground that the injury to the plaintiff’s shoulder was not really
caused by the falling of the brick.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the evidence of negligence, the learned judge told the jury
that if they thought the bare circumstance of a brick falling out was
not evidence of negligence, they would find for the defendants; if they
thought otherwise, for the plaintiff; and the court would determine
whether there was legal evidence of negligence or not, as to which he
should reserve leave to the defendants to move.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 25<em>l.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>A rule was obtained to enter a nonsuit, on the ground that there was
no evidence of negligence to leave to the jury.<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c015'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cockburn, C. J.</span> As we have had the whole matter carefully
brought before us, with the cases bearing upon the subject, I think we
should gain nothing by taking further time to consider it; and, therefore,
although I regret to say we are not unanimous upon the point, I
think it is better to dispose of the case at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>My own opinion is, that this is a case to which the principle <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa
loquitur</span></i> is applicable, though it is certainly as weak a case as can well
be conceived in which that maxim could be taken to apply. But I
think the maxim is applicable; and my reason for saying so is this.
The company who have constructed this bridge were bound to construct
it in a proper manner, and to use all reasonable care and diligence
in keeping it in such a state of repair that no damage from its
defective condition should occur to those who passed under it, the
public having a right to pass under it. Now we have the fact that a
brick falls out of this structure, and injures the plaintiff. The proximate
cause appears to have been the looseness of the brick, and the
vibration of a train passing over the bridge, acting upon the defective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>condition of the brick. It is clear, therefore, that the structure in
reference to this brick was out of repair. It is clear that it was incumbent
on the defendants to use reasonable care and diligence, and I
think the brick being loose affords, prima facie, a presumption that
they had not used reasonable care and diligence. It is true that it is
possible that, from changes in the temperature, a brick might get into
the condition in which this brickwork appears to have been from
causes operating so speedily as to prevent the possibility of any diligence
and care applied to such a purpose intervening in due time, so as
to prevent an accident. But inasmuch as our experience of these
things is, that bricks do not fall out when brickwork is kept in a
proper state of repair, I think where an accident of this sort happens,
the presumption is that it is not the frost of a single night, or of many
nights, that would cause such a change in the state of this brickwork
as that a brick would fall out in this way; and it must be presumed
that there was not that inspection and that care on the part of the
defendants which it was their duty to apply. On the other hand, I
admit most readily that a very little evidence would have sufficed to
rebut the presumption which arises from the manifestly defective
state of this brickwork. It might have been shown that many causes,
over which the defendants had no control, might cause this defect in
so short a time as that it could not be reasonably expected that they
should have inspected it in the interval. They might, if they were
able, have shown that they had inspected the bridge continually, or
that such a state of things could not be anticipated, and had never
been heard of or known before. Anything which tended to rebut the
presumption arising from an accident caused by the defective condition
of the brickwork, which it was their duty to keep in a proper
condition of repair, even if such evidence were but slight, might have
sufficed; but the defendants chose to leave it on the naked state of
facts proved by the plaintiff. Upon that naked state of facts it is not
unimportant to see what might have been the cause of the defective
condition of this brickwork. We have the fact, the datum, that the
brickwork was in a defective condition, and we have it admitted that
it was the defendants’ duty to use reasonable care and diligence to
keep it in a proper condition. Where it is the duty of persons to do
their best to keep premises, or a structure, of whatever kind it may be,
in a proper condition, and we find it out of condition, and an accident
happens therefrom, it is incumbent upon them to show that they used
that reasonable care and diligence which they were bound to use, and
the absence of which it seems to me may fairly be presumed from the
fact that there was the defect from which the accident has arisen.
Therefore, there was some evidence to go to the jury, however slight
it may have been, of this accident having arisen from the negligence
of the defendants; and it was incumbent on the defendants to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>evidence rebutting the inference arising from the undisputed facts;
that they have not done, and I therefore think this rule must be discharged.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Werner, J.</span> The question presented by this appeal is whether the
case is one in which it is proper to apply the maxim <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i>....<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c015'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The phrase <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i>, literally translated, means that the
thing or affair speaks for itself. It is merely a short way of saying
that the circumstances attendant upon an accident are themselves of
such a character as to justify the conclusion that the accident was
caused by negligence. The inference of negligence is deducible, not
from the mere happening of the accident, but from the attendant circumstances.
“It is not that, in any case, negligence can be assumed
from the mere fact of an accident and an injury; but in these cases
the surrounding circumstances which are necessarily brought into
view by showing how the accident occurred, contain, without further
proof, sufficient evidence of the defendant’s duty and of his neglect
to perform it. The fact of the casualty and the attendant circumstances
may themselves furnish all the proof of negligence that the
injured person is able to offer, or that it is necessary to offer.” Shearman
&amp; Redfield on Negligence, § 59. This section was quoted with
approval by Judge Cullen in writing for this court in Griffen <em>v.</em> Manice,
166 N. Y. 188, 193, and in that connection he expressed the view that
“the application of the principle depends on the circumstances and
character of the occurrence, and not on the relation between the
parties, except indirectly so far as that relation defines the measure of
duty imposed on the defendant.” He quoted also from the opinion
of Judge Danforth in Breen <em>v.</em> N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 109 N. Y. 297,
300, in which the author said “there must be reasonable evidence of
negligence, but when the thing causing the injury is shown to be
under the control of a defendant, and the accident is such as, in the
ordinary course of business, does not happen if reasonable care is used,
it does, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, afford sufficient
evidence that the accident arose from want of care on its part.”
In the Griffen case Judge Cullen followed this quotation from the
Breen case, with the pertinent observation that he could see no reason
“why the rule thus declared is not applicable to all cases or why the
probative force of the evidence depends on the relation of the parties.
Of course, the relation of the parties may determine the fact to be
proved, whether it be want of the highest care or only want of ordinary
care, and, doubtless, circumstantial evidence, like direct evidence,
may be insufficient as a matter of law to establish the want of ordinary
care, though sufficient to prove absence of the highest degree of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>diligence. But the question in every case is the same whether the
circumstances surrounding the occurrence are such as to justify the
jury in inferring the fact in issue.” Thus we see that this court is
definitely committed to the view that the application of the maxim
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i> depends, not upon the relation of the injured person
to the person or party who is charged with causing the injury, but
upon the explanatory circumstances which surround the happening of
the accident. The rule thus expressed has been recognized in the
recent cases of Robinson <em>v.</em> Consolidated Gas Co., 194 N. Y. 37, 41,
and Hardie <em>v.</em> Boland Co., 205 N. Y. 336, 341, and has been followed
in many cases in the several Appellate Divisions.<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c015'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>While it is, therefore, the settled law that the maxim is applicable
to any case where the facts warrant its application, it is apparent that
the employee who invokes it against his employer encounters difficulties
that do not hamper the wayfarer in a public place or the passenger
in a common carrier’s conveyance. The man who was lawfully upon
the highway need go no farther in the first instance than to prove that
he was hit by a falling wall (Mullen <em>v.</em> St. John, 57 N. Y. 567) or by
a flying missile (Wolf <em>v.</em> Am. Tract Soc., 164 N. Y. 30, 33; Hogan <em>v.</em>
Manh. Ry. Co., 149 N. Y. 23; Volkmar <em>v.</em> Manh. Ry. Co., 134 N. Y.
418), and that the thing by which he was injured came from the
premises of the defendant. The passenger who was for the time under
the protection of a common carrier needs only to show that the train
upon which he was riding left the track (Seyboldt <em>v.</em> N. Y., L. E. &amp;
W. R. R. Co., 95 N. Y. 562, 565) or collided with another car or train
(Loudoun <em>v.</em> Eighth Ave. R. R. Co., 162 N. Y. 380) and thus caused
his injuries. The reason for the rule in such cases is not far to seek.
The owner of a building or structure must exercise a high degree of
care to so keep it that the wayfarer on the public streets shall not be
injured by falling walls or missiles. The common carrier is under the
strict duty to its passenger to keep its cars and tracks in a safe condition,
and in all such cases where the plaintiff “has shown a situation
which could not have been produced except by the operation of abnormal
causes, the onus then rests upon the defendant to prove that
the injury was caused without his fault.” Seyboldt <em>v.</em> N. Y., L. E. &amp;
W. R. R. Co., 95 N. Y. 565, 568. Ordinarily walls do not fall, missiles
do not fly and trains are not derailed when those in control are in the
exercise of the requisite care, and, therefore, the inference of negligence
follows in logical sequence.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the nature of things the injured employee who sues his employer
must present a much higher degree of proof than is necessary in the
case of a wayfarer or passenger. It is to be emphasized, however, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>the difference is one of degree and not of kind. This more onerous
burden which is placed upon the employee is the natural concomitant
of the relation of the parties and of their resultant obligations. The
employer is bound merely to the exercise of reasonable care in providing
his employee with a safe place in which to work, with proper and
adequate tools, appliances and machinery, and with fellow-employees
competent for the tasks to which they are assigned. If the injured employee
sues at common law and seeks to invoke the maxim, he must
necessarily make proof of facts and circumstances which, under the
common law, exclude every inference except that of the employer’s
negligence. This means that the employee must himself be free from
the imputation of contributory negligence; that he is not the victim
of the negligence of co-employees; that the injury is not the result of
some risk either inherent in the occupation or voluntarily assumed by
the employee; and that the accident is one which, in the ordinary
course of events, could not have happened if the employer had exercised
the degree of care required of him by the common law. The
same rule applies, in a modified degree, where the employee sues under
the Employers’ Liability Act, as the plaintiff in this case has done. In
such a case the plaintiff must establish facts and circumstances which,
under the statute, would entitle him to recover in the absence of a
sufficient explanation by the defendant, absolving him from the imputation
of negligence. The proof must not be conjectural or speculative,
but must consist of evidence which, tested by the ordinary rules of
experience and observation, points to the single conclusion that the employer’s
omission of a duty which he owes to his employee was the sole
efficient cause of the accident. Ferrick <em>v.</em> Eidlitz, 195 N. Y. 248, 252.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next question, in logical progression, is whether the plaintiff
has established his case by facts and circumstances which negative the
existence of any cause for the accident by which he was injured, save
the negligence of the defendant. The plaintiff, as has been stated, was
a locomotive fireman in the employ of the defendant. On the 25th of
March, 1911, he and his engineer left Malone on engine No. 2055 for
Moira to assist in bringing back a train. After arriving at Moira the
engine was turned around and coupled to another engine already attached
to a train, and a start was made for the return to Malone. Suddenly
there occurred an explosion in the fire box of the engine which
drove the doors from their fastenings, and expelled fire and boiling
water into the cab, and burned and scalded the plaintiff, and blew him
out of the cab to the ground with such force as to bruise him. Although
this accident was of an unusual character, it will be assumed
for the purposes of this discussion that it was not such an occurrence
as would, in and of itself, justify the application of the maxim <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa
loquitur</span></i>, for the engine was then in the custody and control of the
plaintiff and his engineer. The mere happening of the accident did
not necessarily exclude the inference that it might have been caused
by the negligence of the plaintiff, or without any negligence at all.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>It was, therefore, necessary for the plaintiff to supplement the proof
of the accident with evidence tending to show that it resulted from
the failure of the defendant to exercise ordinary care, either in the
selection of the engine or in keeping it in reasonably safe repair. In
that behalf the record discloses a number of facts and circumstances
that bear upon the accident very directly and cogently. It appears
that the train crews employed by the defendant have nothing to do
with the care and inspection of the internal and hidden parts of the
engines. That work is committed to a special corps of employees
whose place of duty is in the hostelry where the engines are housed,
made ready for service, and turned over to the crews designated to
take them out. The engineers are charged with the duty of making a
report of each trip which shall specify any needed repairs that come
under their observation. The engineer Francey, who was on engine
2055 at the time of the accident, testified that he had used it on various
specified dates during the month preceding the day of the accident,
and that he had orally reported it as leaking, although he had been
turning in written reports which made no mention of the fact. While
such a circumstance might ordinarily affect the credibility of a witness,
all doubt upon this subject is dissipated by the testimony of the defendant’s
witnesses showing that the engine was inspected by the foreman
of boiler makers on or about March 21st, 1911, and found to be
in a leaky condition. Several of defendant’s witnesses testified that
the engine had been in the shop at various times during the month on
account of leaking flues, and that the last repairs in this regard were
made two or three days before the accident.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the accident an examination of the engine was made which
revealed the probable cause of the trouble. One of the flues, which
extend longitudinally through the boiler from the rear flue sheet to another
flue sheet next the smoke stack, had been pushed or blown out
of its socket in the rear flue sheet so that the forward end of the flue
projected several feet beyond the forward flue sheet; thus leaving an
opening in the rear flue sheet through which the boiling water and
steam were admitted into the fire pot where the explosion was generated.
There were 342 of these flues which were each 1⅞ inches in
diameter and about 16 feet in length. These flues are “safe ended”
into the flue sheets so that when they are in perfect condition there can
be no leakage through them from the boiler. The particular flue that
was blown or driven out of its place was in the bottom row of flues
where there could be no inspection without taking out the “brick
arch,” and that could be done only when the boiler was not in steam.
There can be no doubt that the explosion by which the plaintiff was
injured was due immediately to the displacement of the flue; but the
cause of the dislodgement of the flue is not so clear. It is a matter of
common knowledge that steam, like electricity, is a capricious and
fickle agency which sometimes causes unexpected and unexplainable
accidents. If the plaintiff’s case were wholly dependent upon evidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>merely showing the happening of this explosion, it might be necessary
to hold that he had not proved enough to give him the benefit of the
maxim which he invokes. The ultimate question, therefore, is whether
he has the support of surrounding circumstances which show that the
accident was of “such a character as does not ordinarily occur where
the party charged with responsibility has exercised the degree of care
and caution required by law to avoid such a mishap.” Henson <em>v.</em>
Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., 194 N. Y. 205, 211. We think he has. The
defendant’s foreman testified that if a flue is loose at both ends it
would be liable to move from the pressure, and that if a flue is loose at
one end it is more liable to move than one that is not loose. It is undisputed
that defendant’s chief boiler man inspected this engine on the
21st or 22d of March and found that a number of flues, about twenty-five,
were leaking. These were repaired, but the boiler still leaked on
the 24th, and the explosion occurred on the 25th. Since the defendant’s
experts had found loose and leaking flues which they repaired,
it is reasonable to infer that the displacement of another flue within
two or three days was attributable to the same cause. This was not a
part of the locomotive over which the plaintiff had any control, or in
respect of which he had, so far as the record discloses, any duty or
knowledge. The work of inspection and repair was the work of the
defendant, and any failure in this regard was its failure. The almost
immediate recurrence of a condition that had led to inspection and
repair was circumstantial evidence which tended to show that the
work had not been thoroughly done. We think, therefore, that the
plaintiff was entitled to rest upon the rule of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i>, and that
in the absence of a satisfactory and convincing explanation by the
defendant, the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>

<p class='c007'>Counsel for the defendant contends that such an explanation has
been made. In that regard it appears that the locomotive was of a
modern and standard type; that for several months from January,
1910, it was in the main shops of the defendant at Rutland, where it
was given a thorough overhauling and sent out in perfect condition;
that the complaints of leakage made in the early part of 1911 were followed
by prompt inspection and complete repair. This was an explanation
well calculated indeed to create a serious issue of fact, but we
think it would be going too far to hold that it was conclusive as matter
of law. The limitations of the rule of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i>, and the legal
effect of defendant’s explanation, were well stated in the charge to the
jury, and we think the judgment entered on the verdict must stand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>

  <h5 class='c013'>WING <em>v.</em> LONDON GENERAL OMNIBUS CO.<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Court of Appeal, July 16, 1909.</span><br /> <em>Reported in [1909] 2 King’s Bench, 652.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Fletcher Moulton, L. J.</span>, read the following judgment:<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c015'><sup>[100]</sup></a>—This
is an appeal from the judgment delivered by the judge of the county
court of Middlesex held in Clerkenwell in an action in which the plaintiff
sued for damages resulting from an accident which occurred while
she was a passenger in a motor omnibus belonging to the defendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff’s claim was based on two alternative grounds: (1) that
the defendants’ servants, whilst in charge of the motor omnibus, were
guilty of negligence causing the accident, and (2) that the motor
omnibus was itself a dangerous machine, and that the defendants were
liable for having placed it upon the roadway, thereby creating a
nuisance, whereby the plaintiff suffered damage.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>The evidence given at the trial as to the nature and circumstances
of the accident was meagre in the extreme. The plaintiff deposed to
nothing more than that she was a passenger in the omnibus, and that
she heard breaking of glass, and knew that the omnibus had hit something,
and that she heard something fall. She tried to get out, and,
in so doing, hurt her foot. No other witness was called who was present
at the time of the accident, but evidence was given on her behalf
by a police constable, who came up afterwards, and proved that an
electric standard had been broken in the accident, and that the hind
step of the motor omnibus had been slightly bent. No other damage
had been caused to the omnibus. He also proved that the road was in
a greasy state at the time by reason of rain that had fallen during the
day. He was asked by the plaintiff’s counsel as to certain admissions
made to him at the time by the driver and conductor of the omnibus,
and proved that they stated to him that the hind part of the omnibus
skidded, when going about five miles an hour, while the driver was
trying to avoid two other vehicles. The defendants called no evidence
except as to the quantum of damage. At the end of the plaintiff’s
case, counsel for the defendants submitted that there was no evidence,
either of negligence or of nuisance, to go to the jury, and the learned
judge gave partial effect to that contention by withdrawing from the
jury the question of negligence in the driving or management of the
car. The plaintiff did not take exception to this by giving a cross
notice of appeal, nor was the point raised before the Divisional Court,
and it is not, in my opinion, open to her counsel to raise it now. But,
apart from this, I am of opinion that the learned judge was right in
so doing. There was no evidence whatever that the accident was due
to negligence on the part of the servants of the defendants who were
in charge of the omnibus, unless the mere occurrence of the accident
amounts to such evidence. In my opinion the mere occurrence of such
an accident is not in itself evidence of negligence. Without attempting
to lay down any exhaustive classification of the cases in which the
principle of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i> applies, it may generally be said that the
principle only applies when the direct cause of the accident, and so
much of the surrounding circumstances as was essential to its occurrence,
were within the sole control and management of the defendants,
or their servants, so that it is not unfair to attribute to them a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima
facie</span></i> responsibility for what happened. An accident in the case of
traffic on a highway is in marked contrast to such a condition of
things. Every vehicle has to adapt its own behaviour to the behaviour
of other persons using the road, and over their actions those in charge
of the vehicle have no control. Hence the fact that an accident has
happened either to or through a particular vehicle is by itself no evidence
that the fault, if any, which led to it was committed by those
in charge of that vehicle. Exceptional cases may occur in which the
peculiar nature of the accident may throw light upon the question on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>whom the responsibility lies, but there is nothing of the kind here.
The collision with the electric standard was due to the omnibus skidding,
and, if we are to give any weight to the admissions made by the
defendants’ servants which were proved in evidence in chief as part of
the plaintiff’s case, that skidding was due to difficulties in avoiding
other vehicles. There is certainly no evidence to negative such a probable
explanation of what actually happened, and it is impossible to say
that this points to negligence, or that it establishes that any negligent
act of the defendants’ servant was the cause of the accident. I am
therefore of opinion that the learned judge acted rightly in withdrawing
from the jury the issue as to the accident being due to negligence
of the defendants’ servants in the driving or management of the
vehicle.<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c015'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'>CARMODY <em>v.</em> BOSTON GAS LIGHT CO.<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, January 2, 1895.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 162 Massachusetts Reports, 539.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Four actions for damages occasioned to the respective plaintiffs by
the escape of gas were tried together.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plaintiffs’ evidence tended to show that gas escaped into plaintiffs’
apartments from defendant’s pipes in the street; that plaintiffs inhaled
the gas while asleep; and that the escape was due to the defective
condition of the pipe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant’s evidence tended to prove that the defect in the pipe
and the consequent escape of gas was due to acts of third persons of
which the defendant had no notice, and not to any negligence of the
defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiffs requested the judge to rule that there was evidence
enough of want of proper care on the part of the defendant to make
it responsible, on the ground that it was bound to conduct its gas in
a proper manner; and that the fact that the gas escaped was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima
facie</span></i> evidence of some neglect on the part of the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge declined so to rule, and instructed the jury as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The mere fact that a pipe broke and the gas escaped is not of itself
sufficient to establish the liability of the company. It is evidence for
you to consider upon the question of neglect; but there is other evidence
bearing upon this question of neglect, and so it becomes a matter
for you to determine, in view of all the evidence bearing upon the
question, the burden being upon the plaintiffs to satisfy you, as a result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>of all the evidence, that there was in fact a neglect by the defendant,
through which, and by means of which, this gas escaped.”</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>Upon the counsel for the plaintiffs remarking, “Your honor has not
given the requests I asked for, and so I will except to that,” the judge
replied as follows: “Well, you asked me to say that the fact that the
gas escaped is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> evidence of some neglect on the part of the
defendant. I do not choose to use that expression ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> evidence,’
unless the defendant consents to it. I have already told the
jury that it was evidence of neglect, or of negligence, on the defendant’s
part, and evidence the force of which it was for them to determine
in connection with any other evidence in the case bearing upon
the same subject.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiffs
alleged exceptions.<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c015'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Barker, J.</span> The plaintiffs asked the court to instruct the jury
“that there was evidence enough of want of proper care on the part
of the defendant to make it responsible, on the ground that it was
bound to conduct its gas in a proper manner, and that the fact that
the gas escaped was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> evidence of some neglect on the part
of the defendant.” This request was copied from a ruling given in
Smith <em>v.</em> Boston Gas Light Co., 129 Mass. 318, where this court said
of it that, as applied to the facts of that case, it could not be said to
be wrong. The presiding justice in the present case declined to give
the instruction, but instructed the jury in other terms, which fully
and correctly dealt with the phases of the cause to which the request
was addressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the ruling requested is sufficiently correct if it be construed
as declaring that there was enough evidence of want of proper care to
be submitted to the jury, it would invade the proper province of the
jury if it was understood by them to mean that there was evidence
enough to require them to find the defendant negligent, and the presiding
justice was not bound to give a ruling which, as applied to the
case upon trial, might have been so understood. Nor was he bound
to use the Latin phrase upon which the plaintiffs insisted, but might
well say, in place of it, that the fact that gas escaped was evidence of
neglect “and evidence the force of which it was for them to determine
in connection with any other evidence in the case bearing on the same
subject.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiffs’ exception did not go to the charge as given, but
merely to the refusal of the request. They nevertheless argue that
the statement of the charge, that “the mere fact that a pipe broke
and the gas escaped is not of itself sufficient to establish the liability
of the company,” was incorrect. But there was evidence with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the jury had to deal tending to show that the defendant had used due
care to conduct its gas in a proper manner, and that the escape of gas
by which the plaintiffs were injured was due to the acts of third persons
of which the defendant had no notice, and not to any negligence
of the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is apparent, from the situation of the evidence and the context
of the charge, that the sentence to which the plaintiffs now object
could not have been understood by the jury as forbidding them to
draw the inference of negligence from the facts that a pipe broke and
that gas escaped; but that, as there was other evidence bearing upon
the question of negligence, they must consider and weigh it all, and
not come to a conclusion upon two circumstances merely.</p>

<p class='c007'>The true construction of the ruling asked, as applied to the case at
bar, would be, that, as matter of law, the breaking of a pipe and the
consequent escape of gas prove negligence. The true rule is, that a
jury may find negligence from those circumstances, but it is for them
to say whether they will do so; and, if there are other circumstances
bearing on the question, they must weigh them all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instructions that evidence “is sufficient to show,” or “has a tenddency
to show,” or “is enough to show,” or “is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> evidence
of,” are not to be understood as meaning that there is a presumption of
fact, but that the jury are at liberty to draw the inference from them.
Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Clifford, 145 Mass. 97. Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Keenan,
148 Mass. 470. And so the instruction in a case where a number of
circumstances bearing upon a question of fact are in evidence, that a
part of them are not of themselves sufficient to establish the fact,
coupled with explicit instructions that they are to be considered, must
be understood as directing the jury to weigh together all the pertinent
circumstances, and not to draw their inference from a part without
considering all.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>BENEDICK <em>v.</em> POTTS<br /> <span class='sc'>Court of Appeals, Maryland, June 28, 1898.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 88 Maryland Reports, 52.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Appeal from Circuit Court, where judgment was entered on a verdict
for defendant, ordered by the court.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant owned and operated, at a pleasure resort, a mimic railway,
which was a wooden structure. Open cars were hoisted up an
incline to the highest point of the railway, and were then run by gravity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>down and around a circular track to the ground. The length of
the spiral track was about two thousand feet, and it made three circuits
before reaching the ground. At about the middle of the last
circle nearest the ground, the cars passed through a tunnel which was
part of the structure. This tunnel was one hundred and fifty feet
long, and completely incased that portion of the track, and hid the cars
and their occupants from all observation when passing through it.
The cars were provided with handles for the occupants to grasp during
the rapid descent. Plaintiff was the sole occupant of the rear seat in
one of the cars. The car was started and made the descent; but when
it reached the ground at the end of the track the plaintiff was not in
it, though as it entered the tunnel he was seen to be upon it. Search
was at once made, and he was found inside the tunnel, in an unconscious
condition, with a wound upon his head. After several days he
was restored to consciousness. For the damages thus sustained, this
suit was brought.</p>

<p class='c007'>The car did not leave the track, no part of it was shown to be out of
repair, the track was not defective, and no explanation is given in the
record as to what caused the injury. The plaintiff distinctly stated
that he made no effort to rise as he passed through the tunnel, and
that he did not relax his grasp on the sides of the car. He was in the
car when it passed into the tunnel. He was not in it when it emerged.
How he got off was not shown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this state of facts the trial court instructed the jury that there
was no legally sufficient evidence to show that the defendant had been
guilty of negligence; and the verdict and judgment were accordingly
entered for defendant. Plaintiff brought up the record by appeal.<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c015'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>McSherry, C. J.</span> This is an action to recover damages for a personal
injury, and the single question which the record presents is
whether there was legally sufficient evidence of the defendant’s imputed
negligence to carry the case to the jury. The facts are few and
simple. [The learned judge then stated the facts.]</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a perfectly well-settled principle that to entitle a plaintiff to
recover in an action of this kind he must show not only that he has
sustained an injury but that the defendant has been guilty of some
negligence which produced that particular injury. The negligence
alleged and the injury sued for must bear the relation of cause and
effect. The concurrence of both and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nexus</span></i> between them must
exist to constitute a cause of action. As an injury may occur from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>causes other than the negligence of the party sued, it is obvious that
before a liability on account of that injury can be fastened upon a particular
individual, it must be shown, or there must be evidence legally
tending to show, that he is responsible for it; that is, that he has been
guilty of the negligence that produced or occasioned the injury. In
no instance can the bare fact that an injury has happened, of itself
and divorced from all the surrounding circumstances, justify the
inference that the injury was caused by negligence. It is true that
direct proof of negligence is not necessary. Like any other fact, negligence
may be established by the proof of circumstances from which
its existence may be inferred. But this inference must, after all, be a
legitimate inference and not a mere speculation of conjecture. There
must be a logical relation and connection between the circumstances
proved and the conclusion sought to be adduced from them. This
principle is never departed from, and in the very nature of things it
never can be disregarded. There are instances in which the circumstances
surrounding an occurrence and giving a character to it are
held, if unexplained, to indicate the antecedent or coincident existence
of negligence as the efficient cause of an injury complained of.
These are the instances where the doctrine of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i> is applied.
This phrase, which literally translated means that “the thing
speaks for itself,” is merely a short way of saying that the circumstances
attendant upon an accident are themselves of such a character
as to justify a jury in inferring negligence as the cause of that accident;
and the doctrine which it embodies, though correct enough in
itself, may be said to be applicable to two classes of cases only, viz.,
“first, when the relation of carrier and passenger exists and the accident
arises from some abnormal condition in the department of actual
transportation; second, where the injury arises from some condition
or event that is in its very nature so obviously destructive of the safety
of person or property and is so tortious in its quality as, in the first
instance at least, to permit no inference save that of negligence on the
part of the person in the control of the injurious agency.” Thomas on
Neg. 574. But it is obvious that in both instances more than the mere
isolated, single, segregated fact that an injury has happened must be
known. The injury, without more, does not necessarily speak or indicate
the <em>cause</em> of that injury—it is colorless; but the act that produced
the injury being made apparent may, in the instances indicated,
furnish the ground for a presumption that negligence set that act in
motion. The maxim does not go to the extent of implying that you
may from the mere fact of an injury infer what physical act produced
that injury; but it means that when the physical act has been shown
or is apparent and is not explained by the defendant, the conclusion
that negligence superinduced it may be drawn as a legitimate deduction
of fact. It permits an inference that the known act which produced
the injury was a negligent act, but it does not permit an inference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>as to what act did produce the injury. Negligence manifestly
cannot be predicated of any act until you know what the act is. Until
you know <em>what</em> did occasion an injury, you cannot say that the defendant
was guilty of some negligence that produced that injury.
There is, therefore, a difference between inferring as a conclusion of
fact <em>what</em> it was that did the injury; and inferring from a known or
proven act occasioning the injury that there was negligence in the act
that did produce the injury. To the first category the maxim <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res
ipsa loquitur</span></i> has no application; it is confined, when applicable at all,
solely to the second. In no case where the thing which occasioned the
injury is unknown has it ever been held that the maxim applies; because
when the thing which produced the injury is unknown it cannot
be said to speak or to indicate the existence of causative negligence.
In all the cases, whether the relation of carrier and passenger existed
or not, the injury alone furnished no evidence of negligence—something
more was required to be shown. For instance: In Penn. R. R.
Co. <em>v.</em> MacKinney, 124 Pa. St. 462, it was said: “A passenger’s leg is
broken, while on his passage, in a railroad car. This mere fact is no
evidence of negligence on the part of the carrier until something
further be shown. If the witness who swears to the injury testifies
also that it was caused by a crash in a collision with another train of
cars belonging to the same carrier, the presumption of negligence
immediately arises; not, however, from the fact that the leg was
broken, but from the circumstances attending the fact.” And so in
Byrne <em>v.</em> Boadle, 2 Hurl. &amp; Colt. 728, there was proof not only of an
injury but there was evidence to show <em>how</em> the injury happened, and
the presumption of negligence was applied, not because of there being
an injury, but because of the way or manner in which the injury was
produced. And in Howser’s case, 80 Md. 146, the injury was caused
by cross-ties falling from a moving train upon the plaintiff who was
walking by the side of the track, and the presumption of negligence
was allowed, not as an inference deducible from the injury itself, but
as a conclusion resulting from the method in which and the instrumentality
by which the injury had been occasioned. In the recent
case of Consolidated Traction Co. <em>v.</em> Thalheimer, Court of Errors and
Appeals, N. J., 2 Amer. Neg. Rep. 196,<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c015'><sup>[105]</sup></a> it appeared that the plaintiff
was a passenger of the appellant, and, having been notified by the
conductor that the car was approaching the point where she desired
to alight, got up from her seat and walked to the door while the car
was in motion, and, while going through the doorway, she was thrown
into the street by a sudden lurch and thus injured. The court said:
“At all events, the fact that such a lurch or jerk occurred, as would
have been unlikely to occur if proper care had been exercised, brings
the case within the maxim <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i>.” The inference of negligence
arose not from the injury to the passenger, but from the <em>act</em> that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>caused the injury. In B. &amp; O. R. R. <em>v.</em> Worthington, 21 Md. 275, the
train was derailed in consequence of an open switch, and it was held
that the injury thus inflicted on the passenger was presumptive
evidence of negligence—not that the mere injury raised such a presumption,
but that the injury caused in the way and under the circumstances
shown indicated actionable negligence unless satisfactorily
explained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether, therefore, there be a contractual relation between the parties
or not, there must be proof of negligence or proof of some circumstances
from which negligence may be inferred, before an action can
be sustained. And whether you characterize that inference an ordinary
presumption of fact, or say of the act that caused the injury, the
thing speaks for itself, you assert merely a rebuttable conclusion deduced
from known and obvious premises. It follows, of course, that
when the <em>act</em> that caused the injury is wholly unknown or undisclosed,
it is simply and essentially impossible to affirm that there was a negligent
act; and neither the doctrine of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i> nor any other
principle of presumption can be invoked to fasten a liability upon the
party charged with having by negligence caused the injury for the
infliction of which a suit has been brought.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, in the case at bar there is no evidence that the car on the track
was out of repair. The car went safely to its destination, carrying
the other occupants. There is no evidence that the roof of the tunnel
struck the appellant, or that the fact that a small part of the central
plank of the tunnel roof had been slabbed off had the most remote
connection with the accident. It is a case presenting not a single circumstance
showing <em>how</em> or by what agency the injury occurred, and
in which, with nothing but the isolated fact of the injury having happened,
being proved, it is insisted that the jury shall be allowed to
speculate as to the cause that produced it, and then to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">infer</span></i> from the
cause thus assumed but not established, that there was actionable negligence.
It is not an attempt to infer negligence from an apparent
cause, but to infer the cause of the injury from the naked fact of injury,
and then to superadd the further inference that this inferred
cause proceeded from negligence. If in Howser’s case, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, there
had been no other evidence than the mere <em>fact</em> of an injury, it cannot
be pretended that the jury would have been allowed to speculate as to
<em>how</em> the injury had occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appellant was on the car when it entered the tunnel; he was
not on the car when it emerged, but was found in an unconscious state
in the tunnel. There was no defect in or abnormal condition affecting
the means of actual transportation. The other occupants of the car
passed safely through. What caused the appellant to be out of the
car is a matter of pure conjecture. No one has explained or attempted
to explain how he got where he was found. Indeed, the two persons
who occupied the front seat were ignorant of the appellant’s absence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>from the car until it had reached its destination, and the appellant
himself distinctly testified that he did not relax his hold to the car
and did not attempt to rise, but lowered his head as he entered the
tunnel. All that is certain is, that he was injured in <em>some</em> way and he
asks that the jury may be allowed, in the absence of all explanatory
evidence, to infer that some act of a negligent character for which the
appellee is responsible, caused the injury sustained by the appellant.
No case has gone to that extent and no known principle can be cited
to sanction such a position. There has been no circumstance shown
which furnishes the foundation for an inference of negligence; and
the circumstances which have been shown obviously do not bring the
case within the doctrine of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i>. There was, consequently,
no error in the ruling complained of, and the judgment of the Circuit
Court must be affirmed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Beckett brought this action against the Flint &amp; Walling Manufacturing
Company to recover damages for harm done to his barn and the
contents thereof, owing to the fact that the company constructed a
windmill thereon in such an insufficient manner that it fell upon the
roof of the barn.</p>

<p class='c007'>The complaint contained, in substance, the following statements:—</p>

<p class='c007'>There was an air-shaft in the centre of the barn, extending from the
bottom to, and projecting through, the roof. Defendant contracted
with plaintiff to erect on the air-shaft a windmill consisting of a wheel,
tower, etc., to be erected in a first-class manner. The defendant
erected the windmill in a negligent manner; especially in the mode of
fastening the tower to the air-shaft. In consequence of this defective
construction, a wind of ordinary velocity caused the windmill to break
and twist the air-shaft and fall about sixty feet on the roof of the barn.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leading contention of appellant’s counsel is that the duty it
owed to appellee arose out of contract, and that, as appellant was not
engaged in a public employment, its obligation could only be enforced
by an action on the contract for a breach thereof. The latter insistence
cannot be upheld. It is, of course, true that it is not every breach of
contract which can be counted on as a tort, and it may also be granted
that if the making of a contract does not bring the parties into such a
relation that a common-law obligation exists, no action can be maintained
in tort for an omission properly to perform the undertaking.
It by no means follows, however, that this common-law obligation
may not have its inception in contract. If a defendant may be held
liable for the neglect of a duty imposed on him, independently of any
contract, by operation of law, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</span></i> ought he to be liable where he
has come under an obligation to use care as the result of an undertaking
founded on a consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the duty has its roots in contract, the undertaking to observe
due care may be implied from the relationship, and should it be the
fact that a breach of the agreement also constitutes such a failure to
exercise care as amounts to a tort, the plaintiff may elect, as the common-law
authorities have it, to sue in case or in assumpsit. It is
broadly stated in 1 Comyn’s Digest, Action on the Case for Negligence,
A 4, p. 418, that “if a man neglect to do that, which he has
undertaken to do, an action upon the case lies.... But, if there be
not any neglect in the defendant, an action upon the case does not lie
against him, though he do not perform his undertaking.” Professor
Pollock says: “One who enters on the doing of anything attended
with risk to the persons or property of others is held answerable for
the use of a certain measure of caution to guard against that risk. To
name one of the commonest applications, ‘those who go personally or
bring property where they know that they or it may come into collision
with the persons or property of others have by law a duty cast
upon them to use reasonable care and skill to avoid such collision.’...
In some cases this ground of liability may coexist with a liability
on contract towards the same person, and arising (as regards the
breach) out of the same facts. Where a man interferes gratuitously,
he is bound to act in a reasonable and prudent manner according to
the circumstances and opportunities of the case. And this duty is not
affected by the fact, if so it be, that he is acting for reward, in other
words, under a contract, and may be liable on the contract. The two
duties are distinct, except so far as the same party cannot be compensated
twice over for the same facts, once for the breach of contract
and again for the wrong. Historically the liability in tort is older;
and indeed it was by special development of this view that the action
of assumpsit, afterwards the common mode of enforcing simple contracts,
was brought into use. ‘If a smith prick my horse with a nail,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>etc., I shall have my action upon the case against him, without any
warranty by the smith to do it well.... For it is the duty of every
artificer to exercise his art rightly and truly as he ought.’” Webb’s
Pollock, Torts, 533–536. This general thought also finds expression
in Mr. Street’s valuable work (1 Street, Foundations of Legal Liability,
92). It is there said: “The general doctrine may be laid down
thus: In every situation where a man undertakes to act or to pursue a
particular course he is under an implied legal obligation or duty to act
with reasonable care, to the end that the person or property of others
may not be injured by any force which he sets in operation or by any
agent for which he is responsible. If he fails to exercise the degree of
caution which the law requires in a particular situation, he is held
liable for any damage that results to another just as if he had bound
himself by an obligatory promise to exercise the required degree of
care. In this view, statements so frequently seen in negligence cases,
to the effect that men are bound to act with due and reasonable care,
are really vital and significant expressions. If there had been any
remedial necessity for so declaring, it could obviously have been said
without violence to the principle that men who undertake to act are
subject to a fictitious or implied promise to act with due care.” See

<p class='c007'>The position in which appellant placed this large and heavy structure,
located, as it was, upon the barn, some seventy feet above the
earth, was such that it was calculated to do great harm to appellee’s
property should it fall. We cannot doubt, in view of the terms of the
contract, construed in the light of the practical construction which the
parties gave to it, to say nothing of the extraneous agreement set forth
in the complaint, that it was the duty of appellant to exercise ordinary
care to secure the tower in such a manner that this heavy and
exposed structure would not, under the action of ordinary winds,
weave around and become detached from the body of the air-shaft.
Insecurely fastened, as the complaint shows that this structure was,
appellant was bound to apprehend that it might fall, and that, if it
did, great injury would thereby be occasioned to appellee. It was
also bound to apprehend, from the very care and skill which it impliedly
held itself out as exercising (a circumstance calculated to
throw appellee off his guard), and from the fact that an examination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>was difficult, that in all probability the defects would not be observed
in time to avoid the injury. Indeed, as laid down in Mowbray <em>v.</em>
Merryweather, [1895] 2 Q. B. 640, and Devlin <em>v.</em> Smith, (1882) 89
N. Y. 470, 42 Am. Rep. 311, appellee owed no duty, so far as appellant
was concerned, to examine the tower. The contrivance was inherently
dangerous, and the circumstances of placing it upon the barn,
as shown, made it calculated to eventuate in harm. This being true,
and as there was no intervening responsible agency between appellee
and the wrong, so that the causal relation remained unbroken, we can
perceive no reason for acquitting appellant of responsibility as a tort
feasor. See Wharton, Negligence (2d ed.), § 438; 1 Beven, Negligence
(2d ed.), 62; Roddy <em>v.</em> Missouri Pac. R. Co., (1891) 104 Mo.
234, 15 S. W. 1112, 12 L. R. A. 746, 24 Am. St. 333. It is not necessary
to consider the extent to which contracts may impose obligations
to exercise care for the protection of third persons, for here the relation
is direct and immediate, but we quote, as showing that there is clearly
a liability in tort, in such a case as this, the following general statements
in 1 Shearman &amp; Redfield, Negligence (5th ed.), § 117, with
reference to the liability for selling dangerous goods: “But one who
knowingly sells an article intrinsically dangerous to human life or
health, such as poison, explosive oils or diseased meat, concealing from
the buyer knowledge of that fact, is responsible to any person who,
without fault on the part of himself or any other person, sufficient to
break the chain of causation, is injured thereby. And we see no reason
why the same rule should not apply to articles known to be dangerous
to property.”</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>A number of questions are argued by appellant’s counsel which are
based upon the contention that the theory of the complaint was that
appellant had committed a breach of contract. The latter insistence
is based on the fact that the contract is set out in full in the complaint.
It is often difficult to determine whether, in the statement of
such a cause of action as the one under consideration, wherein the
very breach of the contract also constitutes negligence, the purpose of
the pleader was to rely upon a breach of contract or to charge negligence
in the violation of the implied duty which was created by the
undertaking of the defendant. It is true that in an action on the case
for negligence, wherein the declaration or complaint is not based on
mere nonfeasance it is not necessary to plead a consideration, and,
therefore, where the action is based on the manner in which an undertaking
was performed, or, in other words, on some misfeasance or malfeasance,
the allegation of a consideration may be regarded as one of
the markings of an action <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex contractu</span></i>. But we do not understand
that this is a controlling consideration; on the contrary, it does not
appear to admit of question that if the contract or consideration be
set out as a matter of inducement only, the plaintiff’s action may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>regarded as one in case for a violation of the common-law duty which
the circumstances had imposed upon the defendant. 1 Chitty, Pleading,
*135; Dickson <em>v.</em> Clifton, 2 Wils. 319; Watson, Damages for Per.
Inj., § 570; 21 Ency. Pl. and Pr., 913. We are especially impressed
with the view that in code pleading, which was designed preëminently
to be a system of fact pleading, a plaintiff, in suing in tort, may
properly set out his contract, as constituting the underlying fact,
instead of charging the defendant’s undertaking in general terms, and
that the plaintiff does not thereby necessarily commit himself to the
theory that his action is for breach of contract. Leeds <em>v.</em> City of Richmond,
(1885) 102 Ind. 372; Parrill <em>v.</em> Cleveland, etc., R. Co., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>;
McMurtry <em>v.</em> Kentucky Cent. R. Co., (1886) 84 Ky. 462, 1 S. W. 815;
Watson, Damages for Per. Inj., § 570. In the complaint before us
appellee not only sets out the written contract, but he pleads a supplemental
or subsidiary agreement as well, so that it can hardly be
said that he relied on the written contract as the foundation of the
action. He charges no breach of the contract except as it can be
implied from the allegations of negligence; he alleges damages “by
reason of the defendant’s negligence, carelessness, imprudence, and
unskilfulness in erecting, constructing, and fastening said steel tower
to said air-shaft as aforesaid;” he charges, in setting forth the total
amount of his damages, that they were occasioned “by reason of the
defendant’s negligence and failure of duty as herein alleged,” and he
avers that he “had no notice or knowledge of the faulty, negligent,
and unskilful erection of said mill,” and that he himself was without
fault or negligence in the premises. In view of the general structure
of the complaint, and applying to it the rule that a construction of a
pleading which will give effect to all of its material allegations is to
be preferred, where reasonably possible (Monnett <em>v.</em> Turpie, [1892]
133 Ind. 424), it appears to us that it must be held that the action was
for the tort. But, admitting that there is room for doubt on this
subject, the fact that the court below, as the record plainly shows,
tried the cause on the theory that it was an action <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex delicto</span></i>, must
settle the question against the contention of appellant. Lake Erie,
etc., R. Co. <em>v.</em> Acres, (1886) 108 Ind. 548; Diggs <em>v.</em> Way, (1899) 22

</div>

<p class='c014'>Appeal from an order of a judge at chambers affirming an order of
a master directing that the plaintiff’s bill of costs should be referred
back to be drawn on the county court scale.</p>

<p class='c007'>The action was brought to recover damages for personal injuries to
the plaintiff while a passenger on the defendants’ railway. The statement
of claim alleged an agreement by the defendants to carry the
plaintiff safely, and a breach of that agreement in negligently and
improperly managing the train in which he was, so that it ran into
the wall at Baker Street Station, whereby the plaintiff sustained
injury. It was admitted by the defendants that the accident occurred
by the negligence of the engine-driver in not turning off steam in time
to prevent the train running into the dead-end at the station. A sum
of 20<em>l.</em> was paid into court, and the jury returned a verdict for the
plaintiff for 25<em>l.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>When the plaintiff’s costs were taken in to be taxed, the master
was of opinion that, on the authority of Taylor <em>v.</em> Manchester, Sheffield,
and Lincolnshire Ry. Co., [1895] 1 Q. B. 134, the act of the
engine-driver being one of omission, the action was founded on contract,
and that therefore the plaintiff was only entitled to costs on the
county court scale. On appeal, this decision was affirmed by Day, J.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Kemp, Q. C.</em>, and <em>Cagney</em>, for the plaintiff, submitted that the action
was in fact an action of tort, and was tried as such, and that the
plaintiff was entitled to costs on the High Court scale.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Lawson Walton, Q. C.</em>, and <em>George Elliott</em>, for the defendants. The
duty of the defendants was contractual, and they were bound to take
due care not to injure the plaintiff. The act which caused the injury
was an omission to turn off steam, and amounted to a nonfeasance.
It was not an act of commission or misfeasance, and the defendants
were not liable in tort. The distinction is dealt with in the judgment
of Lindley, L. J., and A. L. Smith, L. J., in Taylor <em>v.</em> Manchester,
Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Ry. Co., [1895] 1 Q. B. 134, and the present
case comes within that authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>[They also cited Foulkes <em>v.</em> Metropolitan District Ry. Co., 4 C. P.
D. 267; 5 C. P. D. 157.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>A. L. Smith, L. J.</span>, read the following judgment:<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c015'><sup>[109]</sup></a> There appears
to have been some misapprehension as to what was decided in the case
of Taylor <em>v.</em> Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Ry. Co., [1895]
1 Q. B. 134, to which I was a party.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>The plaintiff in the present case was a passenger on the defendants’
railway, and whilst lawfully riding in one of their carriages was injured
by its being negligently run into a dead-end by the defendants’
driver.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been thought by the master, and also by Day, J., that, because
the negligence was that the driver omitted to turn off steam,
this constituted a nonfeasance or omission within what was said in the
above-mentioned case, and that as the plaintiff had recovered 25<em>l.</em> and
no more he was only entitled to county court costs. I am clearly of
opinion that this is not what was decided, nor is any such statement
to be found in that judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction between acts of commission or misfeasance, and
acts of omission or nonfeasance, does not depend on whether a driver
or signalman of a defendant company has negligently turned on steam
or negligently hoisted a signal, or whether he has negligently omitted
to do the one or the other. The distinction is this, if the cause of
complaint be for an act of omission or nonfeasance which without
proof of a contract to do what has been left undone would not give
rise to any cause of action (because no duty apart from contract to
do what is complained of exists), then the action is founded upon
contract and not upon tort. If, on the other hand, the relation of the
plaintiff and the defendants be such that a duty arises from that relationship,
irrespective of contract, to take due care, and the defendants
are negligent, then the action is one of tort, and as regards the County
Court Acts and costs this is what was laid down in the above-mentioned
case. The appeal should be allowed with costs here and below.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Rigby, L. J.</span> I entirely agree. It appears to me that the attempt
to dissect the act of the defendants’ servant, and to treat the mere
omission to turn off steam as a nonfeasance within the meaning of the
cases referred to, altogether fails. An engine-driver is in charge of the
train, and a passenger is in that train, independently of contract, with
the permission of the defendants. That passenger is injured in consequence
of the train being negligently brought into collision with the
dead-end. The proper description of what was done is that it was
a negligent act in so managing the train as to allow it to come into
contact with the dead-end and so cause the accident. It is a case in
which the company by their servant neglected a duty which they owed
to the plaintiff—that is to say, it was a case in which an action of
tort could be brought.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Action by Mrs. Grizzle against the Southern Railway Company
and T. A. O’Neal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The petition alleged, in substance, that the petitioner’s husband
was killed by the negligence of the railway company, and of O’Neal,
who was the engineer in charge of the train, while the train was being
operated over a public-road crossing. It was alleged, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>, that
no bell was rung nor whistle sounded, nor the speed of the train
checked, and that the requirements of the blow-post law<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c015'><sup>[111]</sup></a> were entirely
disregarded by the engineer. To this petition O’Neal demurred
on several grounds. The demurrer was overruled, and O’Neal
excepted.<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c015'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cobb, P. J.</span> 1. An agent is not ordinarily liable to third persons
for mere nonfeasance. Kimbrough <em>v.</em> Boswell, 119 Ga. 210. An
agent is, however, liable to third persons for misfeasance.<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c015'><sup>[113]</sup></a> Nonfeasance
is the total omission or failure of the agent to enter upon the
performance of some distinct duty or undertaking which he has agreed
with his principal to do. Misfeasance means the improper doing of an
act which the agent might lawfully do; or, in other words, it is the
performing of his duty to his principal in such a manner as to infringe
upon the rights and privileges of third persons. Where an agent fails
to use reasonable care or diligence in the performance of his duty, he
will be personally responsible to a third person who is injured by such
misfeasance. The agent’s liability in such cases is not based upon the
ground of his agency, but upon the ground that he is a wrong-doer,
and as such he is responsible for any injury he may cause. When
once he enters upon the performance of his contract with his principal,
and in doing so omits, or fails to take reasonable care in the commission
of, some act which he should do in its performance, whereby some
third person is injured, he is responsible therefor to the same extent as
if he had committed the wrong in his own behalf. See 2 Clark &amp;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Skyles on Agency, 1297 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i> Misfeasance may involve also to some
extent the idea of not doing; as where an agent engaged in the performance
of his undertaking does not do something which it is his
duty to do under the circumstances, or does not take that precaution
or does not exercise that care which a due regard to the rights of others
requires. All this is not doing, but it is not the not doing of that which
is imposed upon the agent merely by virtue of his relation, but of that
which is imposed upon him by law as a responsible individual in common
with all other members of society. It is the same not doing which
constitutes actionable negligence in any relation. Mechem on Ag.
§ 572. As was said by Gray, C. J., in Obsorne <em>v.</em> Morgan, 130 Mass.
102 (39 Am. Rep. 439): “If the agent once actually undertakes and
enters upon the execution of a particular work, it is his duty to use
reasonable care in the manner of executing it, so as not to cause any
injury to third persons which may be the natural consequence of his
acts; and he cannot, by abandoning its execution midway and leaving
things in a dangerous condition, exempt himself from liability to any
person who suffers injury by reason of his having so left them without
proper safeguards. This is not nonfeasance or doing nothing, but it is
misfeasance, doing improperly.” In that case the agent was held liable
by the fall of a tackle-block and chains from an iron rail suspended
from the ceiling of a room, which fell for the reason that the agent had
suffered them to remain in such a manner and so unprotected that
they fell upon and injured the plaintiff. In Bell <em>v.</em> Josselyn, 3 Gray,
309 (63 Am. Dec. 742), Metcalf, J., said: “Assuming that he was a
mere agent, yet the injury for which this action was brought was not
caused by his nonfeasance, but by his misfeasance. Nonfeasance is
the omission of an act which a person ought to do; misfeasance is the
improper doing of an act which a person might lawfully do.... The
defendant’s omission to examine the state of the pipes,&#160;... before
causing the water to be let on, was a nonfeasance. But if he had not
caused the water to be let on, that nonfeasance would not have injured
the plaintiff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present case the failure of the engineer to comply with the
requirements of the blow-post law was not doing, but the running of
the train over the crossing at a high rate of speed without giving the
signals required by law was a positive act, and the violation of a duty
which both the engineer and the railroad company owed to travelers
upon the highway. The engineer having once undertaken in behalf
of the principal to run the train, it was incumbent upon him to run
it in the manner prescribed by law; and a failure to comply with the
law, although it involved an act of omission, was not an act of mere
nonfeasance, but was an act of misfeasance. This view is strengthened
by the fact that the blow-post law renders the engineer indictable
for failure to comply with its provisions. The allegations of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>petition were therefore sufficient to charge O’Neal with a positive
tort, for which the plaintiff would be entitled to bring her action
against him.<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c015'><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Tort for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by the
negligence of the servants of the defendant on February 7, 1903,
while the plaintiff was a passenger of the defendant. Writ dated
March 20, 1903.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial in the Superior Court, Wait, J., at the close of the plaintiff’s
evidence ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff
alleged exceptions. The material evidence is described or quoted in
the opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Knowlton, C. J.</span> This action was brought to recover for an injury
alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant’s servants.
The plaintiff was a passenger on the defendant’s train, which
ran from Boston through Ashmont on the evening of February 7,
1903. He testified to having become so intoxicated that he had no
recollection of anything that occurred after leaving a cigar store in
Boston, until he awoke in the Boston City Hospital, about four o’clock
the next day. One Thompson testified “that he took the 9.23 train
on the evening of February 7, 1903, at the South Station in Boston
for Ashmont, and occupied a seat near the rear of the last car of the
train; that there were about twenty passengers in the car, and he
noticed Black sitting in the seat opposite, very erect, with his eyes
closed. When the conductor came through, Mr. Black went through
his pockets as if he were looking for a ticket, and not being able to find
it, tendered a fifty-cent piece in payment for his fare. The conductor
began to name off the stations from Field’s Corner first and then
Ashmont and when he said ‘Ashmont,’ Mr. Black nodded his head.
The conductor gave him his change and his rebate check. At Ashmont,
where the train stops, there is a gravelled walk, running the
whole length, as a platform, then there is a flight of steps, ten or
twelve, that leads up to the asphalt walk around the station, so when
you go up from the steps you have to walk along this walk. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>conductor and brakeman took Black out of the car, with one on each
side. The distance from the steps of the car to the steps that lead up
to the station was twenty-five feet. As they went along the platform,
the conductor and trainman were on each side of him. They tried to
stand him up, but his legs would sink away from him. They sort of
helped him up and carried him to the bottom of the steps. When
they went to the bottom of the steps, they continued, one on each side
of him. Then one of the men got on one side with his arm around him
and the other back of him sort of pushing him, and they took him up
about the fifth or sixth step, and after they got him up there, they
turned right around and left him and went down the steps. Mr. Black
sort of balanced himself there just a minute and then fell completely
backward. He turned a complete somersault and struck on the back
of his head. The railroad men just had time to get down to the foot of
the steps. There was a railing that led up those steps and the steps
were about ten feet wide. Mr. Black was upon the right-hand side
going up and he was left right near the railing. When he fell, he did
not seize hold of anything, his arms were at his side.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On this testimony the jury might find that the plaintiff was so intoxicated
as to be incapable of standing, or walking, or caring for
himself in any way, and that the defendant’s servants, knowing his
condition, left him halfway up the steps where they knew, or ought to
have known, that he was in great danger of falling and being seriously
injured. They were under no obligation to remove him from the car,
or to provide for his safety after he left the car. But they voluntarily
undertook to help him from the car, and they were bound to use ordinary
care in what they did that might affect his safety. Not only in
the act of removal, but in the place where they left him, it was their
duty to have reasonable regard for his safety in view of his manifest
condition. The jury might have found that they were negligent in
leaving him on the steps, where a fall would be likely to do him much
harm. Moody <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, 189 Mass. 277.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defence rests principally upon the fact that the plaintiff was
intoxicated, and was incapable of caring for himself after he was taken
from the train, and therefore was not in the exercise of due care. If
his voluntary intoxication was a direct and proximate cause of the
injury, he cannot recover. The plaintiff contends that it was not a
cause, but a mere condition, well known to the defendant’s servants,
and that their act was the direct and proximate cause of the injury,
with which no other act or omission had any causal connection. The
distinction here referred to is well recognized in law....</p>

<p class='c007'>We are of opinion that the jury in the present case might have
found that the plaintiff was free from any negligence that was a direct
and proximate cause of the injury.</p>

  <h5 class='c013'>UNION PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY <em>v.</em> CAPPIER<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Kansas, April 11, 1903.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 66 Kansas Reports, 649.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Error</span> from Wyandotte District Court.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Smith, J.</span> This was an action brought by Adeline Cappier, the
mother of Irvin Ezelle, to recover damages resulting to her by reason
of the loss of her son, who was run over by a car of plaintiff in error,
and died from the injuries received. The trial court, at the close of
the evidence introduced to support a recovery by plaintiff below, held
that no careless act of the railway company’s servants in the operation
of the car was shown, and refused to permit the case to be considered
by the jury on the allegations and attempted proof of such negligence.
The petition, however, contained an averment that the injured person
had one leg and an arm cut off by the car-wheels, and that the servants
of the railway company failed to call a surgeon, or to render him
any assistance after the accident, but permitted him to remain by the
side of the tracks and bleed to death. Under this charge of negligence
a recovery was had.</p>

<p class='c007'>While attempting to cross the railway tracks Ezelle was struck by
a moving freight-car pushed by an engine. A yardmaster in charge of
the switching operations was riding on the end of the car nearest to
the deceased and gave warning by shouting to him. The warning was
either too late or no heed was given to it. The engine was stopped.
After the injured man was clear of the track, the yardmaster signalled
the engineer to move ahead, fearing, as he testified, that a passenger
train then about due would come upon them. The locomotive and
car went forward over a bridge, where the general yardmaster was
informed of the accident and an ambulance was summoned by telephone.
The yardmaster then went back where the injured man
was lying and found three Union Pacific switchmen binding up the
wounded limbs and doing what they could to stop the flow of blood.
The ambulance arrived about thirty minutes later and Ezelle was
taken to a hospital, where he died a few hours afterward.</p>

<p class='c007'>In answer to particular questions of fact, the jury found that the
accident occurred at 5.35 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>; that immediately one of the railway
employees telephoned to police headquarters for help for the injured
man; that the ambulance started at 6.05 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> and reached the nearest
hospital with Ezelle at 6.20 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, where he received proper medical
and surgical treatment. Judgment against the railway company was
based on the following question and answer:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ques. Did not defendant’s employees bind up Ezelle’s wounds
and try to stop the flow of blood as soon as they could after the accident
happened? Ans. No.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>The lack of diligence in the respect stated was intended, no doubt,
to apply to the yardmaster, engineer, and fireman in charge of the car
and engine.</p>

<p class='c007'>These facts bring us to a consideration of the legal duty of these
employees toward the injured man after his condition became known.
Counsel for defendant in error quotes the language found in Beach on
Contributory Negligence (3d ed.), § 215, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Under certain circumstances, the railroad may owe a duty to a
trespasser after the injury. When a trespasser has been run down, it
is the plain duty of the railway company to render whatever service
is possible to mitigate the severity of the injury. The train that has
occasioned the harm must be stopped, and the injured person looked
after; and, when it seems necessary, removed to a place of safety, and
carefully nursed, until other relief can be brought to the disabled
person.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal authority cited in support of this doctrine is Northern
Central Railway Co. <em>v.</em> The State, use of Price et al, 29 Md. 420, 96
Am. Dec. 545. The court in that case first held that there was evidence
enough to justify the jury in finding that the operatives of the
train were negligent in running it too fast over a road-crossing without
sounding the whistle, and that the number of brakemen was insufficient
to check its speed. Such negligence was held sufficient to uphold
the verdict, and would seem to be all that was necessary to be said.
The court, however, proceeded to state that, from whatever cause
the collision occurred, it was the duty of the servants of the company,
when the man was found on the pilot of the engine in a helpless and
insensible condition, to remove him, and to do it with proper regard
to his safety and the laws of humanity. In that case the injured person
was taken in charge by the servants of the railway company and,
being apparently dead, without notice to his family, or sending for a
physician to ascertain his condition, he was moved to defendant’s
warehouse, laid on a plank and locked up for the night. The next
morning, when the warehouse was opened, it was found that during
the night the man had revived from his stunned condition and moved
some paces from the spot where he had been laid, and was found in a
stooping posture, dead but still warm, having died from hemorrhage
of the arteries of one leg, which was crushed at and above the knee.
It had been proposed to place him in the defendant’s station-house,
which was a comfortable building, but the telegraph operator objected,
and directed him to be taken into the warehouse, a place used for the
deposit of old barrels and other rubbish.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Maryland case does not support what is so broadly stated in
Beach on Contributory Negligence. It is cited by Judge Cooley, in
his work on Torts, in a note to a chapter devoted to the negligence of
bailees (ch. xx.), indicating that the learned author understood the
reasoning of the decision to apply where the duty began after the
railway employees had taken charge of the injured person.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>After the trespasser on the track of a railway company has been
injured in collision with a train, and the servants of the company have
assumed to take charge of him, the duty arises to exercise such care
in his treatment as the circumstances will allow. We are unable, however,
to approve the doctrine that when the acts of a trespasser himself
result in his injury, where his own negligent conduct is alone the
cause, those in charge of the instrument which inflicted the hurt, being
innocent of wrong-doing, are nevertheless blamable in law if they neglect
to administer to the sufferings of him whose wounds we might
say were self-imposed. With the humane side of the question courts
are not concerned. It is the omission or negligent discharge of legal
duties only which come within the sphere of judicial cognizance. For
withholding relief from the suffering, for failing to respond to the calls
of worthy charity, or for faltering in the bestowment of brotherly
love on the unfortunate, penalties are found not in the laws of men,
but in that higher law, the violation of which is condemned by the
voice of conscience, whose sentence of punishment for the recreant act
is swift and sure. In the law of contracts it is now well understood
that a promise founded on a moral obligation will not be enforced in
the courts. Bishop states that some of the older authorities recognize
a moral obligation as valid, and says:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Such a doctrine, carried to its legitimate results, would release the
tribunals from the duty to administer the law of the land; and put, in
the place of law, the varying ideas of morals which the changing incumbents
of the bench might from time to time entertain.” (Bish.
Cont. § 44.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Ezelle’s injuries were inflicted, as the court below held, without the
fault of the yardmaster, engineer, or fireman in charge of the car and
locomotive. The railway company was no more responsible than it
would have been had the deceased been run down by the cars of another
railroad company on a track parallel with that of plaintiff in
error. If no duty was imposed on the servants of defendant below to
take charge of, and care for, the wounded man in such a case, how
could a duty arise under the circumstances of the case at bar? In
Barrows on Negligence, page 4, it is said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The duty must be owing from the defendant to the plaintiff,
otherwise there can be no negligence, so far as the plaintiff is concerned;&#160;... and the duty must be owing to plaintiff in an individual
capacity, and not merely as one of the general public.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This excludes from actionable negligence all failures to observe
the obligations imposed by charity, gratitude, generosity, and the kindred
virtues. The moral law would obligate an attempt to rescue a
person in a perilous position,—as a drowning child,—but the law of
the land does not require it, no matter how little personal risk it might
involve, provided that the person who declines to act is not responsible
for the peril.” (See, also, Kenney <em>v.</em> The Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph
Railroad Company, 70 Mo. 252, 257.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>In the several cases cited in the brief of counsel for defendant in
error to sustain the judgment of the trial court, it will be found that
the negligence on which recoveries were based occurred after the time
when the person injured was in the custody and care of those who
were at fault in failing to give him proper treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judgment of the court below will be reversed, with directions
to enter judgment on the findings of the jury in favor of the railway
company.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>HUNICKE <em>v.</em> MERAMEC QUARRY COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court of Missouri, December 19, 1914.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 262 Missouri Reports, 560.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Woodson, P. J.</span>... I do not understand counsel for plaintiff to
make the broad claim that, in the absence of the question of <em>emergency</em>,
presented in this case, it would have been the duty of the
defendant to have furnished medical or surgical treatment for the
injured man, upon the occasion mentioned; but I do understand
counsel to contend, and which I believe is the law, that when an
employee is engaged in any dangerous business for the master, and
while in the performance of his duties, as such, he is so badly injured
that he is thereby rendered physically or mentally incapable of procuring
medical assistance for himself, then that duty, as a matter of
law, is devolved upon the master, and that he must perform that duty
with reasonable diligence and in a reasonable manner, through the
agency of such of his employees as may be present at the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other words, without trying to state the law in detail governing
the masters duties in all cases of this character, that duty is put in
operation whenever, under the facts and circumstances of the case,
the employee is thereby so injured that he or she is incapacitated
from caring for himself or herself, as the case may be.</p>

<p class='c007'>The uncontradicted evidence in this case shows that the deceased
was so badly injured that he was physically incapacitated to care for
himself or to engage medical or surgical treatment; also, that the
character of his injuries was such as required immediate surgical attention,
for it was apparent to all present that his leg was frightfully
crushed, and that his life’s blood was freely flowing from his body.
So obvious was this that several of those present, at the time of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>accident, tried by their crude methods, to stop its flow. But the
highest officer of the company present, the superintendent, thought
none of their remedies were worthy of trial and told them their proposed
treatment would do no good. He then telephoned to Dr. Kirk,
at Kimswick, the condition of the injured man, Hunicke, and requested
him to come to Wicks and treat the injured man; but the
doctor being previously engaged in a serious case, could not leave it.
The doctor, however, telephoned the superintendent to bring the injured
party to Kimswick, some two miles distant, and that he would
there treat him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evidence shows that both Wicks and Kimswick were on the
railroad and that a hand-car was present which could have been used
in conveying Hunicke from the former to the latter place for treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some reason not made clear, the superintendent declined to
take the injured man to Kimswick for treatment, but telephoned the
facts of the injury to the manager of the company at St. Louis, some
twelve or fourteen miles distant, who telephoned back to the superintendent
to place the injured man on the next train and send him to
St. Louis. This was done; and some three or four hours later, the
train arrived in the city; and upon the arrival of the train Hunicke
was speedily taken to the hospital where his limb was amputated;
but in the meantime practically all of the blood of his body had flowed
therefrom, and he died shortly thereafter.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the statement of the case we have set out much of the evidence
tending to show the negligence of the defendant in not procuring
surgical treatment for Hunicke more promptly, and that he would
not have died had he received prompt treatment. That evidence
tended to show that Kimswick was only two miles distant from the
place of injury and that the injured man could have been taken there
on a hand-car in a very <em>few</em> minutes, probably from fifteen to twenty,
at the outside. Had this been done, in all probability the flow of blood
would have been stanched several hours before it was finally stopped
in the city of St. Louis.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that there was some evidence which tended to show that
such a trip on a hand-car would have been rough and jolting, and
thereby might have aggravated the flow of the blood, but conceding
that to be true, it could not have caused more waste of blood than did
the constant flow during the hours that passed while he was waiting
for the train and being conveyed to the city of St. Louis thereon. And
it seems to me that common sense would teach us that a trip on a
hand-car to Kimswick would not have caused the blood to flow more
freely than the trip on the train to St. Louis, six or seven times as far,
would have done.</p>

<p class='c007'>But be that as it may, when we consider those facts in connection
with all the other facts and circumstances shown by the evidence, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>have reached the conclusion that this, as well as the question of negligence
in delaying the procurement of a surgeon, was for the jury, and
that the evidence introduced was sufficient to make out a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i>
case for the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other words, we are of the opinion that the evidence tended to
show that the company was guilty of negligence in not using more
diligence in procuring medical and surgical treatment for this party;
also that it tended to show that said negligence was the proximate
cause of his death.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>In my opinion there is no possibility of doubt but what the law is
that, whenever one person employs another to perform dangerous
work, and while performing that work he is so badly injured as to
incapacitate him from caring for himself, then the duty of providing
medical treatment for him is devolved upon the employer; and that
duty in my opinion, grows out of the fact that when we get down to
the real facts in all such cases, there is an unexpressed humane and
natural understanding existing between them to the effect that whenever
any one in such a case is so injured that he cannot care for himself,
then the employer will furnish him medical or surgical treatment as
the case may be.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is common knowledge. There is not an industrial institution
in this country, great or small, where that practice is not being carried
on to-day; and that has been the custom and usage among men from
the dawn of civilization down to the present day, and will continue to
be practised in the future, just so long as the human heart beats in
sympathy for the unfortunate, and desires to aid suffering humanity.
The same principle underlies all other avocations of life. Even armies
while engaged in actual warfare observe and obey this rule when possible.
The soldier who refuses to render surgical or medical aid to the
victim of his own sword, is eschewed by all decent men; while upon
the other hand, all who administer to the wants and necessities of the
sick and wounded are considered as God’s noblemen and as princes
among men. So universally true and deep-seated is this humane feeling
among men, and so universally recognized and practised among
them, that it has become a world-wide rule of moral conduct among
men, brothers, friends and foes; and it says to one and all, You must
exercise all reasonable efforts and means at hand to alleviate the pain
and suffering and save the lives and limbs of those who have been
stricken in your presence. For the violation of this rule of moral
conduct there is no penalty attached save the condemnation of God
and the scorn of all good men and women.</p>

<p class='c007'>But seeing the wisdom, goodness and justice of this moral law, the
law of the land laid its strong hand upon it, the same as it did upon
many other good and useful customs of England, and breathed into
it a living rule of legal conduct among men. It says unto all who employ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>labor that, because of this universally practised custom of men
to furnish medical and surgical aid for those who are stricken in their
presence, you must furnish the employee with such services when he
is so badly injured that he is incapacitated from caring for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is but the application or extension of the common-law rule
which requires the master to furnish his servant with a safe place in
which to work, and safe instrumentalities with which to perform that
labor.</p>

<p class='c007'>That law grew out of the old customs and usages of the English
people, of furnishing their servants with a safe place in which to work
and safe instrumentalities with which to labor. So universally true
was that custom that the law read into all contracts of labor an implied
promise on the part of the master to furnish those safeguards to
his servants. There is no statutory or written law upon the subject.
It is simply what is called the unwritten or common law of England,
which has been adopted by statutes in this and many other States of
the Union.</p>

<p class='c007'>So in like manner into the universal custom of employers furnishing
his employees with medical aid when so badly injured that they could
not care for themselves, the common law, as in the cases of the safety
appliances before mentioned, breathed an implied agreement or duty
on the part of the former to furnish the latter medical or surgical aid
whenever he was so badly injured that he could not care for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>This law, like the one previously mentioned, has no statutory
origin, but has ripened into a law from wise and humane usages and
customs that are so old that the memory of man runneth not to the
contrary, and will continue so long as the conduct of man is prompted
and governed by love and humane sentiments.</p>

<p class='c007'>As previously stated, I am firmly of the opinion that the petition
stated a good cause of action against the defendant, and that the
evidence was sufficient to make a case for the jury; and so believing,
I think the action of the trial court in granting a new trial to the
plaintiff for the first and second reasons assigned by counsel for
defendant, was not erroneous, but proper.<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c015'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'>DEPUE <em>v.</em> FLATAU<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Minnesota, March 15, 1907.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 100 Minnesota Reports, 299.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Action in the District Court for Watonwan County to recover
$5000 for personal injuries. The case was tried before Lorin Cray, J.,
who, at the conclusion of plaintiff’s testimony, dismissed the action.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>From an order denying a motion for a new trial, plaintiff appealed.
Reversed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Brown, J.</span> The facts in this somewhat unusual case are as follows:
Plaintiff was a cattle buyer, and accustomed to drive through the
country in the pursuit of his business, buying cattle, hides, and furs
from the farmers. On the evening of January 23, 1905, about five or
5.30 o’clock, after having been out a day or two in the country, he
called at the house of defendants, about seven miles from Madelia,
where he resided. His object was to inspect some cattle which Flatau,
Sr., had for sale, and if arrangements could be made to purchase the
same. It was dark at the time of his arrival, but he inspected the
cattle in the barn, and suggested to defendant that, being unable to
determine their value by reason of the darkness, he was not prepared
to make an offer for the cattle, and requested the privilege of remaining
over night, to the end that a bargain might be made understandingly
in the morning. His request was not granted. Plaintiff then
bought some furs from other members of defendants’ family, and
Flatau, Sr., invited him to remain for supper. Under this invitation
plaintiff entered the house, paid for the furs, and was given supper
with the family. After the evening meal, plaintiff and both defendants
repaired to the sitting-room of the house, and plaintiff made preparation
to depart for his home. His team had not been unhitched
from the cutter, but was tied to a hitching post near the house. The
testimony from this point leaves the facts in some doubt. Plaintiff
testified that soon after reaching the sitting-room he was taken with a
fainting spell and fell to the floor. He remembers very little of what
occurred after that, though he does recall that, after fainting, he again
requested permission to remain at defendants’ over night, and that his
request was refused. Defendants both deny that this request was
made, and testified, when called for cross-examination on the trial,
that plaintiff put on his overshoes and buffalo coat unaided, and that,
while adjusting a shawl about his neck, he stumbled against a partition
between the dining-room and the sitting-room, but that he did not
fall to the floor. Defendant Flatau, Jr., assisted him in arranging his
shawl, and the evidence tends to show that he conducted him from
the house out of doors and assisted him into his cutter, adjusting the
robes about him and attending to other details preparatory to starting
the team on its journey. Though the evidence is somewhat in
doubt as to the cause of plaintiff’s condition while in defendants’
home, it is clear that he was seriously ill and too weak to take care of
himself. He was in this condition when Flatau, Jr., assisted him
into the cutter. He was unable to hold the reins to guide his team,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>and young Flatau threw them over his shoulders and started the
team towards home, going a short distance, as he testified, for the
purpose of seeing that the horses took the right road to Madelia.
Plaintiff was found early next morning by the roadside, about three
quarters of a mile from defendants’ home, nearly frozen to death.
He had been taken with another fainting spell soon after leaving
defendants’ premises, and had fallen from his cutter, where he remained
the entire night. He was discovered by a passing farmer,
taken to his home, and revived. The result of his experience necessitated
the amputation of several of his fingers, and he was otherwise
physically injured and his health impaired. Plaintiff thereafter
brought this action against defendants, father and son, on the theory
that his injuries were occasioned solely by their negligent and wrongful
conduct in refusing him accommodations for the night, and, knowing
his weak physical condition, or at least having reasonable grounds
for knowing it, by reason of which he was unable to care for himself,
in sending him out unattended to make his way to Madelia the best
he could. At the conclusion of plaintiff’s case, the trial court dismissed
the action, on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to
justify a recovery. Plaintiff appealed from an order denying a new
trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two questions are presented for consideration: (1) Whether, under
the facts stated, defendants owed any duty to plaintiff which they
negligently violated; and (2) whether the evidence is sufficient to
take the case to the jury upon the question whether defendants knew,
or under the circumstances disclosed ought to have known, of his
weak physical condition, and that it would endanger his life to send
him home unattended.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case is an unusual one on its facts, and “all-four” precedents
are difficult to find in the books. In fact, after considerable research,
we have found no case whose facts are identical with those at bar.
It is insisted by defendants that they owed plaintiff no duty to entertain
him during the night in question, and were not guilty of any
negligent misconduct in refusing him accommodations, or in sending
him home under the circumstances disclosed. Reliance is had for
support of this contention upon the general rule as stated in note to
Union Pacific <em>v.</em> Cappier, [66 Kan. 649, 72 Pac. 281] 69 L. R. A. 513,
where it is said: “Those duties which are dictated merely by good
morals or by humane considerations are not within the domain of the
law. Feelings of kindliness and sympathy may move the Good Samaritan
to minister to the needs of the sick and wounded at the roadside,
but the law imposes no such obligation; and suffering humanity
has no legal complaint against those who pass by on the other side....
Unless, therefore, the relation existing between the sick, helpless, or
injured and those who witness their distress is such that the law imposes
the duty of providing the necessary relief, there is neither obligation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>to minister on the one hand, nor cause for legal complaint on the
other.” This is no doubt a correct statement of the general rule
applicable to the Good Samaritan, but it by no means controls a case
like that at bar.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts of this case bring it within the more comprehensive principle
that whenever a person is placed in such a position with regard
to another that it is obvious that, if he does not use due care in his own
conduct, he will cause injury to that person, the duty at once arises to
exercise care commensurate with the situation in which he thus finds
himself, and with which he is confronted, to avoid such danger; and
a negligent failure to perform the duty renders him liable for the
consequences of his neglect.</p>

<p class='c007'>This principle applies to varied situations arising from non-contract
relations. It protects the trespasser from wanton or wilful injury.
Its extends to the licensee, and requires the exercise of reasonable care
to avoid an unnecessary injury to him. It imposes upon the owner of
premises, which he expressly or impliedly invites persons to visit,
whether for the transaction of business or otherwise, the obligation to
keep the same in reasonably safe condition for use, though it does not
embrace those sentimental or social duties often prompting human
action. 21 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. (2d ed.) 471; Barrows, Neg. 3. Those
entering the premises of another by invitation are entitled to a higher
degree of care than those who are present by mere sufferance. Barrows,
Neg. 304. The rule stated is supported by a long list of authorities
both in England and this country, and is expressed in the familiar
maxim, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic utere tuo</span></i>,” etc. They will be found collected in the works
above cited, and also in 1 Thompson, Neg. (2d ed.), § 694. It is thus
stated in Heaven <em>v.</em> Pender, L. R. 11 Q. B. Div. 503: “The proposition
which these recognized cases suggest, and which is, therefore, to
be deduced from them, is that, whenever one person is by circumstances
placed in such a position with regard to another that every one
of ordinary sense who did think would at once recognize that if he did
not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct with regard to those
circumstances he would cause danger of injury to the person or property
of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid
such danger.” It applies with greater strictness to conduct towards
persons under disability, and imposes the obligation as a matter of
law, not mere sentiment, at least to refrain from any affirmative action
that might result in injury to them. A valuable note to Union Pacific
<em>v.</em> Cappier, 69 L. R. A. 513, discusses at length the character of the
duty and obligation of those coming into relation with sick and disabled
persons, and numerous analogous cases are collected and
analyzed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case at bar defendants were under no contract obligation to
minister to plaintiff in his distress; but humanity demanded that they
do so, if they understood and appreciated his condition. And, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>those acts which humanity demands are not always legal obligations,
the rule to which we have adverted applied to the relation existing
between these parties on this occasion and protected plaintiff from
acts at their hands that would expose him to personal harm. He was
not a trespasser upon their premises, but, on the contrary, was there
by the express invitation of Flatau, Sr. He was taken suddenly
ill while their guest, and the law, as well as humanity, required
that he be not exposed in his helpless condition to the merciless
elements.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case, in its substantial facts, is not unlike that of Cincinnati <em>v.</em>
Marrs’ Adm’x, 27 Ky. Law, 388, 85 S. W. 188, 70 L. R. A. 291. In
that case it appears that one Marrs was found asleep in the yards of
the railway company in an intoxicated condition. The yard employees
discovered him, aroused him from his stupor, and ordered him
off the tracks. They knew that he was intoxicated, and that he had
left a train recently arrived at the station, and he appeared to them
dazed and lost. About forty minutes later, while the yard employees
were engaged in switching, they ran over him and killed him. He had
again fallen asleep on one of the tracks. The court held the railway
company liable; that, under the circumstances disclosed, it was the
duty of the yard employees to see that Marrs was safely out of the
yards, or, in default of that, to exercise ordinary care to avoid injuring
him; and that it was reasonable to require them to anticipate his
probable continued presence in the yards. The case at bar is much
stronger, for here plaintiff was not intoxicated, nor a trespasser, but,
on the contrary, was in defendants’ house as their guest, and was there
taken suddenly ill in their presence, and, if his physical condition was
known and appreciated, they must have known that to compel him to
leave their home unattended would expose him to serious danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>We understand from the record that the learned trial court held in
harmony with the view of the law here expressed, but dismissed the
action for the reason, as stated in the memorandum denying a new
trial, that there was no evidence that either of the defendants knew,
or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known, plaintiff’s physical
condition, or that allowing him to proceed on his journey would
expose him to danger. Of course, to make the act of defendants a
violation of their duty in the premises, it should appear that they
knew and appreciated his serious condition. The evidence on this
feature of the case is not so clear as might be desired, but a majority
of the court are of opinion that it is sufficient to charge both defendants
with knowledge of plaintiff’s condition—at least, that the
question should have been submitted to the jury.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant Flatau, Sr., testified that he was in the room at all times
while plaintiff was in the house and observed his demeanor, and,
though he denied that plaintiff fell to the floor in a faint or otherwise,
yet the fact that plaintiff was seriously ill cannot be questioned.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Flatau, Jr., conducted him to his cutter, assisted him in, observed that
he was incapable of holding the reins to guide his team, and for that
reason threw them over his shoulders. If defendants knew and appreciated
his condition, their act in sending him out to make his way
to Madelia the best he could was wrongful and rendered them liable
in damages. We do not wish to be understood as holding that defendants
were under absolute duty to entertain plaintiff during the
night. Whether they could conveniently do so does not appear. What
they should or could have done in the premises can only be determined
from a full view of the evidence disclosing their situation, and
their facilities for communicating his condition to his friends, or near
neighbors, if any there were. All these facts will enable the jury to
determine whether, within the rules of negligence applicable to the
case, defendants neglected any duty they owed plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c019'>Every man is bound to assist those who have need of assistance, if he can
do it without exposing himself to sensible inconvenience. This obligation is
stronger in proportion as the danger is the greater for the one, and the trouble
of preserving him the less for the other. Such would be the case of a man
sleeping near the fire, and an individual seeing the clothes of the first catch
fire, and doing nothing towards extinguishing them: the crime would be
greater if he refrained from acting not simply from idleness, but from malice
or some pecuniary interest.</p>

<p class='c019'>The limits of the law on this head seem, however, to be capable of being extended
a good deal farther than they seem ever to have been extended hitherto.
In particular, in cases where the person is in danger, why should it not be
made the duty of every man to save another from mischief, when it can be
done without prejudicing himself, as well as to abstain from bringing it on
him. This accordingly is the idea pursued in the body of the work.<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c015'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>However, instead of having done too much in this respect, legislators have
not done enough. They ought to erect into an offence the refusal or the omission
of a service of humanity when it would be easy to render it, and when
some distinct ill clearly results from the refusal; such, for example, as abandoning
a wounded man in a solitary road without seeking any assistance for
him; not giving information to a man who is negligently meddling with
poisons; not reaching out the hand to one who has fallen into a ditch from
which he cannot extricate himself; in these, and other similar cases, could any
fault be found with a punishment, exposing the delinquent to a certain degree
of shame, or subjecting him to a pecuniary responsibility for the evil which he
might have prevented?</p>

does not; or if one who knows that a glass contains poison, sees him about

Morgan and McPherson, Indian Penal Code, 225, 226, notes.</p>

<p class='c019'>The first class of offences against the body consists of those offences which
affect human life; and highest in this first class stand those offences which fall
under the definition of voluntary culpable homicide.</p>

<p class='c019'>This important part of the law appears to us to require fuller explanation
than almost any other.</p>

<p class='c019'>The first point to which we wish to call the attention of his Lordship in
Council is the expression “omits what he is legally bound to do,” in the definition
of voluntary culpable homicide. These words, or other words tantamount
in effect, frequently recur in the Code. We think this the most
convenient place for explaining the reason which has led us so often to employ
them. For if that reason shall appear to be sufficient in cases in which human
life is concerned, it will <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</span></i> be sufficient in other cases.</p>

<p class='c019'>Early in the progress of the Code it became necessary for us to consider the
following question: When acts are made punishable on the ground that those
acts produce, or are intended to produce, or are known to be likely to produce
certain evil effects, to what extent ought omissions which produce, which are
intended to produce, or which are known to be likely to produce the same evil
effects to be made punishable?</p>

<p class='c019'>Two things we take to be evident: first, that some of these omissions ought
to be punished in exactly the same manner in which acts are punished: secondly,
that all these omissions ought not to be punished. It will hardly be disputed
that a jailer who voluntarily causes the death of a prisoner by omitting
to supply that prisoner with food, or a nurse who voluntarily causes the death
of an infant intrusted to her care by omitting to take it out of a tub of water
into which it has fallen, ought to be treated as guilty of murder. On the other
hand, it will hardly be maintained that a man should be punished as a murderer
because he omitted to relieve a beggar, even though there might be the
clearest proof that the death of the beggar was the result of the omission, and
that the man who omitted to give the alms knew that the death of the beggar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>was likely to be the effect of the omission. It will hardly be maintained that
a surgeon ought to be treated as a murderer for refusing to go from Calcutta
to Meerut to perform an operation, although it should be absolutely certain
that this surgeon was the only person in India who could perform it, and that
if it were not performed the person who required it would die. It is difficult
to say whether a Penal Code which should put no omissions on the same footing
with acts, or a Penal Code which should put all omissions on the same
footing with acts would produce consequences more absurd and revolting.
There is no country in which either of these principles is adopted. Indeed, it
is hard to conceive how, if either were adopted, society could be held together.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is plain, therefore, that a middle course must be taken. But it is not easy
to determine what that middle course ought to be. The absurdity of the two
extremes is obvious. But there are innumerable intermediate points; and
wherever the line of demarcation may be drawn it will, we fear, include some
cases which we might wish to exempt, and will exempt some which we might
wish to include.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Livingston’s Code provides that a person shall be considered as guilty
of homicide who omits to save life, which he could save “without personal
danger or pecuniary loss.” This rule appears to us to be open to serious objection.
There may be extreme inconvenience without the smallest personal
danger, or the smallest risk of pecuniary loss; as in the case which we lately
put of a surgeon summoned from Calcutta to Meerut to perform an operation.
He may be offered such a fee that he would be a gainer by going. He may
have no ground to apprehend that he should run any greater personal risk by
journeying to the Upper Provinces than by continuing to reside in Bengal.
But he is about to proceed to Europe immediately, or he expects some members
of his family by the next ship, and wishes to be at the presidency to
receive them. He, therefore, refuses to go. Surely, he ought not, for so refusing,
to be treated as a murderer. It would be somewhat inconsistent to punish
one man for not staying three months in India to save the life of another, and
to leave wholly unpunished a man who, enjoying ample wealth, should refuse
to disburse an anna to save the life of another. Again, it appears to us that it
may be fit to punish a person as a murderer for causing death by omitting an
act which cannot be performed without personal danger or pecuniary loss.
A parent may be unable to procure food for an infant without money. Yet
the parent, if he has the means, is bound to furnish the infant with food, and
if by omitting to do so he voluntarily causes its death, he may with propriety
be treated as a murderer. A nurse hired to attend a person suffering from an
infectious disease cannot perform her duty without running some risk of
infection. Yet if she deserts the sick person, and thus voluntarily causes his
death, we should be disposed to treat her as a murderer.</p>

<p class='c019'>We pronounce with confidence, therefore, that the line ought not to be
drawn where Mr. Livingston has drawn it. But it is with great diffidence that
we bring forward our own proposition. It is open to objections: cases may be
put in which it will operate too severely, and cases in which it will operate too
leniently; but we are unable to devise a better.</p>

<p class='c019'>What we propose is this, that where acts are made punishable on the ground
that they have caused, or have been intended to cause, or have been known to
be likely to cause a certain evil effect, omissions which have caused, which
have been intended to cause, or which have been known to be likely to cause
the same effect shall be punishable in the same manner; provided that such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>omissions were, on other grounds, illegal. An omission is illegal (see clause 28)
if it be an offence, if it be a breach of some direction of law, or if it be such a
wrong as would be a good ground for a civil action.</p>

<p class='c019'>We cannot defend this rule better than by giving a few illustrations of the
way in which it will operate. A omits to give Z food, and by that omission voluntarily
causes Z’s death. Is this murder? Under our rule it is murder if A
was Z’s jailer, directed by the law to furnish Z with food. It is murder if Z
was the infant child of A, and had therefore a legal right to sustenance, which
right a civil court would enforce against A. It is murder if Z was a bedridden
invalid, and A a nurse hired to feed Z. It is murder if A was detaining Z in
unlawful confinement, and had thus contracted (see clause 338) a legal obligation
to furnish Z, during the continuance of the confinement, with necessaries.
It is not murder if Z is a beggar who has no other claim on A than
that of humanity.</p>

<p class='c019'>A omits to tell Z that a river is swollen so high that Z cannot safely attempt
to ford it, and by this omission voluntarily causes Z’s death. This is murder
if A is a peon stationed by authority to warn travellers from attempting to
ford the river. It is murder if A is a guide who had contracted to conduct Z.
It is not murder if A is a person on whom Z has no other claim than that of
humanity.</p>

<p class='c019'>A savage dog fastens on Z; A omits to call off the dog, knowing that if the
dog be not called off it is likely that Z will be killed. Z is killed. This is
murder in A, if the dog belonged to A, inasmuch as his omission to take proper
order with the dog is illegal (clause 273). But if A be a mere passer-by it is
not murder.</p>

<p class='c019'>We are sensible that in some of the cases which we have put, our rule may
appear too lenient. But we do not think that it can be made more severe,
without disturbing the whole order of society. It is true that the man who,
having abundance of wealth, suffers a fellow creature to die of hunger at his
feet, is a bad man,—a worse man, probably, than many of those for whom we
have provided very severe punishment. But we are unable to see where, if we
make such a man legally punishable, we can draw the line. If the rich man
who refuses to save a beggar’s life at the cost of a little copper is a murderer, is
the poor man just one degree above beggary also to be a murderer if he omits
to invite the beggar to partake his hard-earned rice? Again, if the rich man is
a murderer for refusing to save the beggar’s life at the cost of a little copper,
is he also to be a murderer if he refuses to save the beggar’s life at the cost
of a thousand rupees? Suppose A to be fully convinced that nothing can save
Z’s life, unless Z leave Bengal and reside a year at the Cape, is A, however
wealthy he may be, to be punished as a murderer because he will not, at his
own expense, send Z to the Cape? Surely not. Yet it will be difficult to say
on what principle we can punish A for not spending an anna to save Z’s life,
and leave him unpunished for not spending a thousand rupees to save Z’s life.
The distinction between a legal and an illegal omission is perfectly plain and
intelligible. But the distinction between a large and a small sum of money is
very far from being so; not to say that a sum which is small to one man is
large to another.</p>

<p class='c019'>The same argument holds good in the case of the ford. It is true that none
but a very depraved man would suffer another to be drowned when he might
prevent it by a word. But if we punish such a man, where are we to stop?
How much exertion are we to require? Is a person to be a murderer if he does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>not go fifty yards through the sun of Bengal at noon in May in order to caution
a traveller against a swollen river? Is he to be a murderer if he does not
go a hundred yards?—if he does not go a mile?—if he does not go ten?
What is the precise amount of trouble and inconvenience which he is to endure?
The distinction between the guide who is bound to conduct the traveller
as safely as he can, and a mere stranger, is a clear distinction. But the distinction
between a stranger who will not give a halloo to save a man’s life, and
a stranger who will not run a mile to save a man’s life, is very far from being
equally clear.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is, indeed, most highly desirable that men should not merely abstain
from doing harm to their neighbours, but should render active services to their
neighbours. In general, however, the penal law must content itself with keeping
men from doing positive harm, and must leave to public opinion, and to
the teachers of morality and religion, the office of furnishing men with motives
for doing positive good. It is evident that to attempt to punish men by law
for not rendering to others all the service which it is their duty to render to
others would be preposterous. We must grant impunity to the vast majority
of those omissions which a benevolent morality would pronounce reprehensible,
and must content ourselves with punishing such omissions only when
they are distinguished from the rest by some circumstance which marks them
out as peculiarly fit objects of penal legislation. Now, no circumstance appears
to us so well fitted to be the mark as the circumstance which we have
selected. It will generally be found in the most atrocious cases of omission;
it will scarcely ever be found in a venial case of omission; and it is more clear
and certain than any other mark that has occurred to us. That there are
objections to the line which we propose to draw, we have admitted. But there
are objections to every line which can be drawn, and some line must be
drawn.</p>

<p class='c014'>Tort for the killing of a horse on a railroad by a locomotive engine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the trial, the plaintiff admitted that the horse must be considered
as trespassing upon the railroad, but contended and offered
evidence tending to show that by an exercise of proper care the injury
to the horse might have been avoided. The defendants offered evidence
to control this, and tending to show that they did all they reasonably
could do to stop their train before striking the horse. There
was no evidence of any wanton misconduct on their part.</p>

<p class='c007'>The counsel for the defendants contended and asked the presiding
judge to rule, that the defendants would not be liable, unless the plaintiff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>proved a reckless and wanton misconduct of their employees in
the management of the train when the horse was killed. The presiding
judge declined so to rule; but did rule that though the horse was
trespassing upon the defendants’ land at the time, the managers of the
train could not carelessly run over him, but were bound to use reasonable
care to avoid injuring him, and that if the jury found that by the
exercise of reasonable care they might have avoided injuring the
horse, they would be liable. The jury found for the plaintiff, and the
defendants alleged exceptions.<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c015'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Gray, C. J.</span> If the horse had been rightfully upon the defendants’
land, it would have been their duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid
injuring the horse. But it being admitted by the plaintiff that his
horse was trespassing upon the railroad, they did not owe him that
duty, and were not liable to him for anything short of a reckless and
wanton misconduct of those employed in the management of their
train. The defendants were therefore entitled to the instruction which
they requested. Tonawanda Railroad <em>v.</em> Munger, 5 Denio, 255; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span>

Met. (Ky.) 177.</p>

<p class='c007'>The instruction given to the jury held the defendants to the same
obligation to the plaintiff as if his horse had been rightfully on their
land; and made their paramount duty to the public of running the
train with proper speed and safety, and their use of the land set apart
and fitted for the performance of that duty, subordinate to the care of
private interests in property which was upon their track without
right.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some passages in the opinion in Eames <em>v.</em> Salem &amp; Lowell Railroad,
98 Mass. 560, 563, were relied on by the plaintiff’s counsel at the argument,
and apparently formed the basis of the rulings of the learned
judge in the Court below. But in that case there was no evidence of
any negligence or misconduct in the management of the train, and an
exact definition of the defendants’ liability, by reason of such negligence
or misconduct, was not required. In the present case such a
definition was requested by the defendants in appropriate terms, and
was refused, and for that refusal their</p>

<p class='c014'>Trespass on the Case for personal injuries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant was the possessor and manager of a tent show or circus.
On the afternoon of an exhibition plaintiff went inside the tent and
took a seat. There was a conflict of testimony as to whether plaintiff
was invited into the tent by an authorized agent of defendant, or
whether he entered without any invitation or other justification. A
feature of the entertainment consisted in the ignition and explosion
of a giant firecracker, attached to a pipe set in an upright position in
one of the show rings. Plaintiff sat thirty or forty feet from the place
where the cracker was exploded. At the explosion, part of the firecracker
flew and struck plaintiff in the eye, whereby he lost the sight
of his eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge left to the jury the question whether it was negligent in
defendant to explode this firecracker in the inside of the tent and in
the presence of the audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he gave, among others, the following instruction:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now you must further find, in order that the plaintiff recover,
that the plaintiff was in the tent, where he was injured, by the invitation
of some person having authority to allow him to go in there.
If he was a mere trespasser, who forced his way in, then the defendant
owed him no duty that would enable him to recover under the
declaration and proofs in this case.”...</p>

faulty, in so far as it was intended to preclude recovery in any
event if the plaintiff was found to be a trespasser. It is true that a
trespasser who suffers an injury because of a dangerous condition of
premises is without remedy. But, where a trespasser is discovered
upon the premises by the owner or occupant, he is not beyond the
pale of the law, and any negligence resulting in injury will render the
person guilty of negligence liable to respond in damages. Beach,

servant was committed after the audience was made up. The
presence of plaintiff was known, and the danger to him from a negligent
act was also known. The question of whether a dangerous experiment
should be attempted in his presence, or whether an experiment
should be conducted with due care and regard to his safety, cannot be
made to depend upon whether he had forced himself into the tent.
Every instinct of humanity revolts at such a suggestion.</p>

<p class='c014'>Error to the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County, reserved
in the District Court.<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c015'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff below, Richard Smith, sued the defendant below, the
Cincinnati &amp; Zanesville Railroad Company, to recover the value of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>two horses alleged to have been killed through the negligence of the
servants of the defendant in operating one of its trains. The inclosure
of the plaintiff adjoined the railroad of the defendant; and from this
inclosure, on the night on which the horses were killed, they escaped
on to the railroad.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court, among other things, charged the jury as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant’s servants in this case were not bound to use extraordinary
care or extraordinary means to save the plaintiff’s horses.
But they were bound to use what, in that peculiar business, is ordinary
care and diligence; and if the loss of the horses was the result
of a want of that ordinary care and diligence, the defendant is
liable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant had the right to the free and unobstructed use of its
railroad track. And the paramount duty of the employees is the protection
of the passengers and property in the train, and the train
itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this being their paramount duty, they are bound to use ordinary
care and diligence, so as not unnecessarily to injure the property
of others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the circumstances of the case, could and would reasonably
prudent men, skilled in that kind of business, keeping in view as their
paramount duty the protection and safety of the train, its passengers,
and the property on and about it intrusted to their care, in the exercise
of ordinary care have stopped the train and saved the horses?
If so, and the defendant’s servants did not so act, the defendant is
liable in this case; otherwise the defendant is not liable.</p>

<p class='c007'>In considering the paramount duty of the employees in the proper
management of the train for the safety of passengers and property of
its train, you have a right to determine whether they have other duties
to perform. It is claimed the engineer had other duties than watching
the track to perform, which were necessary for the safety of the passengers
and property of the train,—such as gauging his steam, watching
time-table, regulating his supply of water, examining his machinery,
watching for the station-signal, etc. If such were the case,
he had a lawful right to perform these duties, and was not bound to
neglect them to save the plaintiff’s horses, nor bound to watch the
track while performing these duties. They were only bound, under
the circumstances of the case, to use ordinary care and diligence to
save the horses,—the safety of the passengers and property of the
train being their paramount duty; and if the jury find from the evidence
that the persons in charge of the engine were attending to the
duties of the train approaching the station at the time of the accident,
these duties were paramount to watching the track for trespassing
animals; and if the horses were not, on that account, discovered in
time to save them by using ordinary means to stop the train, the
defendant is not liable.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>It is claimed by the defendant’s counsel that off the crossings of the
railroad the servants of the railroad company have a right to presume
that there are no trespassers on the roadway; that they are not bound
to look out for trespassers except for the safety of passengers or property
in charge. It is also claimed that inasmuch as the road at the
place where the plaintiff’s horses got on the track and were killed was
fenced, on that account the defendant’s servants in charge of the
train were not bound to look out for trespassing stock. Upon this
question I only can charge you this: That if the railroad was fenced
at the place where the horses got on and were killed, and this was
known to the defendant’s employees, you have a right to look to that
circumstance as reflecting upon and in determining whether the employees
exercised ordinary care in the management of the train. But
if they might, in the exercise of ordinary care, have discovered the
animals, although they were trespassers on the roadway, other than
at a crossing, in time to have prevented their destruction, it was their
duty to do so; and if from such want of ordinary care they were not
discovered in time to prevent their destruction, the defendant is
liable for their loss to the plaintiff.<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c015'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>White</span>, J. The whole charge is set out in the bill of exceptions.
Considering its several parts in connection, and giving to the whole
a fair construction, we deem it necessary only to notice two particulars
in which it is objected to.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are: 1. Whether the fact that the horses were trespassing on
the track excused the servants of the defendant from the exercise of
ordinary care; and, 2. Whether that fact, and the additional one
that the road was fenced, excused the engineer, as respects the owner
of stray animals, from looking ahead to see whether such animals were
on the track or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>In regard to the first of these particulars, it is contended on behalf
of the railroad company that, as the horses were trespassing
on the railroad, the company was exempt from using ordinary care
to save them, and that it was only liable for what is called gross
negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court instructed the jury that the defendant had the right to
the free and unobstructed use of its railroad track, and that the paramount
duty of its employees was the protection of the passengers
and property in the train, and the train itself. But this being their
paramount duty, they were bound to use ordinary care and diligence
so as not unnecessarily to injure the property of others.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think the charge stated the law correctly. We see no good reason,
in principle, why a party, so far as may be consistent with the full
enjoyment of his own rights, ought not to use ordinary care so as not
unnecessarily to injure the property of others.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>It is true, the rule contended for by the counsel of the plaintiff in
error is sustained by a number of authorities. But the later and
better considered cases are to the contrary. Illinois Central R. R. Co.
<em>v.</em> Middlesworth, 46 Ill. 494; Bemis <em>v.</em> Conn., &amp;c. R. R., 42 Vt. 375;
Isbell <em>v.</em> N. Y. R. R. Co., 27 Conn. 393; Redfield’s American Railway
Cases, 355, 356.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rule contended for has never been adopted in this State. It
is, moreover, as respects railroad companies, inconsistent with our
statute law on the subject. S. &amp; C. 331.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts in the case of the C. H. &amp; D. R. R. Co. <em>v.</em> Waterson &amp;
Kirk, 4 Ohio St. 424, cited and relied upon by the counsel of the plaintiff
in error, were different from those in the case now before us, and
we do not regard the rule there laid down as to the liability of the
company in that case as applicable to this.</p>

<p class='c007'>From what has been said of the charge in the first particular named,
it would seem to follow that it is unobjectionable as respects the
second. If it was the duty of the servants of the company, so far as
was consistent with their other and paramount duties, to use ordinary
care to avoid injuring animals on the track, they were, of course,
bound to adopt the ordinary precautions to discover danger, as well
as to avoid its consequences after it became known.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact that the road was fenced at the place of collision with the
horses, was a circumstance to be considered in connection with the
other circumstances of the case in determining whether the engineer
was guilty of negligence in not looking ahead and discovering the
danger in time to avoid it. The fact that the road was fenced rendered
it less probable that wandering animals would be on the track;
but it cannot be said that the engineer, as a matter of law, by reason
of the fences, was wholly excused from keeping a lookout ahead of the
train.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the servants of the company in charge of the train, having due
regard to their duties for the safety of the persons and property in
their charge, could, by the exercise of ordinary care, have seen and
saved the horses, we think they were bound to have done so. Bemis

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Seaman, J.</span><a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c015'><sup>[130]</sup></a> The plaintiff at the time of his injury was neither in
the relation of passenger nor of one in a public crossing or place in
which the public were licensed to travel, but upon the undisputed facts
was a mere intruder on the tracks of the defendant, technically a trespasser;
and this record excludes any of the elements of implied license
or invitation to such use which have given rise to much discussion and
diversity of views in the courts. Therefore the inquiry is here squarely
presented, What is the duty which a railway company owes to a trespasser
on its tracks, and how and when does the duty arise? The
decisions upon this subject uniformly recognize that the trespasser
cannot be treated as an outlaw; and at the least that, if wantonly
injured in the operation of the railroad, the company is answerable in
damages. Clearly, then, an obligation is placed upon the company
to exercise some degree of care when the danger becomes apparent.
Is it, however, bound to foresee or assume that rational beings will
thus enter as trespassers in a place of danger, and to exercise in the
running of its trains the constant vigilance in view of that probability
which is imposed for public crossings? There are cases which would
seem to hold this strict requirement (see note, 1 Thompson on Negligence
(1880), 448; East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad Co. <em>v.</em>
St. John, 5 Sneed, 524); but by the great preponderance of authority,
in this country and in England, the more reasonable doctrine is pronounced,
in effect, as follows: That the railroad company has the
right to a free track in such places; that it is not bound to any act or
service in anticipation of trespassers thereon; and that the trespasser
who ventures to enter upon a track for any purpose of his own assumes
all risks of the conditions which may be found there, including the
operation of engines and cars. Wright <em>v.</em> Boston and Maine Railroad,
129 Mass. 440; Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company <em>v.</em>
Hummell, 44 Penn. St. 375. The decision by this court, in Cleveland,
Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway Company <em>v.</em> Philips’
Administrator (1), 24 U. S. Appeals, 489, adopts the view held in this
line of cases, citing the authorities of which repetition here is unnecessary.
The same doctrine prevails in Minnesota, where the injury in
question arose. Johnson <em>v.</em> Truesdale, 46 Minnesota, 345; Studley
<em>v.</em> St. Paul &amp; Duluth R. Co., 48 Minnesota, 249. In the latter case it
was held that there could be no recovery “unless the engineer saw the
girl in time to avoid the accident, and then was guilty of such gross
negligence in not trying to avoid it as to evince a reckless disregard of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>human life;” and the opinion gives this further exposition of the rule:
“The defendant’s engineer was under no obligation to anticipate a
trespasser, or to look out for persons walking upon the track; but,
upon discovering plaintiff’s intestate across the cattle-guard, as he
claims she was when he noticed that she was in danger, it became the
engineer’s duty to use proper care to avoid running her down. If he
failed to exercise proper care, he would necessarily be grossly negligent
and evince a reckless disregard of human life.” So in Wisconsin, in
Anderson <em>v.</em> Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company,
87 Wisconsin, 195, 204, it is said: “The use of a railroad is exclusively
for its owners or those acting under its authority, and the
company is not bound to the exercise of any active duty of care or
diligence towards mere trespassers upon its track, to keep a lookout to
discover or protect them from injury, except that, when discovered in
a position of danger or peril, it is its duty to use all reasonable and
proper effort to save and protect them from the probable consequences
of their indiscretion or negligence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The well-established and just rule which holds the railroad company
to the exercise of constant and strict care against injury through
its means is applicable only to the relation on which it is founded, of
an existing duty or obligation. This active or positive duty arises in
favor of the public at a street crossing or other place at which it is
presumable that persons or teams may be met. It is not material, so
far as concerns this inquiry, whether the place is one for which a lawful
right of passage exists, as it is the fact of notice to the company
arising out of its existence and the probability of its use which imposes
the positive duty to exercise care; the requirement of an extreme
degree of care being superadded because of the hazards which
attend the operations of the company. The case of a trespasser on
the track in a place not open to travel is clearly distinguishable in the
absence of this notice to the company. There is no constructive
notice upon which to base the obligation of constant lookout for his
presence there, and no actual notice up to the moment the trainmen
have discovered the fact of his peril. As that peril comes wholly from
his unauthorized act and temerity, the risk and all positive duty of
care for his safety rest with the trespasser. The obligation of the
company and its operatives is not then preëxisting, but arises at the
moment of discovery, and is negative in its nature,—a duty which
is common to human conduct to make all reasonable effort to avert
injury to others from means which can be controlled.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the issue presented here. It excludes all inquiry respecting
the character of the roadbed, cattle-guard, locomotive, brake appliances
or other means of operation, or of the speed or manner of running
the train up to the moment of notice, because no breach of
positive duty is involved. It is confined to the evidence relating to
the discovery by the engineer and fireman of the plaintiff’s peril and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>to the efforts then made to avert the injury; and out of that to ascertain
whether, in any view which may justly be taken, it is shown that
these men or the engineer in disregard of the duty which then confronted
them neglected to employ with reasonable promptness the
means at hand for stopping the train.<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c015'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Brett, M. R., in HEAVEN</span> <em>v.</em> PENDER<br /> (1883) <cite>11 Queen’s Bench Division, 503, 506, 507.</cite></h5>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Brett, M. R.</span>... The action is in form and substance an action
for negligence. That the stage was, through want of attention of the
defendant’s servants, supplied in a state unsafe for use is not denied.
But want of attention amounting to a want of ordinary care is not a
good cause of action, although injury ensue from such want, unless
the person charged with such want of ordinary care had a duty to the
person complaining to use ordinary care in respect of the matter called
in question. Actionable negligence consists in the neglect of the use
of ordinary care or skill towards a person to whom the defendant
owes the duty of observing ordinary care and skill, by which neglect
the plaintiff, without contributory negligence on his part, has suffered
injury to his person or property. The question in this case is whether
the defendant owed such a duty to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Mitchell, J.</span> Actionable negligence is the failure to discharge a
legal duty to the person injured. If there is no duty, there is no negligence.
Even if a defendant owes a duty to some one else, but does not
owe it to the person injured, no action will lie. The duty must be due
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>to the person injured. These principles are elementary, and are
equally applicable, whether the duty is imposed by positive statute
or is founded on general common-law principles.<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c015'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'>LARY <em>v.</em> CLEVELAND R. CO.<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Indiana, November Term, 1881.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 78 Indiana Reports, 323.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Lary sued the railroad company for damage alleged to have been
sustained by him, through the negligent failure of the company to
repair a building standing on its grounds, and formerly used by it as
a freight house. Answer, a general denial. Upon the trial, the plaintiff
introduced his evidence; the defendant demurred to it, and the
plaintiff joined in demurrer. The Court sustained the demurrer, and
the plaintiff excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts which the plaintiff’s evidence tended to prove are substantially
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The railroad company owned half an acre of land between the railroad
track and a highway. On this land was a building erected several
years before for a freight house. It was no longer used as the
general freight house, though still used for storing the company’s
wood. A part of the roof of the building was off, and had been so for
some months. The plaintiff, who was twenty years of age, was in the
habit of passing the building almost daily, and had noticed that part
of the roof was off. In a rain storm, the plaintiff went under the platform
of the old freight house, and played there with other young
people. A piece of the roof was torn off by the wind. The plaintiff,
being frightened at the noise, ran out, saw the piece of the roof in the
air, and ran towards the highway; but before or as he reached the
edge of it, this fragment of the roof fell upon him.<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c015'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Morris, C.</span> [After stating the case.] Upon the facts thus stated,
can the appellant maintain this action?</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no testimony tending to show that the appellant was at the
freight house by the invitation of the appellee, nor that he was there
for the purpose of transacting any business with the appellee. The appellant
intruded upon the premises of the appellee, and is not, therefore,
entitled to that protection which one, expressly or by implication,
invited into the house or place of business of another, is entitled to.
The appellant was a trespasser, and as such he entered upon the appellee’s
premises, taking the risks of all the mere omissions of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>appellee as to the condition of the grounds and buildings thus invaded
without leave. We do not wish to be understood as holding or implying
that if, on the part of the appellee, there had been any act done
implying a willingness to inflict the injury upon the appellant, it would
not be liable. But we think there is nothing in the evidence from
which such an inference can be reasonably drawn. The building
could be seen by all; its condition was open to the inspection of every
one; it had been abandoned as a place for the transaction of public
business; it was in a state of palpable and visible decay, and no one
was authorized, impliedly or otherwise, to go into or under it. Under
such circumstances, the law says to him who intrudes into such a
place, that he must proceed at his own risk.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of The Pittsburgh, &amp;c. R. W. Co. <em>v.</em> Bingham, 29 Ohio
St. 364, the question was: “Is a railroad company bound to exercise
ordinary care and skill in the erection, structure, or maintenance of
its station house or houses, as to persons who enter or are at the same,
not on any business with the company or its agents, nor on any business
connected with the operation of its road; but are there without
objection by the company, and therefore by its mere sufferance or
permission?” The Court answered this question in the negative.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of Hounsell <em>v.</em> Smyth, 7 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 731, the plaintiff
fell into a quarry, left open and unguarded on the unenclosed lands
of the defendant, over which the public were permitted to travel; it
was held that the owner was under no legal obligation to fence or
guard the excavation unless it was so near the public road as to render
travel thereon dangerous. That the person so travelling over such
waste lands must take the permission with its concomitant conditions,
and, it may be, perils. Hardcastle <em>v.</em> The South Yorkshire R. W. Co.,
4 H. &amp; N. 67; Sweeny <em>v.</em> Old Colony, &amp;c. R. R. Co., 10 Allen, 368;
Knight <em>v.</em> Abert, 6 Barr, 472.</p>

<p class='c007'>After reviewing the above and other cases, Judge Boynton, in the
case of The Pittsburgh, &amp;c. R. W. Co. <em>v.</em> Bingham, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, says:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The principle underlying the cases above cited recognizes the right
of the owner of real property to the exclusive use and enjoyment of
the same without liability to others for injuries occasioned by its unsafe
condition, where the person receiving the injury was not in or near
the place of danger by lawful right; and where such owner assumed
no responsibility for his safety by inviting him there, without giving
him notice of the existence or imminence of the peril to be avoided.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case from which we have quoted, the intestate of the plaintiff
was at the defendant’s station house, not on any business with it,
but merely to pass away his time, when, by a severe and sudden blast
of wind, a portion of the roof of the station house was blown off the
building and against the intestate, with such force as to kill him. The
case, in its circumstances, was not unlike the one before us. Nicholson
<em>v.</em> Erie R. W. Co., 41 N. Y. 525; Murray <em>v.</em> McLean, 57 Ill. 378;
Durham <em>v.</em> Musselman, 2 Blackf. 96 (18 Am. Dec. 133).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>In the case of Sweeny <em>v.</em> Old Colony, &amp;c. R. R. Co., 10 Allen, 368,
the Court say:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“A licensee, who enters on premises by permission only, without
any enticement, allurement, or inducement being held out to him by
the owner or occupant, cannot recover damages for injuries caused by
obstructions or pitfalls. He goes there at his own risk, and enjoys the
license subject to its concomitant perils.” Carleton <em>v.</em> Franconia Iron
and Steel Co., 99 Mass. 216; Harris <em>v.</em> Stevens, 31 Vt. 79, 90; Wood <em>v.</em>
Leadbitter, 13 M. &amp; W. 838.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evidence in this case brings it, we think, within the principles
settled by the above cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appellant contends that the evidence shows that the appellee
was guilty of gross negligence in not repairing its freight house, and
that such negligence renders it liable, though he entered upon its
premises without invitation or license, as a mere intruder, and was,
while such intruder, injured; and, in support of this proposition, we
are referred to the following cases: Lafayette, &amp;c. R. R. Co. <em>v.</em> Adams,
26 Ind. 76; Indianapolis, &amp;c. R. R. Co. <em>v.</em> McClure, 26 Ind. 370; Gray
<em>v.</em> Harris, 107 Mass. 492; Isabel <em>v.</em> Hannibal, &amp;c. R. R. Co., 60 Mo.
475.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first of the above cases, the Court held that, where the negligence
of the company was so gross as to imply a disregard of consequences
or a willingness to inflict the injury, it was liable, though the
party injured was not free from fault. In the second case, it was held
that a railroad company, not required to fence its road, would not be
liable for animals killed on its road, unless guilty of gross negligence.
The phrase “gross negligence,” as used in these cases, means something
more than the mere omission of duty; it meant, as shown by the
evidence in the cases, reckless and aggressive conduct on the part of
the company’s servants. “Something more than negligence, however
gross, must be shown, to enable a party to recover for an injury,
when he has been guilty of contributory negligence.” The Pennsylvania
Co. <em>v.</em> Sinclair, 62 Ind. 301. There was, in the cases referred to
in 26 Ind., something more than negligence. As in the case of The
Indianapolis, &amp;c. R. W. Co. <em>v.</em> McBrown, 46 Ind. 229, where the
animal was driven through a deep cut, eighty rods long, into and upon
a trestle work of the company, there was aggressive malfeasance. In
the Massachusetts case, the Court held that a party building a dam
across a stream must provide against unusual floods. We do not think
these cases applicable to the one before us.</p>

<p class='c007'>There could be no negligence on the part of the appellee, of which
the appellant can be heard to complain, unless at the time he received
the injury, the appellee was under some obligation or duty to him to
repair its freight house. “Actionable negligence exists only where
the one whose act causes or occasions the injury owes to the injured
person a duty, created either by contract or by operation of law, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>he has failed to discharge.” Pittsburgh, &amp;c. R. W. Co. <em>v.</em> Bingham,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>; Burdeck <em>v.</em> Cheadle, 26 Ohio St. 393; Town of Salem <em>v.</em> Goller,
76 Ind. 291. We have shown that the appellee owed the appellant no
such duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judgment below should be affirmed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Per Curiam.</span> It is ordered, upon the foregoing opinion, that the

<h5 class='c013'>BUCH <em>v.</em> AMORY MANUFACTURING CO.<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New Hampshire, December, 1897.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 69 New Hampshire Reports, 257.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Case. Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. March 30, 1886,
the plaintiff, then eight years of age and unable to speak or understand
English, was injured by the machinery in operation in the defendants’
mill. The evidence tended to show that the plaintiff’s
brother, who was thirteen years of age, was employed as a back-boy
in the mule-spinning room, and that at his request the plaintiff went
into the room for the purpose of learning the work of a back-boy.
The elder brother had no authority to request or permit the plaintiff
to go into the mill or to instruct him, unless it could be inferred from
the fact testified to by him that “he saw other boys taking their
brothers to learn, as he understood from their motions.” The plaintiff
was in the mill for a day and a half until the accident, openly
assisting more or less in the work of the back-boys. He testified that
he was directed by a person not the overseer of the room, whom he
saw “bossing” the other boys, to pick up some bobbins and put some
waste in a box. There was evidence tending to show that Fulton, the
overseer, who was in charge of and hired the back-boys and other
operatives in the room, passed in the alleys near the plaintiff, and that
he was well acquainted with his help. He testified that he had no
knowledge of the plaintiff’s presence in the room until about two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>hours before the accident, when, aware that the boy was not an employee,
he directed him to go out, and thinking he might not understand
English, took him to an operative who spoke the plaintiff’s
language, whom he told to send the plaintiff out. The plaintiff testified
that Fulton spoke to him and, as he understood, directed him
to remove his vest, but that he did not understand he was ordered to
leave. There was no evidence except Fulton’s that the order was
communicated to the plaintiff or understood by him. There was no
evidence or claim that the machinery was improperly constructed or
operated, or that it was out of repair. The plaintiff’s hand was caught
in a gearing which the back-boys were instructed to avoid, but there
was no evidence that the plaintiff was given any instruction or warning
whatever. There was evidence tending to prove that boys under
thirteen years of age were not employed in the room, and that the
place and machinery were dangerous for a child of the plaintiff’s age.
Subject to exception, a motion that a verdict be directed for the
defendants was denied.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Carpenter, C. J.</span> On the evidence, the jury could not properly
find that the plaintiff was upon the premises of the defendants with
their consent or permission. Although there was evidence tending to
show that other back-boys had taken their brothers into the room for
the purpose of instructing them in the business, there was no sufficient
evidence that the fact that they did so was known to the defendants,
and there was evidence that on the first occasion brought to their
knowledge they objected. Upon this state of the evidence, a license
by the defendants—whether material or immaterial—for the
plaintiff’s presence in the room could not legitimately be inferred.
The plaintiff was a trespasser.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant’s machinery was in perfect order and properly managed.
They were conducting their lawful business in a lawful way
and in the usual and ordinary manner. During the plaintiff’s presence
they made no change in the operation of their works or in their
method of doing business. No immediate or active intervention on
their part caused the injury. It resulted from the joint operation of
the plaintiff’s conduct and the ordinary and usual condition of the
premises. Under these circumstances, an adult in full possession of
his faculties, or an infant capable of exercising the measure of care
necessary to protect himself from the dangers of the situation, whether
he was on the premises by permission or as a trespasser, could not
recover.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff was an infant of eight years. The particular circumstances
of the accident—how or in what manner it happened that
the plaintiff caught his hand in the gearing—are not disclosed by
the case. It does not appear that any evidence was offered tending to
show that he was incapable of knowing the danger from putting his
hand in contact with the gearing, or of exercising a measure of care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>sufficient to avoid the danger. Such an incapacity cannot be presumed.
Stone <em>v.</em> Railroad, 115 N. Y. 104, 109–111; Hayes <em>v.</em> Norcross,
162 Mass. 546, 548; Mulligan <em>v.</em> Curtis, 100 Mass. 512, 514;
Cosgrove <em>v.</em> Ogden, 49 N. Y. 255, 258; Kunz <em>v.</em> Troy, 104 N. Y. 344,
351; Lovett <em>v.</em> Railroad, 9 Allen, 557, 563.</p>

<p class='c007'>An infant is bound to use the reason he possesses and to exercise
the degree of care and caution of which he is capable. If the plaintiff
could by the due exercise of his intellectual and physical powers have
avoided the injury, he is no more entitled to recover than an adult
would be under the same circumstances. The burden was upon him,
and the case might be disposed of upon the ground that he adduced
no evidence tending to show that he had not sufficient reason and discretion
to appreciate the particular risk of injury that he incurred and
to avoid it. But it may be that evidence tending to show the plaintiff’s
incapacity was adduced, and that the case is silent on the subject
because this particular question was not made by the defendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Assuming, then, that the plaintiff was incapable either of appreciating
the danger or of exercising the care necessary to avoid it, is he,
upon the facts stated, entitled to recover? He was a trespasser in a
place dangerous to children of his age. In the conduct of their business
and management of their machinery the defendants were without
fault. The only negligence charged upon or attributed to them
is that, inasmuch as they could not make the plaintiff understand a
command to leave the premises and ought to have known that they
could not, they did not forcibly eject him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Actionable negligence is the neglect of a legal duty. The defendants
are not liable unless they owed to the plaintiff a legal duty which
they neglected to perform. With purely moral obligations the law
does not deal. For example, the priest and Levite who passed by on
the other side were not, it is supposed, liable at law for the continued
suffering of the man who fell among thieves, which they might and
morally ought to have prevented or relieved. Suppose A, standing
close by a railroad, sees a two-year-old babe on the track and a car
approaching. He can easily rescue the child with entire safety to
himself, and the instincts of humanity require him to do so. If he
does not, he may, perhaps, justly be styled a ruthless savage and a
moral monster; but he is not liable in damages for the child’s injury,
or indictable under the statute for its death. P. S., c. 278, s. 8.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In dealing with cases which involve injuries to children, courts&#160;... have sometimes strangely confounded legal obligation with sentiments
that are independent of law.” Indianapolis <em>v.</em> Emmelman,
108 Ind. 530. “It is important to bear in mind, in actions for injuries
to children, a very simple and fundamental fact, which in this class of
cases is sometimes strangely lost sight of, viz., that no action arises
without a breach of duty.” 2 Thomp. Neg. 1183, note 3. “No action
will lie against a spiteful man, who, seeing another running into danger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>merely omits to warn him. To bring the case within the category
of actionable negligence some wrongful act must be shown, or a breach
of some positive duty; otherwise, a man who allows strangers to roam
over his property would be held answerable for not protecting them
against any danger they might encounter whilst using the license.”
Gautret <em>v.</em> Egerton, L. R. 2 C. P. 371, 375.</p>

<p class='c007'>What duties do the owners owe to a trespasser upon their premises?
They may eject him, using such force and such only as is necessary
for the purpose. They are bound to abstain from any other or further
intentional or negligent acts of personal violence,—bound to inflict
upon him by means of their own active intervention no injury which
by due care they can avoid. They are not bound to warn him against
hidden or secret dangers arising from the condition of the premises
(Redigan <em>v.</em> Railroad, 155 Mass. 44, 47, 48), or to protect him against
any injury that may arise from his own acts or those of other persons.
In short, if they do nothing, let him entirely alone, in no manner interfere
with him, he can have no cause of action against them for any
injury that he may receive. On the contrary, he is liable to them for
any damage that he by his unlawful meddling may cause them or their
property. What greater or other legal obligation was cast on these
defendants by the circumstance that the plaintiff was (as is assumed)
an irresponsible infant?</p>

<p class='c007'>If landowners are not bound to warn an adult trespasser of hidden
dangers,—dangers which he by ordinary care cannot discover and,
therefore, cannot avoid,—on what ground can it be claimed that
they must warn an infant of open and visible dangers which he is unable
to appreciate? No legal distinction is perceived between the
duties of the owners in one case and the other. The situation of the
adult in front of secret dangers which by no degree of care he can discover,
and that of the infant incapable of comprehending danger, is
in a legal aspect exactly the same. There is no apparent reason for
holding that any greater or other duty rests upon the owners in one
case than in the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a wide difference—a broad gulf—both in reason and in
law, between causing and preventing an injury; between doing by
negligence or otherwise a wrong to one’s neighbor, and preventing him
from injuring himself; between protecting him against injury by
another and guarding him from injury that may accrue to him from
the condition of the premises which he has unlawfully invaded. The
duty to do no wrong is a legal duty. The duty to protect against
wrong is, generally speaking and excepting certain intimate relations
in the nature of a trust, a moral obligation only, not recognized or
enforced by law. Is a spectator liable if he sees an intelligent man or
an unintelligent infant running into danger and does not warn or
forcibly restrain him? What difference does it make whether the
danger is on another’s land, or upon his own, in case the man or infant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>is not there by his express or implied invitation? If A sees an
eight-year-old boy beginning to climb into his garden over a wall
stuck with spikes and does not warn him or drive him off, is he liable
in damages if the boy meets with injury from the spikes? Degg <em>v.</em>
Railway, 1 H. &amp; N. 773, 777. I see my neighbor’s two-year-old babe
in dangerous proximity to the machinery of his windmill in his yard,
and easily might, but do not, rescue him. I am not liable in damages
to the child for his injuries, nor, if the child is killed, punishable for
manslaughter by the common law or under the statute (P. S., c. 278,
s. 8), because the child and I are strangers, and I am under no legal
duty to protect him. Now suppose I see the same child trespassing
in my own yard and meddling in like manner with the dangerous
machinery of my own windmill. What additional obligation is cast
upon me by reason of the child’s trespass? The mere fact that the
child is unable to take care of himself does not impose on me the legal
duty of protecting him in the one case more than in the other. Upon
what principle of law can an infant by coming unlawfully upon my
premises impose upon me the legal duty of a guardian? None has
been suggested, and we know of none.</p>

<p class='c007'>An infant, no matter of how tender years, is liable in law for his
trespasses. 1 Ch. Pl. 86; 2 Kent, 241; Cool. Torts, 103; Poll. Torts,
46; 2 Add. Torts, 1126, 1153; 10 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 668, et seq.;
Humphrey <em>v.</em> Douglass, 10 Vt. 71; School District <em>v.</em> Bragdon, 23
N. H. 507; Eaton <em>v.</em> Hill, 50 N. H. 235; Bullock <em>v.</em> Babcock, 3 Wend.
391; Williams <em>v.</em> Hays, 143 N. Y. 442, 446–451; Conklin <em>v.</em> Thompson,
29 Barb. 218; Neal <em>v.</em> Gillett, 23 Conn. 437; Huchting <em>v.</em> Engel, 17
Wis. 237. If, then, the defendants’ machinery was injured by the
plaintiff’s act in putting his hand in the gearing, he is liable to them
for the damages in an action of trespass and to nominal damages for
the wrongful entry. It would be no answer to such an action that the
defendants might by force have prevented the trespass. It is impossible
to hold that while the plaintiff is liable to the defendants in trespass,
they are liable to him in case for neglecting to prevent the act
which caused the injury both to him and them. Cases of enticement,
allurement, or invitation of infants to their injury, or setting traps for
them, and cases relating to the sufficiency of public ways, or to the
exposure upon them of machinery attractive and dangerous to children
have no application here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Danger from machinery in motion in the ordinary course of business
cannot be distinguished from that arising from a well, pit, open
scuttle, or other stationary object. The movement of the works is a
part of the regular and normal condition of the premises. Sullivan <em>v.</em>
Railroad, 156 Mass. 378; Holbrook <em>v.</em> Aldrich, 168 Mass. 15; Rodgers
<em>v.</em> Lees, 140 Pa. St. 475. The law no more compels the owners to shut
down their gates and stop their business for the protection of a trespasser
than it requires them to maintain a railing about an open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>scuttle or to fence in their machinery for the same purpose. Benson
<em>v.</em> Company, 77 Md. 535; Mergenthaler <em>v.</em> Kirby, 79 Md. 182. There
was no evidence tending to show that the defendants neglected to perform
any legal duty to the plaintiff. McGuiness <em>v.</em> Butler, 159 Mass.

<h5 class='c013'>KEFFE <em>v.</em> MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY CO.<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Minnesota, January 11, 1875.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 21 Minnesota Reports, 207.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>The plaintiff, an infant, brought this action in the Court of Common
Pleas for Ramsey County to recover damages for injuries sustained
while playing upon a turn-table of defendant. The circumstances
under which plaintiff was injured are thus stated in the
complaint: “That in connection with said railroad” [of defendant]
“defendant, before and up to the month of October, 1867, used and
operated a certain turn-table, located on the lands of said defendant
in said town of Northfield, which said turn-table was so constructed
and arranged as to be easily turned around and made to revolve in a
horizontal direction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After minutely describing the turn-table, the complaint proceeds:
“That said turn-table was situated in a public place, near to a passenger
depot of the defendant, and within 120 feet from the residence
and home of plaintiff. That said turn-table was unfastened and in no
way protected, fenced, guarded, or enclosed, to prevent it from being
turned around at the pleasure of small children, although the same
could at all times be readily locked and securely fastened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That said turn-table&#160;... was in the possession and under the
control of defendant, and not necessary in operating said railroad and
it was the duty of said defendant to keep said turn-table fastened or
in some way protected, so that children could not readily have access
thereto and revolve the same. That the same was not so protected or
fastened, and that said turn-table, when left unfastened, was very
attractive to young children, and that while the same was being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>moved by children, and at all times when left unfastened, it was
dangerous to persons upon or near it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That defendant had notice of all the aforesaid facts before and at
the time the injury herein named occurred to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That plaintiff, on September 11, 1867, was a child of tender years,
without judgment or discretion, he being at that date seven years old,
and that in consequence of the carelessness, negligence, and improper
conduct of said defendant, in not locking, enclosing, or otherwise
fastening said turn-table, and by the negligence, carelessness, and improper
conduct of said defendant, its agents, and servants, in allowing
said turn-table to be and remain unfastened, insecure, and improperly
put in motion, it was, at the date last aforesaid, revolved by other
children, over whom the parents and guardians of plaintiff had no
control, and without their knowledge, and, while being so revolved, the
plaintiff, being on said turn-table, had his right leg caught near the
knee, between the surface of said turn-table and said abutment or wall,
and between the iron rail on said turn-table and the iron rail on said
abutment or wall, and said leg was thereby so bruised, broken, mangled,
and fractured, as to render amputation necessary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The complaint further alleges that the injury was caused by defendant’s
negligence, and without any fault or negligence on the part of
the plaintiff, or his parents or guardians, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant having answered the complaint, and the action
having been called for trial, the defendant moved for judgment on
the pleadings. The motion was granted by Hall, J., and judgment
entered accordingly, from which plaintiff appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Bigelow, Flandrau &amp; Clark</em>, for respondent, relied on the opinion of
Hall, J., and the cases therein cited.<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c015'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Young, J.</span> In the elaborate opinion of the Court below, which
formed the basis of the argument for the defendant in this Court, the
case is treated as if the plaintiff was a mere trespasser, whose tender
years and childish instincts were no excuse for the commission of the
trespass, and who had no more right than any other trespasser to require
the defendant to exercise care to protect him from receiving injury
while upon its turn-table. But we are of opinion that, upon the
facts stated in the complaint, the plaintiff occupied a very different
position from that of a mere voluntary trespasser upon the defendant’s
property, and it is therefore unnecessary to consider whether the
proposition advanced by the defendant’s counsel, viz., that a landowner
owes no duty of care to trespassers, is not too broad a statement
of a rule which is true in many instances.</p>

<p class='c007'>To treat the plaintiff as a voluntary trespasser is to ignore the averments
of the complaint, that the turn-table, which was situate in a
public (by which we understand an open, frequented) place, was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>when left unfastened, very attractive, and, when put in motion by
them, was dangerous to young children, by whom it could be easily
put in motion, and many of whom were in the habit of going upon it
to play. The turn-table, being thus attractive, presented to the natural
instincts of young children a strong temptation; and such children,
following, as they must be expected to follow, those natural
instincts, were thus allured into a danger whose nature and extent
they, being without judgment or discretion, could neither apprehend
nor appreciate, and against which they could not protect themselves.
The difference between the plaintiff’s position and that of a voluntary
trespasser, capable of using care, consists in this, that the plaintiff was
induced to come upon the defendant’s turn-table by the defendant’s
own conduct, and that, as to him, the turn-table was a hidden danger,—a
trap.</p>

<p class='c007'>While it is held that a mere licensee “must take the permission with
its concomitant conditions,—it may be perils,” Hounsell <em>v.</em> Smyth,
7 C. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 731; Bolch <em>v.</em> Smith, 7 H. &amp; N. 836, yet even such
licensee has a right to require that the owner of the land shall not
knowingly and carelessly put concealed dangers in his way. Bolch <em>v.</em>
Smith, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per</span></i> Channell and Wilde, BB.; Corby <em>v.</em> Hill, 4 C. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>)
556, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per</span></i> Willes, J.</p>

<p class='c007'>And where one goes upon the land of another, not by mere license,
but by invitation from the owner, the latter owes him a larger duty.
“The general rule or principle applicable to this class of cases is that
an owner or occupant is bound to keep his premises in a safe and suitable
condition for those who come upon and pass over them, using due
care, if he has held out any inducement, invitation, or allurement,
either express or implied, by which they have been led to enter
thereon.” <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per</span></i> Bigelow, C. J., in Sweeny <em>v.</em> Old Colony &amp; Newport
R. Co., 10 Allen, 368, reviewing many cases. And see Indermaur <em>v.</em>
Dames, L. R. 1 C. P. 274; L. R. 2 C. P. 311.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, what an express invitation would be to an adult, the temptation
of an attractive plaything is to a child of tender years. If the
defendant had left this turn-table unfastened for the purpose of attracting
young children to play upon it, knowing the danger into
which it was thus alluring them, it certainly would be no defence to
an action by the plaintiff, who had been attracted upon the turn-table
and injured, to say that the plaintiff was a trespasser, and that his
childish instincts were no excuse for his trespass. In Townsend <em>v.</em>
Wathen, 9 East, 277, it was held to be unlawful for a man to tempt
even his neighbor’s dogs into danger, by setting traps on his own
land, baited with strong-scented meat, by which the dogs were allured
to come upon his land and into his traps. In that case, Lord Ellenborough
asks, “What is the difference between drawing the animal
into the trap by his natural instinct, which he cannot resist, and
putting him there by manual force?” And Grose, J. says “A man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>must not set traps of this dangerous description in a situation to invite
his neighbor’s dogs, and, as it were, to compel them by their
instinct to come into the traps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that the defendant did not leave the turn-table unfastened
for the purpose of injuring young children; and if the defendant had
no reason to believe that the unfastened turn-table was likely to attract
and to injure young children, then the defendant would not be
bound to use care to protect from injury the children that it had no
good reason to suppose were in any danger. But the complaint states
that the defendant knew that the turn-table, when left unfastened,
was easily revolved; that, when left unfastened, it was very attractive,
and when put in motion by them, dangerous, to young children;
and knew also that many children were in the habit of going upon it to
play. The defendant therefore knew that by leaving this turn-table
unfastened and unguarded, it was not merely inviting young children
to come upon the turn-table, but was holding out an allurement,
which, acting upon the natural instincts by which such children are
controlled, drew them by those instincts into a hidden danger; and
having thus knowingly allured them into a place of danger, without
their fault (for it cannot blame them for not resisting the temptation
it has set before them), it was bound to use care to protect them from
the danger into which they were thus led, and from which they could
not be expected to protect themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>We agree with the defendant’s counsel that a railroad company is
not required to make its land a safe playground for children. It has
the same right to maintain and use its turn-table that any landowner
has to use his property. It is not an insurer of the lives or limbs of
young children who play upon its premises. We merely decide that
when it sets before young children a temptation which it has reason to
believe will lead them into danger, it must use ordinary care to protect
them from harm. What would be proper care in any case must, in
general, be a question for the jury, upon all the circumstances of the
case.</p>

<p class='c007'>The position we have taken is fully sustained by the following cases,
some of which go much farther in imposing upon the owner of dangerous
articles the duty of using care to protect from injury children
who may be tempted to play near or meddle with them, than it is
necessary to go in this case. Lynch <em>v.</em> Nurdin, 1 Q. B. 29; Birge <em>v.</em>
Gardiner, 19 Conn. 507; Whirley <em>v.</em> Whiteman, 1 Head, 610.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that, in the cases cited, the principal question discussed
is not whether the defendant owed the plaintiff the duty of care, but
whether the defendant was absolved from liability for breach of duty
by reason of the fact that the plaintiff was a trespasser, who, by his
own act, contributed to the injury; and the distinction is not sharply
drawn between the effect of the plaintiff’s trespass, as a bar to his
right to require care, and the plaintiff’s contributory negligence, as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>bar to his right to recover for the defendant’s failure to exercise such
care as it was his duty to use. But as a young child, whom the defendant
knowingly tempts to come upon his land, if anything more than
a technical trespasser, is led into the commission of the trespass by the
defendant himself, and thus occupies a position widely different from
that of an ordinary trespasser, the fact that the Courts, in the cases referred
to, assumed, instead of proving, that the defendant owed to a
young child, under such circumstances, a duty he would not owe to an
ordinary trespasser, for whose trespass he was not in any way responsible,
does not weaken the authority of those cases. And in Railroad
Co. <em>v.</em> Stout, 17 Wall. 657 (a case in all respects similar to the present),
the distinction insisted on by counsel is taken by Mr. Justice
Hunt, and the circumstance that the plaintiff was in some sense a
trespasser is held not to exempt the defendant from the duty of care.
In the charge of the learned circuit judge at the trial of the last named
case (reported under the title of Stout <em>v.</em> Sioux City &amp; Pacific R. Co.,
2 Dillon, 294), the elements which must concur to render the defendant
liable, in a case like the present, are clearly stated.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Hughes <em>v.</em> Macfie, 2 Hurlst. &amp; Coltm. 744, and Mangan <em>v.</em> Atterton,
L. R. 1 Exch. 239, cited by defendant’s counsel, there was nothing
to show that the defendants knew or had reason to apprehend that the
cellar lid in the one case, or the crushing machine in the other, would
be likely to attract young children into danger. It must be conceded
that Hughes <em>v.</em> Macfie is not easily to be reconciled with Birge <em>v.</em> Gardiner,
and that Mangan <em>v.</em> Atterton seems to conflict with Lynch <em>v.</em>
Nurdin; but whether correctly decided or otherwise, they do not
necessarily conflict with our decision in this case.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much reliance is placed by defendant on Phila. &amp; Reading R. Co.
<em>v.</em> Hummell, 44 Penn. St. 375 and Gillis <em>v.</em> Penn. R. Co., 59 Penn.
St. 129. In the first of these cases, the plaintiff, a young child, was
injured by coming upon the track while the cars were in motion. The
only negligence charged upon the defendant was the omission to give
any signal at or after the starting of the train. If the plaintiff had
been crossing the track, through one of the openings which the company
had suffered the people in the neighborhood to make in the train
while standing on the track, and the cars had then been run together
upon him, without any warning, the case would more nearly resemble
the present; but the facts, as they appear, show that the company used
abundant care, and that it had no reason to suppose that the plaintiff
was exposed to danger; and the decision is put upon the latter ground,
although Strong, J., delivering the opinion of the Court, uses language
which lends some support to the defendant’s contention in this case.
Gillis <em>v.</em> Penn. R. Co. was properly decided, on the ground that the
company did nothing to invite the plaintiff upon the platform, by the
fall of which he was injured, and that the platform was strong enough
to bear the weight of any crowd of people which the company might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>reasonably expect would come upon it. Neither of these cases is an
authority against, while a later case in the same court, Kay <em>v.</em> Penn.
R. Co., 65 Penn. St. 269, tends strongly to support, the plaintiff’s
right of action in this case; and the recent case of Pittsburg, A. &amp; M.
Passenger R. Co. <em>v.</em> Caldwell, 74 Penn. St. 421, points in the same
direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not urged upon the argument that the plaintiff was guilty of
contributory negligence, and we have assumed that the plaintiff exercised,
as he was bound to do, such reasonable care as a child of his
age and understanding was capable of using, and that there was no
negligence on the part of his parents or guardians, contributing to his
injury.</p>

<p class='c014'>Case, for personal injuries from the alleged negligence of the defendants
in not properly guarding and securing a turn-table. The
plaintiff, who sues by his father and next friend, was seven years old
when the accident occurred, June 23, 1877, and the action was commenced
June 7, 1884. Plea, the general issue and statute of limitations.
A motion for a nonsuit was denied, and the defendants
excepted. Verdict for the plaintiff. The facts are sufficiently stated
in the opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Clark, J.</span> The action is not barred by the statute of limitations.
“Any infant, married woman, or insane person may bring any personal
actions within two years after such disability is removed.”
G. L., c. 221, s. 7.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a general rule, in cases where a disability exists when the right
of action accrues, the statute does not run during the continuance of
the disability, and it has not commenced to run against the plaintiff.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Pierce <em>v.</em> Dustin, 24 N. H. 417; Little <em>v.</em> Downing, 37 N. H. 356. It
is said that the plaintiff’s next friend was under no disability, that he
could have brought the action at any time within six years after the
right of action accrued, and therefore the statute should apply to this
case. It is an answer to this suggestion that it is the infant’s action,
and the failure of the next friend to bring suit within six years is no
bar to the plaintiff’s right of action. Wood Lim. of Act. 476.</p>

<p class='c007'>The motion for a nonsuit raises the question whether there was evidence
upon which the jury could properly find a verdict for the plaintiff.
Paine <em>v.</em> Railway, 58 N. H. 611. The ground of the action is,
that the defendants were guilty of negligence in maintaining a turn-table
insecurely guarded, which, being wrongfully set in motion by
older boys, caused an injury to the plaintiff, who was at that time
seven years old, and was attracted to the turn-table by the noise of
the older and larger boys turning and playing upon it. The turn-table
was situated on the defendants’ land, about sixty feet from the public
street, in a cut with high, steep embankments on each side; and the
land on each side was private property and fenced. It was fastened
by a toggle, which prevented its being set in motion unless the toggle
was drawn by a lever, to which was attached a switch padlock, which
being locked prevented the lever from being used unless the staple was
drawn. At the time of the accident the turn-table was fastened by
the toggle, but it was a controverted point whether the padlock was
then locked. When secured by the toggle and not locked with the
padlock, the turn-table could not be set in motion by boys of the age
and strength of the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon these facts we think the action cannot be maintained. The
alleged negligence complained of relates to the construction and condition
of the turn-table, and it is not claimed that the defendants were
guilty of any active misconduct towards the plaintiff. The right of a
landowner in the use of his own land is not limited or qualified like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>the enjoyment of a right or privilege in which others have an interest,
as the use of a street for highway purposes under the general law, or
for other purposes under special license (Moynihan <em>v.</em> Whidden, 143
Mass. 287), where care must be taken not to infringe upon the lawful
rights of others. At the time of his injury the plaintiff was using the
defendants’ premises as a playground without right. The turn-table
was required in operating the defendants’ railroad. It was located on
its own land so far removed from the highway as not to interfere with
the convenience and safety of the public travel, and it was not a trap
set for the purpose of injuring trespassers. Aldrich <em>v.</em> Wright, 53
N. H. 404. Under these circumstances, the defendants owed no duty
to the plaintiff; and there can be no negligence or breach of duty
where there is no act or service which the party is bound to perform
or fulfil. A landowner is not required to take active measures to insure
the safety of intruders, nor is he liable for an injury resulting
from the lawful use of his premises to one entering upon them without
right. A trespasser ordinarily assumes all risk of danger from the
condition of the premises; and to recover for an injury happening to
him he must show that it was wantonly inflicted, or that the owner
or occupant, being present and acting, might have prevented the injury
by the exercise of reasonable care after discovering the danger.

Co., 95 Pa. St. 398; Gillespie <em>v.</em> McGowan, 100 Pa. St. 144; Mangan
<em>v.</em> Atterton, L. R. 1 Ex. 239. The maxim that a man must use
his property so as not to incommode his neighbor, only applies to
neighbors who do not interfere with it or enter upon it. Knight <em>v.</em>
Abert, 6 Pa. St. 472. To hold the owner liable for consequential
damages happening to trespassers from the lawful and beneficial use
of his own land would be an unreasonable restriction of his enjoyment
of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are not prepared to adopt the doctrine of Railroad Co. <em>v.</em> Stout,
17 Wall. 657, and cases following it, that the owner of machinery or
other property attractive to children is liable for injuries happening to
children wrongfully interfering with it on his own premises. The
owner is not an insurer of the safety of infant trespassers. One having
in his possession agricultural or mechanical tools is not responsible
for injuries caused to trespassers by careless handling, nor is the
owner of a fruit-tree bound to cut it down or enclose it, or to exercise
care in securing the staple and lock with which his ladder is fastened,
for the protection of trespassing boys who may be attracted by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>fruit. Neither is the owner or occupant of premises upon which there
is a natural or artificial pond, or a blueberry pasture, legally required
to exercise care in securing his gates and bars to guard against accidents
to straying and trespassing children. The owner is under no
duty to a mere trespasser to keep his premises safe; and the fact that
the trespasser is an infant cannot have the effect to raise a duty where
none otherwise exists. “The supposed duty has regard to the public
at large, and cannot well exist as to one portion of the public and not
to another, under the same circumstances. In this respect children,
women, and men are upon the same footing. In cases where certain
duties exist, infants may require greater care than adults, or a different
kind of care; but precautionary measures having for their object
the protection of the public must as a rule have reference to all classes
alike.” Nolan <em>v.</em> N. Y. N. H. &amp; H. Railroad Co., 53 Conn. 461.</p>

<p class='c007'>There being no evidence to charge the defendants with negligence,
the motion for a nonsuit should have been granted.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>COOKE <em>v.</em> MIDLAND GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY OF IRELAND<br /> <span class='sc'>In the House of Lords, March 1, 1909.</span><br /> <em>Reported in [1909] Appeal Cases, 229.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>The appellant by his father brought an action against the respondents
for an injury sustained on the company’s land in Meath under
the circumstances stated in the head-note, the details of which are
fully discussed in the judgments in this House. At the trial before
Lord O’Brien, C. J., the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for £550,
and judgment was entered accordingly. The jury found that the
fence was in a defective condition through the negligence of the defendants;
that the plaintiff was allured through the hedge and up to
the turn-table by the negligence of the defendants; and that it was
by reason of the defendants’ negligence and as the effective cause of
it that the misfortune occurred. That judgment was affirmed by the
King’s Bench Division in Ireland (Palles, C. B., and Johnson, J.,
Kenny, J., dissenting) and was afterwards set aside by the Court of
Appeal in Ireland (Sir S. Walker, L. C., FitzGibbon and Holmes,
L.JJ.). Hence this appeal by the plaintiff.<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c015'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span><span class='sc'>Lord Macnaghten.</span> My Lords, the only question before your
Lordships is this: Was there evidence of negligence on the part of the
company fit to be submitted to the jury? If there was, the verdict
must stand, although your Lordships might have come to a different
conclusion on the same materials.</p>

<p class='c007'>I cannot help thinking that the issue has been somewhat obscured
by the extravagant importance attached to the gap in the hedge, both
in the arguments of counsel and in the judgments of some of the
learned judges who have had the case under consideration. That
there was a gap there, that it was a good broad gap some three feet
wide, is, I think, proved beyond question. But of all the circumstances
attending the case it seems to me that this gap taken by itself
is the least important. I have some difficulty in believing that a
gap in a roadside fence is a strange and unusual spectacle in any part
of Ireland. But however that may be, I quite agree that the insufficiency
of the fence, though the company were bound by Act of
Parliament to maintain it, cannot be regarded as the effective cause
of the accident.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question for the consideration of the jury may, I think, be
stated thus: Would not a private individual of common sense and
ordinary intelligence, placed in the position in which the company
were placed, and possessing the knowledge which must be attributed
to them, have seen that there was a likelihood of some injury happening
to children resorting to the place and playing with the turn-table,
and would he not have thought it his plain duty either to put a stop
to the practice altogether, or at least to take ordinary precautions to
prevent such an accident as that which occurred?</p>

<p class='c007'>This, I think, was substantially the question which the Lord Chief
Justice presented to the jury. It seems to me to be in accordance
with the view of the Court of Queen’s Bench in Lynch <em>v.</em> Nurdin,
1 Q. B. 29, and the opinion expressed by Romer and Stirling, L.JJ.,
in McDowall <em>v.</em> Great Western Ry. Co., [1903] 2 K. B. 331.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lord Chancellor of Ireland puts Lynch <em>v.</em> Nurdin, 1 Q. B. 29,
aside. He holds that it bears no analogy to the present case, because
the thing that did the mischief there was a “cart in the public street—a
nuisance.” But no question of nuisance was considered in
Lynch <em>v.</em> Nurdin. That point was not suggested. The ground of
the decision is a very simple proposition. “If,” says Lord Denman,
“I am guilty of negligence in leaving anything dangerous in a place
where I know it to be extremely probable that some other person will
unjustifiably set it in motion to the injury of a third, and if that
injury should be so brought about, I presume that the sufferer might
have redress by action against both or either of the two, but unquestionably
against the first.” If that proposition be sound, surely the
character of the place, though, of course, an element proper to be
considered, is not a matter of vital importance. It cannot make very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>much difference whether the place is dedicated to the use of the public
or left open by a careless owner to the invasion of children who
make it their playground.</p>

<p class='c007'>I think the jury were entitled and bound to take into consideration
all the circumstances of the case—the mode in which the turn-table
was constructed; its close proximity to the wall by which the plaintiff’s
leg was crushed; the way in which it was left, unfenced, unlocked,
and unfastened; the history of this bit of ground and its
position, shut off as it was by an embankment from the view of the
company’s servants at the station, and lying half derelict. After the
construction of the embankment it served no purpose in connection
with the company’s undertaking, except that at one time a corner of it
was used as a receptacle for some timber belonging to the company,
and afterwards as a site for this turn-table. In other respects, and
apart from these uses, it seems to have been devoted or abandoned to
the sustenance of the railway inspector’s goat and the diversion of the
youth of Navan. It is proved that in spite of a notice board idly forbidding
trespass it was a place of habitual resort for children, and
that children were frequently playing with the timber, and afterwards
with the turn-table. At the date of the trial, twelve months
after the accident, a beaten path leading from the gap bore witness
both to the numbers that flocked to the spot and to the special attraction
that drew children to it. It is remarkable that not a single word
of cross-examination as to either of these points was addressed to the
principal witnesses for the plaintiff, Tully, the herd, and Gertrude
Cooke, the plaintiff’s sister; nor was any explanation or evidence
offered on the part of the company. Now the company knew, or
must be deemed to have known, all the circumstances of the case
and what was going on. Yet no precaution was taken to prevent an
accident of a sort that might well have been foreseen and very easily
prevented. They did not close up the gap until after the accident.
Then it was the first thing thought of. But it was too late. They
did not summon any of the children who played there, or bring them
before the magistrates, as a warning to trespassers and a proof that
they were really in earnest in desiring to stop an objectionable practice
which had gone on so long and so openly. They did not have
their turn-table locked automatically in the way in which Mr. Barnes,
C. E., whose evidence is uncontradicted, says it is usual to lock such
machines. The table, it seems, was not even fastened. There was a
bolt; but if Cooke, the father of the plaintiff, is to be believed, the
bolt was rusty and unworkable. The jury were not bound to believe
Fowler, a ganger in the service of the company, in preference to
Cooke. Fowler, after some incautious admissions which the jury
probably accepted as true, turned round and showed himself, as the
Chief Justice says, to be hostile to the plaintiff. He prevaricated to
such an extent that the jury were justified in disregarding everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>said by him with the view of shielding his employers or saving
himself from blame, whether it came out of his own head, as the
nonsense he talked about rat-holes, or was suggested by counsel, as
the expression of “hunting” children off the ground.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>It seems to me that the Chief Justice would have been wrong if he
had withdrawn the case from the jury. I think the jury were entitled,
in view of all the circumstances, on the evidence before them,
uncontradicted as it was, to find that the company were guilty of
negligence. I am therefore of opinion that the finding of the jury
should be upheld and the judgment under appeal reversed, with
pauper costs here and costs below; and I move your Lordships
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will only add that I do not think that this verdict will be followed
by the disastrous consequences to railway companies and landowners
which the Lord Chancellor of Ireland seems to apprehend. Persons
may not think it worth their while to take ordinary care of their own
property, and may not be compellable to do so; but it does not seem
unreasonable to hold that, if they allow their property to be open to
all comers, infants as well as children of maturer age, and place upon
it a machine attractive to children and dangerous as a plaything, they
may be responsible in damages to those who resort to it with their
tacit permission, and who are unable, in consequence of their tender
age, to take care of themselves.<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c015'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Action to recover for damage occurring as hereinafter stated.
Pleas: first, not guilty; second, various special pleas. Issues thereon.<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c015'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial, before <span class='sc'>Channell, B.</span>, at the last Hampshire Summer
Assizes, the following facts appeared: The plaintiff was a millwright
employed in the Government dock-yard at Portsmouth. The defendant
was a contractor, and had been engaged for some time in enlarging
one of the docks. The men employed in the dock-yard were not allowed
to leave it during the day, and water-closets had been built for
their use. For the purpose of going to these water-closets, they had
permission to use certain paths which crossed the dock-yard. The defendant
had been permitted to erect a mortar-mill for the purpose of
his work, and he built an engine-house on one side of one of these
paths and the mortar-mill on the other side of the path. A revolving
shaft which connected the engine with the mill was placed across the
path about six inches above the level of the ground. This shaft was
partly covered with a few planks not joined together, and forming
an incline upwards from the ground, so that a barrow could be wheeled
over it. The shaft had been on that spot covered or uncovered for
five years. The plaintiff had gone along this path to one of the water-closets,
and whilst returning he accidentally stumbled when near the
shaft, which was in rapid motion, and on reaching out his hand to
save himself his left arm was caught by the shaft, and so much lacerated
that it was necessary to amputate it. There were two other paths
by which the plaintiff might have reached the water-closet; but the
one he used was the shortest and most convenient.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of the defendant’s case it appeared that the shaft had
been fenced to some extent but not sufficiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the close of the defendant’s case, the learned judge proposed to
leave it to the jury to assess the damages, supposing the plaintiff had
a right of action, and then to nonsuit the plaintiff, reserving leave for
him to move to set aside the nonsuit, and enter the verdict for the
amount assessed by the jury. The plaintiff’s counsel declined to accede
to this course; whereupon the learned judge left it to the jury to
say: first, whether the plaintiff was lawfully using the way in question
on the day of the accident; secondly, whether the defendant was
guilty of negligence in leaving the shaft in the state it was on that
day. The jury answered both questions in the affirmative, and they
added that they found “that the shaft was not sufficiently fenced;”
and they assessed the damages at 230<em>l.</em> A verdict having been entered
for the plaintiff for that amount.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span><em>Coleridge</em>, in last Michaelmas Term, obtained a rule nisi for a new
trial, on the ground that the learned judge misdirected the jury in
not telling them that there was no obligation on the part of the defendant
to fence the shaft; and also that the verdict was against the
evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Channell, B.</span> I am of opinion that the rule must be absolute for
a new trial. [Remainder of opinion omitted.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Martin, B.</span> I am of the same opinion. The real objection to this
action is that the plaintiff has failed to establish that there was any
obligation or duty on the part of the defendant to have this path in
any other condition than it was at the time of the accident. That
should have been established in some way. If the plaintiff could have
shown any such obligation on the part of the defendant he would have
made out a case, but that was a condition precedent, and the plaintiff
has wholly failed to do so. The defendant had a right to erect the
machinery, to erect it in the place he did, and to work it in the manner
he was doing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then what is the true condition of the plaintiff? It is said that he
had a right to go along the path across which the machinery was
erected, for he was a workman employed in the dock-yard, and had
liberty to use the water-closet. But that is a fallacious argument. It
is true the plaintiff had permission to use the path. Permission involves
leave and license, but it gives no <em>right</em>. If I avail myself of
permission to cross a man’s land, I do so by virtue of a license, not of
a right. It is an abuse of language to call it a right: it is an excuse
or license, so that the party cannot be treated as a trespasser. Inasmuch
as there was another way by which the plaintiff might have
gone, but voluntarily chose the one which was out of order, I think
he has no right of action against the defendant, and that he ought to
have been nonsuited at the trial.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Wilde, B.</span> I am of the same opinion. It is of importance in all
these cases that the facts upon which the decisions are based should
be made plain. The plaintiff was one of a number of persons who obtained
leave and license from the dock-yard authorities to cross the
yard from one place to another. The defendant had permission from
the same authorities to put up certain machinery in the yard. The
plaintiff while walking along the usual track fell down, not by reason
of any obstruction, but in consequence of stumbling, and in trying to
save himself, his arm came in contact with a revolving shaft and was
lacerated.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will decide the case as if it were a question between the plaintiff
and the owners of the yard, because if they are not responsible for
putting up the shaft, a fortiori the defendant is not. Then, was there
any obligation on the owners of the yard not to put up machinery that
might be dangerous to persons crossing it? None of the facts tend to
show that any such obligation existed. If what was put up was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>obstruction to any person who used that way, the only consequence
would be that he would have to go another way. That being so, it
appears to me that this action cannot lie, because I agree that it is
founded upon a duty, and none exists.</p>

<p class='c007'>That disposes of the case; but I will add that I do not mean to say
that if the defendant had made a hole in the yard, and had covered it
in a way that was insufficient, but which appeared to be sufficient, he
would not have been liable. But here there was nothing of that character.
The danger was open and visible. There was nothing which
could be called a “trap.”</p>

<h5 class='c013'>GAUTRET <em>v.</em> EGERTON<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Common Pleas, February 11, 1867.</span><br /> <em>Reported in Law Reports, 2 Common Pleas, 371.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>The declaration in the first of these actions stated that the defendants
were possessed of a close of land, and of a certain canal and cuttings
intersecting the same, and of certain bridges across the said canal
and cuttings, communicating with and leading to certain docks of the
defendants, which said land and bridges had been and were from time
to time used with the consent and permission of the defendants by persons
proceeding towards and coming from the said docks; that the
defendants, well knowing the premises, wrongfully, negligently, and
improperly kept and maintained the said land, canal, cuttings, and
bridges, and suffered them to continue and be in so improper a state
and condition as to render them dangerous and unsafe for persons lawfully
passing along and over the said land and bridges towards the
said docks, and using the same as aforesaid; and that Leon Gautret,
whilst he was lawfully in and passing and walking along the said close
and over the said bridge, and using the same in the manner and for
the purpose aforesaid, by and through the said wrongful, negligent,
and improper conduct of the defendants as aforesaid, fell into one of
the said cuttings of the defendants, intersecting the said close as aforesaid,
and thereby lost his life within twelve calendar months next
before the suit: and the plaintiff, as administratrix, for the benefit
of herself, the widow of the said Leon Gautret, and A. Gautret, &amp;c.,
according to the statute in such case made and provided, claimed
2,500<em>l.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>The defendants demurred to the declaration, on the ground that “it
does not appear that there was any legal duty or obligation on the part
of the defendants to take means for preventing the said land, &amp;c.,
being dangerous and unsafe.” Joinder.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Crompton</em> (<em>Mellish, Q. C.</em>, with him), in support of the demurrer.—To
maintain this action, the declarations ought to show a <em>duty</em> in
the defendants to keep the canal, cuttings, and bridges in a safe condition,
and also that some invitation had been held out to the deceased
to come there, and that the thing complained of constituted a sort of
trap. Seymour <em>v.</em> Maddox, 16 Q. B. 326 (E. C. L. R. vol. 71), 19
L. J. Q. B. 525; Corby <em>v.</em> Hill, 4 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 556 (E. C. L. R. vol. 93),
27 L. J. C. P. 318. The declaration is entirely wanting in all these
particulars. It is not enough to show that the defendants were aware
that the place in question was in an unsafe condition, and that the
public were in the habit of passing along it. Hounsell <em>v.</em> Smyth,
7 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 731, 29 L. J. C. P. 203.</p>

<p class='c007'>[<span class='sc'>Willes, J.</span> The declaration does not even state that the deceased
persons were unacquainted with the state of the place.]</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Herschell</em>, for the plaintiff Gautret.—The question raised upon
this declaration is, whether there is any duty on the part of the defendants
toward persons using their land as the deceased here did. That
may be negligence in the case of a licensee, which would not be negligence
as against a mere trespasser: and, if there can be any case in
which the law would imply a duty, it is sufficiently alleged here.</p>

<p class='c007'>[<span class='sc'>Willes, J.</span> It may be the duty of the defendants to abstain from
doing any act which may be dangerous to persons coming upon the
land by their invitation or permission, as in Indermaur <em>v.</em> Dames,
Law Rep. 1 C. P. 274.<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c015'><sup>[143]</sup></a> So, if I employ one to carry an article which
is of a peculiarly dangerous nature, without cautioning him, I may be
responsible for any injury he sustains through the absence of such
caution. That was the case of Farrant <em>v.</em> Barnes, 11 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 553,
31 L. J. C. P. 137. But, what duty does the law impose upon these
defendants to keep their bridges in repair? If I dedicate a way to
the public which is full of ruts and holes, the public must take it as
it is. If I dig a pit in it, I may be liable for the consequences: but,
if I do nothing, I am not.]</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not necessary to specify the nature of the negligence which is
charged: it was enough to allege generally a duty and a breach of it.
Knowing the bridge to be unsafe, it was the duty of the defendants
not to permit the public to use it. In Bolch <em>v.</em> Smith, 7 H. &amp; N. 736,
31 L. J. Ex. 201, the defect in the fencing of the shaft was apparent:
but the judgments of Channell and Wilde, BB., seem to concede that,
if there had been a concealed defect, the action would have been maintainable.
That shows that there is some duty in such a case as this.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span><em>Potter</em>, for the plaintiff Jones, submitted that the implied request on
the part of the defendants to persons having occasion to go to the
docks to pass by the way in question, raised a duty in them to keep it
in a safe condition.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Willes, J.</span> I am of opinion that our judgment must be for the defendants
in each of these cases. The argument urged on behalf of the
plaintiffs, when analyzed, amounts to this, that we ought to construe
the general words of the declaration as describing whatever sort of
negligence the plaintiffs can prove at the trial. The authorities, however,
and reason and good sense, are the other way. The plaintiff
must, in his declaration, give the defendant notice of what his complaint
is. He must recover <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundum allegata et probata</span></i>. What is it
that a declaration of this sort should state in order to fulfil those conditions?
It ought to state the facts upon which the supposed duty is
founded, and the duty to the plaintiff with the breach of which the
defendant is charged. It is not enough to show that the defendant
has been guilty of negligence, without showing in what respect he was
negligent, and how he became bound to use care to prevent injury to
others. All that these declarations allege is, that the defendants were
possessed of land, and of a canal and cuttings intersecting the same,
and of certain bridges across the canal and cuttings communicating
with and leading to certain docks of theirs; that they allowed persons
going to and from the docks, whether upon the business or for the
profit of the defendants or not, to pass over the land; and that the
deceased persons, in pursuance of and using that permission, fell into
one of the cuttings, and so met their deaths. The consequences of
these accidents are sought to be visited upon these defendants, because
they have allowed persons to go over their land, not alleging it to
have been upon the business or for the benefit of the defendants, or
as the servants or agents of the defendants; nor alleging that the
defendants have been guilty of any wrongful act, such as digging a
trench on the land, or misrepresenting its condition, or anything
equivalent to laying a trap for the unwary passengers; but simply
because they permitted these persons to use a way with the condition
of which, for anything that appears, those who suffered the injury
were perfectly well acquainted. That is the whole sum and
substance of these declarations. If the docks to which the way in
question led were public docks, the way would be a public way, and
the township or parish would be bound to repair it, and no such liability
as this could be cast upon the defendants merely by reason of
the soil of the way being theirs. That is so not only in reason but
also upon authority. It was so held in Robbins <em>v.</em> Jones, 15 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span>
221, 33 L. J. C. P. 1, where a way having been for a number of years
dedicated to the public, we held that the owner of the adjoining house
was not responsible for death resulting to a person from the giving
way of the pavement, partly in consequence of its being over-weighted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>by a number of persons crowding upon it, and partly from its having
been weakened by user. Assuming that these were private docks, the
private property of the defendants, and that they permitted persons
going to or coming from the docks, whether for their own benefit or
that of the defendants, to use the way, the dedication of a permission
to use the way must be taken to be in the character of a gift. The
principle of law as to gifts is, that the giver is not responsible for damage
resulting from the insecurity of the thing, unless he knew its evil
character at the time, and omitted to caution the donee. There must
be something like fraud on the part of the giver before he can be made
answerable. It is quite consistent with the declarations in these cases
that this land was in the same state at the time of the accident that it
was in at the time the permission to use it was originally given. To
create a cause of action, something like fraud must be shown. No
action will lie against a spiteful man who, seeing another running into
a position of danger, merely omits to warn him. To bring the case
within the category of actionable negligence, some wrongful act must
be shown, or a breach of some positive duty: otherwise, a man who
allows strangers to roam over his property would be held to be answerable
for not protecting them against any danger which they
might encounter whilst using the license. Every man is bound not
wilfully to deceive others, or do any act which may place them in
danger. It may be, as in Corby <em>v.</em> Hill, 4 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 556, 27 L. J. C. P.
318, that he is responsible if he puts an obstruction on the way which
is likely to cause injury to those who by his permission use the way;
but I cannot conceive that he could incur any responsibility merely by
reason of his allowing the way to be out of repair. For these reasons,
I think these declarations disclose no cause of action against the
defendants, and that the latter are therefore entitled to judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Keating, J.</span> I am of the same opinion. It is not denied that a declaration
of this sort must show a duty and a breach of that duty. But
it is said that these declarations are so framed that it would be necessary
for the plaintiffs at the trial to prove a duty. I am, however,
utterly unable to discover any duty which the defendants have contracted
towards the persons whom the plaintiffs represent, or what
particular breach of duty is charged. It is said that the condition of
the land and bridges was such as to constitute them a kind of trap. I
cannot accede to that. The persons who used the way took it with all
its imperfections.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Civil action tried at Fall Term, 1882, of Beaufort Superior Court,
before Gilliam, J.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Smith, C. J.</span> The defendant owns and operates a mill, that has
been built and used for one hundred years, at the head of Pungo creek.
A few yards below its site the creek divides, and its waters flow in two
separate streams. Along its course on either side run parallel public
roads each two miles distant, and from them have been constructed
private ways leading up to and meeting at the mill, and affording convenient
access from the roads to it. One of these ways was opened by
former proprietors, and the other in the year 1867, by the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1875 or 1876, the defendant, with other owners of the intervening
land, united in opening a connecting way, between those leading
from the public roads, from near points in each, so as to form a direct
passway across the two divergent streams from one road to the other,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>without going up to the mill. Over these waters they also constructed
bridges. While this direct route was opened mainly for the convenience
of the defendant and his associates, whose lands were traversed,
it was also used as well by the public with full knowledge of the defendant,
and without objection from any one in passing between the
roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>In February, 1882, the plaintiff, with his horse, while in the use of
this connecting way and passing one of the bridges, broke through,
and both were precipitated into the creek, and the damage sustained
for the redress of which the suit is brought.</p>

<p class='c007'>The flooring of the bridge was sound, and there was no visible indication
of weakness or decay to put a person passing over it on his
guard. But the timbers underneath, and hidden by the floor, were in
a rotten and unsound condition, and of this the defendant had full
knowledge before the disaster.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was at his mill and saw what occurred, and going up to the place
remarked to the plaintiff that when he saw him about to enter the
bridge he thought of calling him to stop, but did not do so; that the
bridge was unsafe, and he regretted he did not stop the plaintiff from
crossing.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are the material facts found by the judge, under the consent
of parties that he should pass upon the evidence and ascertain the
facts of the case, and our only inquiry is upon the correctness of his
ruling that the defendant is liable in damages to the plaintiff, and
from which the defendant appeals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only case in our reports bearing upon the point is that of Mulholland
<em>v.</em> Brownrigg, 2 Hawks, 349. There, the defendant’s millpond
overflowed parts of the public road, and hollow bridges had been
erected, but by whom, did not appear; nor was it shown that they
were built at the expense of the public. This condition of things had
existed for twenty years, and the mill had been owned and operated
by the defendant for the space of five years. The successive mill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>proprietors had kept the overflowed bed of the road and the bridges
in repair. The plaintiff’s wagon, loaded with goods, passing a bridge,
broke through, in consequence of its decayed state, and the goods were
injured by the water. The action was for this injury. It was declared
by the Court that as a nuisance was created by the flooding of the
road, and the defendant had undertaken to remedy it in constructing
the bridges, it was his duty, as that of preceding proprietors of the
mill, to maintain them in a proper condition of repair, and ensure the
safety of those persons who in using the road had to pass over them,
and that the damage having resulted from his negligence he was liable
to the plaintiff. The proposition is asserted, that inasmuch as the
defendant has undertaken to remedy a nuisance of his own creating,
by constructing the bridge, he undertakes also and is bound to keep
it in sufficient repair, and is answerable for the consequences of his
neglect to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principle of law, in more general terms and with a wider scope,
is thus expressed by Hoar, J., in Combs <em>v.</em> New Bed. Con. Co., 102
Mass. 584. “There is another class of cases in which it has been held
that, if a person allows a dangerous place to exist in premises occupied
by him, he will be responsible for injury caused thereby, to any other
person entering upon the premises by his invitation and procurement,
express or implied, and not notified of the danger, if the person
injured is in the use of due care.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The principle is well settled,” remarks Appleton, C. J., “that a
person injured, without neglect on his part, by a defect or obstruction
in a way or passage over which he has been induced to pass for a lawful
purpose, by an invitation express or implied, can recover damages
for the injury sustained, against the individual so inviting, and
being in default for the neglect.” Tobin <em>v.</em> P. S. &amp; P. R. R., 59
Maine, 188.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several illustrations of the principle in its different applications
will be found in Wharton on Negligence, § 826, and following.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts of the present case bring it within the rule thus enunciated.
The way was opened by the defendant and his associates;
primarily, though it was for his and their accommodation, yet, permissively,
to the general travelling public. It has, in fact, been thus
used, and known to the defendant to be thus used, with the acquiescence
of himself and the others; and under these circumstances it
may fairly be assumed to be an invitation to all who have occasion
thus to use it; and hence a voluntary obligation is incurred to keep
the bridges in a safe condition, so that no detriment may come to
travellers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reparation is an inseparable incident of its construction, and, as the
obligation to repair rests on no other, the liability for neglect must
rest on those who put the bridges there and invited the public to use
them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>It is true the way might have been closed, or the public prohibited
by proper notices from passing over it, and no one could complain of
the exercise of the right to do so; but as long as the way is left open
and the bridges remain for the public to use, it is incumbent on those
who constructed and maintain them to see that they are safe for all.</p>

<p class='c007'>The law does not tolerate the presence over and along a way in
common use, of structures apparently sound, but in fact ruinous, like
man-traps, inviting travellers to needless disaster and injury. The
duty of reparation should rest on some one, and it can rest on none
others but those who built and used the bridges, and impliedly at least
invite the public to use them also. For neglect of this duty they must
abide the consequences.</p>

<p class='c007'>We hold, therefore, that there is no error, and the judgment must be
affirmed.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>No error.</em></p>

<p class='c014'>Declaration. That the defendant was possessed of a crane fixed
upon the New Hibernia Wharf, in a certain passage called Montague
Close, Southwark, along which passage the plaintiff and others were
permitted to pass, repass, and use the same as a way to certain
wharves; that the crane was used by the defendant and his servants
to raise and lower goods over the passage; that the plaintiff was,
with the permission of the proprietors of the passage, lawfully passing
along the said passage to the said wharves; yet the defendant, by
himself and his servants, so negligently, &amp;c. managed, directed, and
conducted themselves that by and through such neglect, &amp;c., a part
of said crane broke, whilst the defendant, by his servants, was using
the same, and certain goods fell upon the plaintiff whilst he was
passing along, &amp;c. and broke both his legs, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pleas: 1. Not guilty. 2. That the plaintiff and others were not permitted
by the proprietors of the said passage to pass, repass, and use
the said passage as a way from a highway to certain wharves, as in the
declaration charged. 3. That the plaintiff was not, with the permission
of the proprietors of the said passage, lawfully passing along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>said passage from the said highway to the said wharves, as in the
declaration alleged.</p>

<p class='c007'>Issue on the said pleas.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial before Blackburn, J., at the Croydon Summer Assizes,
1861, it was proved that the plaintiff, the son of a laborer employed in
the erection of West Kent Wharf, under a contractor for the defendant’s
father, had, on the day when the accident happened, taken his
father’s dinner, according to his usual custom, to West Kent Wharf,
and on his return was obliged to pass under a crane erected on the
defendant’s (Hibernia) wharf, and there employed in lowering barrels
of sugar. As he was passing the chain broke, and 12 cwt. of sugar
fell upon him, inflicting the injuries complained of. The breakage of
the chain was caused by negligence in the mode of applying the breaks,
for, after the sugar had been attached the chain of the crane was allowed
to run, and then the man suddenly put on the break and the
jerk caused the weight to rise and fall and the chain to break. Montague
Close is approached by steps from London Bridge, the gate to
which was usually opened very early in the morning, and numbers of
persons, to the knowledge of the defendant, used to pass along the
passage, and no objection was made to persons using the way if on
legitimate business. The judge left the following questions to the
jury: 1st, Was the accident caused by the negligence of the defendant,
or was it a pure accident over which no one could have any
control? 2d, Could the boy by reasonable care have avoided the
accident? 3d, Were the plaintiff and others permitted to go up
Montague Close by the owners? 4th, Did the defendant on the evidence
as disclosed tacitly give permission to the plaintiff to pass that
way? 5th, Was the boy going to the wharf for a legitimate purpose?
The jury having answered all the questions in favor of the plaintiff, a
verdict was entered for him, with leave for the defendant to move to
set it aside and enter a verdict on the second and third issues. The
damages were assessed at £100.</p>

<p class='c007'>A rule <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi</span></i> having been obtained calling on the plaintiff to show
cause why the verdict should not be entered for the defendant on the
second and third issues,—</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Shee</em>, Serjt., (<em>Grady</em> with him,) showed cause. On the form of the
rule as obtained the plaintiff is clearly entitled to succeed, as there was
evidence that the defendant did by his acts tacitly give permission to
the boy to pass along the close for a lawful purpose, and the jury have
so found. But the plaintiff is also entitled to succeed on the broader
ground. In Corby <em>v.</em> Hill, 4 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 556, it was held that the defendant
was liable for the negligence of his servant in placing materials
in a dangerous position, and without notice, on a private road along
which persons were accustomed to pass by leave of the owners; and
in Southcote <em>v.</em> Stanley, 25 L. J. 339, Ex.,<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c015'><sup>[146]</sup></a> a visitor to a person’s house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>was held entitled to recover for injuries caused by opening a glass door
which was insecure, and which it was necessary for him to open. (He
was then stopped by the Court.)</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Petersdorff</em>, Serjt., (<em>Bridge</em> with him,) in support of the rule. Montague
Close was the defendant’s private property, and no one had any
right to be there without his express or implied permission. The
lowering heavy goods from the warehouses by cranes is a manifestly
dangerous business, and persons using the way took upon themselves
whatever risks might be incidental to that business. In Hounsell <em>v.</em>
Smyth, 7 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 743, where the defendant was held not to be liable
for leaving a quarry unfenced on waste land across which the public
were allowed to pass, Williams, J., said: “No right is averred, but
merely that the owners allowed persons, for diversion or business, to
go across the waste without complaint; that is, that they were not so
churlish as to interfere with any one who went across. But a person
so using the waste has no right to complain of any excavation he may
find there; he must accept the permission with its concomitant conditions,
and it may be its perils.” [<span class='sc'>Blackburn, J.</span> Have you any
authority that persons so using the way take upon themselves the negligence
of the servants about the place?] In Bolch <em>v.</em> Smith, 31 L. J.
201, Ex., where workmen employed in a dock-yard were permitted to
use a place as a way on which revolving machinery had been erected, it
was held that the right so to use the place was only the right not to be
treated as a trespasser, and that there was no obligation to fence the
machinery, and no liability for insufficiently fencing it. [<span class='sc'>Cockburn,
C. J.</span> There was the ordinary state of things in that case, and no
superadded negligence.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cockburn, C. J.</span> I doubt whether on the pleadings and this rule it
is competent to enter into the question of negligence, and whether the
whole matter does not turn upon the question whether permission was
or was not given to the plaintiff to pass along the way. But I should
be sorry to decide this case upon that narrow ground. I quite agree
that a person who merely gives permission to pass and repass along his
close is not bound to do more than allow the enjoyment of such permissive
right under the circumstances in which the way exists; that
he is not bound, for instance, if the way passes along the side of a
dangerous ditch or along the edge of a precipice, to fence off the ditch
or precipice. The grantee must use the permission as the thing exists.
It is a different question, however, where negligence on the part of the
person granting the permission is superadded. It cannot be that, having
granted permission to use a way subject to existing dangers, he is
to be allowed to do any further act to endanger the safety of the person
using the way. The plaintiff took the permission to use the way
subject to a certain amount of risk and danger, but the case assumes a
different aspect when the negligence of the defendant—for the negligence
of his servants is his—is added to that risk and danger. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>way in question was a private one leading to different wharves. On
part of the way a wharf was being constructed or repaired, and the
plaintiff’s father was employed upon that work. It was the father’s
habit not to go home to his meals, and the boy used to take them to
him at the wharf, and on this occasion was passing along carrying his
father’s dinner. The plaintiff was therefore passing along on a perfectly
legitimate purpose, and the evidence is that the defendant permitted
the way to be used by persons having legitimate business upon
the premises. That being so, the defendant places himself by such
permission under the obligation of not doing anything by himself or
his servants from which injury may arise, and if by any act of negligence
on the part of himself or his servants injury does arise, he is
liable to an action. That is the whole question. The plaintiff is
passing along the passage by permission of the defendant, and though
he could only enjoy that permission under certain contingencies, yet
when injury arises not from any of those contingencies, but from
the superadded negligence of the defendant, the defendant is liable
for that negligence as much as if it had been upon a public highway.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Wightman, J.</span> The rule in this case was obtained on a very narrow
ground. The declaration having alleged that the plaintiff and others
were permitted to pass, repass, and use the way in question, and that
the plaintiff was there with the permission of the proprietors of the
passage lawfully passing along the passage, the defendant took issue
on the fact whether such right to pass along the passage was permitted
by the defendant. I think that there was evidence to show that the
plaintiff had the permission of the defendant to use the way, and that
he was lawfully there at the time of the accident. I entirely agree with
my Lord Chief Justice that the plaintiff is also entitled to succeed on
the larger ground. It appears to me that such a permission as is here
alleged may be subject to the qualification that the person giving it
shall not be liable for injuries to persons using the way arising from
the ordinary state of things, or of the ordinary nature of the business
carried on; but that is distinguishable from the case of injuries wholly
arising from the negligence of that person’s servants.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Crompton, J.</span> I am of the same opinion. I think we should look
not only to the grounds upon which this rule was granted, but to the
real defence set up by my brother Petersdorff. That defence is, in
effect, that the plaintiff was using the way only under the qualified permission
that he should be subject to any negligence of the plaintiff or
his servants. If that defence be sustainable upon the general issue, or
otherwise, we should see whether it is made out, and I am of opinion
that it is not made out. I quite agree with what has fallen from my
Lord and my brother Wightman. There may be a public dedication of
a way, or a private permission to use it subject to a qualification; for
example, subject to the danger arising from a stone step or a projecting
house; and in such a case the public, or the persons using the way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>take the right to use it subject to such qualification; but they are not
thereby to be made subject to risks from what may be called active
negligence. Whenever a party has a right to pass over certain ground,
if injury occurs to him while so passing from negligence, he has a right
to compensation. The argument of my brother Petersdorff fails therefore
upon this ground. I think, too, that it is doubtful whether even
the fact that the injured person was present unlawfully would excuse
negligence, though it would be an element in determining what is negligence,
and what is not. In the present case, however, that question
does not arise, as there is no doubt the plaintiff was there upon a
legitimate errand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Blackburn, J.</span> I am of the same opinion. If the substantial defence
raised existed I am not sure but what it could be raised under
the present pleadings, and the leave reserved; but at any rate I think
we could amend the pleadings, if necessary, to raise it. But I do not
think that any such defence exists here. The plaintiff seeks to recover
for the negligence of the defendant. Now, the existence of negligence
depends upon the duty of the party charged with it. I concur with the
judgment of the Court of Exchequer in Bolch <em>v.</em> Smith that, when permission
is given to a person to pass through a yard where dangerous
machinery is at work, no duty is cast upon the person giving such permission
to fence the machinery against the person permitted so to pass.
That decision does not touch the present case, which falls rather
within the remark then made by my brother Wilde: “If persons in the
condition of the defendant had left anything like a trap in route used
on the premises, I am far from saying they would not be liable.” This
is more like the case of Corby <em>v.</em> Hill, where the matter placed upon
the road is called a trap set for persons using it; and it is clear that
when one gives another permission to pass over his land, it is his duty
not to set a trap for him. Here the boy was passing upon a legitimate
errand while the defendant’s servants were employed in lowering
weights. If he had sustained any injury by a weight descending, without
any negligence of the defendant’s servants, there is no doubt that
he could not recover, but he suffered through the negligence of the persons
lowering the bags, who were well aware that people were in the
habit of passing below, and that danger would arise if the chain broke.
I think, therefore, that it was the duty of the defendant and his servants
to use ordinary care that the chain should not break. The jury
have found that they neglected that duty, and I do not disagree with
their finding. Our decision does not conflict with the judgment of the
Court of Exchequer in Bolch v. Smith, or of the Common Pleas in
Hounsell <em>v.</em> Smyth.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Action for damage to plaintiff’s horse.<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c015'><sup>[148]</sup></a> Trial by the court. The
case made by plaintiff’s evidence was in substance as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant purchased a lot of land in October, 1890. Across this lot
ran a road leading from one street to another, having a well-defined
track made by wagons, horses, etc. The road was not a public highway,
but had been used by the travelling public generally for a period
of from five to fifteen years. Defendant’s lot was not fenced on the
front and rear, the direction in which the road ran, but was fenced on
the sides. After building a house on the lot, defendant “informed”
the people travelling over this roadway not to use it any longer for
such purpose; but no heed was paid to this. In the latter part of December,
1890, in order the more effectually to stop the travel over the
lot, the defendant stretched a strand of barbed wire across the rear
end of the lot, about three feet above the ground and at right angles,
or nearly so, with said road. The entire fence was upon the appellee’s
lot. No notice of any kind was given of this obstruction otherwise
than as it advertised itself. The wire could not be seen in the dark
of night and only a short distance—twenty to twenty-five feet—in
daylight. There were no posts that could be seen from the road in
the night when the accident hereinafter alluded to occurred. The appellant,
who lived in that community, had frequently travelled over
the road leading across this lot, and had no notice or knowledge of its
being closed up with the wire. The last time before the accident
when he passed over the lot was in September or October, 1890. At
about 6 o’clock on the evening of January 1, 1891, after it had become
too dark to see this wire, the appellant attempted to drive across this
lot, in the road, to perform some legitimate errand on the other side.
Not knowing of the presence of the wire, he drove his horse briskly
ahead of him until the animal came up suddenly against the barbs,
cutting a gash in its front leg four to five inches in length and two
inches deep, severing the frontal muscle, from which the horse was
injured, to the damage of the appellant.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>When the appellant had closed his evidence, the learned judge observed
that he had examined the law of the case, and saw no reason
why a man could not fence in his own land, on his own ground, and
that, [if] “a travelling man over such property taking the license into
his own hand, without invitation or inducement, because others do so,
suffers injury, he must put up with it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge ruled that plaintiff’s evidence did not make out a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima
facie</span></i> right to recover; and found for defendant; denying plaintiff’s
motion for a new trial. Plaintiff appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Reinhard, C. J.</span> [The learned judge said that a license may be
created either by parol or by acquiescence in the use of the property
for the purpose in question without objection. He <em>held</em> that plaintiff
was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> a licensee, and not a trespasser.]</p>

<p class='c007'>A mere license, however, to travel over the land of another may be
revoked at any time at the pleasure of the licensor. Parish <em>v.</em> Kaspar,
109 Ind. 586; Simpson <em>v.</em> Wright, 21 Ill. App. 67; 13 Am. &amp; Eng.
Encyc. of Law, 555.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the license is once proved, however, or a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> case
of such license has been made out, it then devolves upon the party
asserting a revocation to prove it. Blunt <em>v.</em> Barrett, 54 N. Y. Sup.
548.</p>

<p class='c007'>Consequently if the license in the present case was claimed to have
been discontinued or revoked, the burden was upon appellees to show
that fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>Was such revocation established, or was there any evidence from
which the court could infer the same?</p>

<p class='c007'>The transfer of the property, or the fencing of the same, may, under
ordinary circumstances, be sufficient to amount to a revocation. Ordinarily
a man has a right to use his own property as he pleases, but
at the same time this gives him no right to use it to the detriment or
injury of his neighbor. We think the erection of an ordinary fence
around the lot, one that was not calculated to inflict injury, was proper
and right, and it was the privilege of the appellees to thus close up
their premises without asking of any one the permission to do so. But
whenever they undertook to inclose their property under circumstances
that made it dangerous to those likely to pass over it, and
which the appellees must anticipate would incur injury by it, it became
their duty, if such dangerous means must be employed to accomplish
the purpose, to give some sort of warning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it was held in Houston, etc., R. W. Co. <em>v.</em> Boozer, 70 Tex. 530,
that if the owner of the land has been accustomed to permit others to
use his property to travel over to such an extent as to produce a confident
belief that the use will not be objected to, he must not mislead
them by failing to give a proper warning of his intention to recall the
permission. See, also, Cornish <em>v.</em> Stubbs, 5 L. R. C. P. 334; Mellor
<em>v.</em> Watkins, L. R. 9 Q. B. 400.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>While we grant the clear right of the appellees to revoke the license,
we assert as emphatically that they must do so in a manner not calculated
under ordinary circumstances to inflict injury unnecessarily.
Although a licensee acquires no interest, as the term is usually employed,
nor property right in the real estate over which he is allowed
to travel, he yet has the right not to be wilfully or even recklessly injured
by the acts of the owner. It cannot be said truthfully that the
owner does not owe <em>some</em> duty to a licensee.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time of the stretching of the wire the appellees must have
known that the public would continue to travel over this lot until in
some way prevented from doing so. They must have known further
that a single strand of wire, without posts at the roadside, or other
means calculated to attract the attention of passers-by, could not be
seen in the dark, and was a dangerous obstruction, liable to injure
those coming in contact with it. They must, therefore, have anticipated
just such results as the one that happened to the appellant. It
was their clear duty, consequently, in case they desired to make use
of the dangerous wire, to shut out the public from going over their lot,
to give some warning by which the presence of the wire might be
detected. Had they used an ordinary fence, one constructed out
of material not necessarily dangerous to life and limb even if encountered
in the dark, the case might be otherwise, and notice might
not have been necessary. But the stretching of the barbed wire, without
notice, under the circumstances was, we think, a plain violation
of duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case made by the evidence is one of more than mere passive negligence.
In that class of cases it is well enough settled that there is no
liability to a mere licensee. Thus where the owner of premises inadvertently
leaves unguarded a pit, hatchway, trap-door, cistern, or
other dangerous opening, and one who is present merely by permission
and not by invitation, express or implied, falls into the opening
and is injured, he cannot recover, as, in such case, he enjoys the license
subject to the risks. Thiele <em>v.</em> McManus, 3 Ind. App. 132. But while
an owner may not be liable to one who is thus injured by mere inattention
and neglect of the owner, there could be no doubt of his liability
if it were shown that the obstruction was placed there purposely to
keep the licensee from entering the premises, or for the very purpose of
inflicting injury if an attempt be made to cross. As well might an
owner give permission to his neighbor to travel over his field and then
set a trap to hurt him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the owner of ground digs a pit or erects other dangerous
obstructions at a place where it is probable that persons or animals
may go and become injured, without using proper care to guard the
same, it is well settled in this state that there is a liability, and that the
owner must respond in damages for any injury incurred by such negligence.
Young <em>v.</em> Harvey, 16 Ind. 314; Graves <em>v.</em> Thomas, 95 Ind.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>361; Mayhew <em>v.</em> Burns, 103 Ind. 328; Penso <em>v.</em> McCormick, 125 Ind.
116.</p>

<p class='c007'>A barbed wire fence is not of itself an unlawful one, and the building
of such along a public highway is not necessarily a negligent act;
but yet, even in such case as that, there may be circumstances under
which a person building such a fence, in a negligent manner, will be
held liable for damages caused thereby. Sisk <em>v.</em> Crump, 112 Ind. 504.
All these cases proceed upon the assumption that the party whose negligence
caused the injury owed the other some duty which he failed
to perform, for, after all, negligence is nothing more nor less than the
failure to discharge some legal duty or obligation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even trespassers have some rights an owner is bound to respect.
If a person, without permission, should attempt to cross the field of
another, and tramp down his growing grain, it would not be contended,
we apprehend, that this gave the owner any right to kill the
trespasser, or even to seriously injure him unnecessarily. The use of
spring guns, traps, and other devices to catch and injure trespassing
persons or animals has been condemned both in this country and in
England. Hooker <em>v.</em> Miller, 37 Iowa, 613; Deane <em>v.</em> Clayton, 7 Taunt.
489. If such means may not be employed against trespassers, we do
not see upon what principle it can be held that it is proper to use them
against one who has a permissive right to go upon the property where
they are placed.</p>

<p class='c007'>While in the case at bar there may be no proof of intentional injury,
the facts, we think, bring the case within the principle declared in
Young <em>v.</em> Harvey, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>; Graves <em>v.</em> Thomas, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>; Penso <em>v.</em> McCormick,

<h5 class='c013'>INDERMAUR <em>v.</em> DAMES<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Common Pleas, February 26, 1866.</span><br /> <em>Reported in Law Reports, 1 Common Pleas, 274.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>The judgment of the Court (<span class='sc'>Erle, C. J.</span>, <span class='sc'>Willes</span>, <span class='sc'>Keating</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Montague Smith, JJ</span>.) was delivered by<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c015'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Willes, J.</span> This was an action to recover damages for hurt sustained
by the plaintiff’s falling down a shaft at the defendant’s place
of business, through the actionable negligence, as it was alleged, of the
defendant and his servants.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>At the trial before the Lord Chief Justice at the sittings here after
Michaelmas Term, the plaintiff had a verdict for 400<em>l.</em> damages,
subject to leave reserved.</p>

<p class='c007'>A rule was obtained by the defendant in last term to enter a nonsuit,
or to arrest the judgment, or for a new trial because of the
verdict being against the evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rule was argued during the last term, before Erle, C. J.,
Keating and Montague Smith, JJ., and myself, when we took time
to consider. We are now of opinion that the rule ought to be discharged.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears that the defendant was a sugar-refiner, at whose place of
business there was a shaft four feet three inches square, and twenty-nine
feet three inches deep, used for moving sugar. The shaft was
necessary, usual, and proper in the way of the defendant’s business.
Whilst it was in use, it was necessary and proper that it should be open
and unfenced. When it was not in use, it was sometimes necessary,
with reference to ventilation, that it should be open. It was not necessary
that it should, when not in use, be unfenced; and it might then
without injury to the business have been fenced by a rail. Whether it
was usual to fence similar shafts when not in use did not distinctly
appear; nor is it very material, because such protection was unquestionably
proper, in the sense of reasonable, with reference to the safety
of persons having a right to move about upon the floor where the shaft
in fact was, because in its nature it formed a pitfall there. At the time
of the accident it was not in use, and it was open and unfenced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff was a journeyman gas-fitter in the employ of a patentee
who had supplied the defendant with his patent gas-regulator, to
be paid for upon the terms that it effected a certain saving: and, for
the purpose of ascertaining whether such a saving had been effected,
the plaintiff’s employer required to test the action of the regulator.
He accordingly sent the plaintiff to the defendant’s place of business
for that purpose; and, whilst the plaintiff was engaged upon the floor
where the shaft was, he (under circumstances as to which the evidence
was conflicting, but) accidentally, and, as the jury found, without
any fault or negligence on his part, fell down the shaft, and was
seriously hurt.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was argued, that, as the defendant had objected to the plaintiff’s
working at the place upon a former occasion, he (the plaintiff) could
not be considered as having been in the place with the defendant’s
leave at the time of the accident: but the evidence did not establish
a peremptory or absolute objection to the plaintiff’s being employed,
so as to make the sending of him upon the occasion of the accident any
more against the defendant’s will than the sending of any other workman:
and the employment, and the implied authority resulting
therefrom to test the apparatus were not of a character involving
personal preference (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dilectus personæ</span></i>), so as to make it necessary that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the patentee should himself attend. It was not suggested that the
work was not journeyman’s work.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was also argued that the plaintiff was at best in the condition of
a bare licensee or guest who, it was urged, is only entitled to use the
place as he finds it, and whose complaint may be said to wear the color
of ingratitude, so long as there is no design to injure him: see Hounsell
<em>v.</em> Smyth, 7 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 371, 29 L. J. (C. P.) 203.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think this argument fails, because the capacity in which the
plaintiff was there was that of a person on lawful business, in the
course of fulfilling a contract in which both the plaintiff and the defendant
had an interest, and not upon bare permission. No sound
distinction was suggested between the case of the servant and the case
of the employer, if the latter had thought proper to go in person; nor
between the case of a person engaged in doing the work for the defendant
pursuant to his employment, and that of a person testing the work
which he had stipulated with the defendant to be paid for if it stood
the test; whereby impliedly the workman was to be allowed an on-stand
to apply that test, and a reasonable opportunity of doing so.
Any duty to enable the workman to do the work in safety, seems
equally to exist during the accessory employment of testing: and any
duty to provide for the safety of the master workman, seems equally
owing to the servant workman whom he may lawfully send in his
place.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is observable, that, in the case of Southcote <em>v.</em> Stanley, 1 H. &amp; N.
247, 25 L. J. (Ex.) 339, upon which much reliance was properly
placed for the defendant, Alderson, B., drew the distinction between a
bare licensee and a person coming on business, and Bramwell, B.,
between active negligence in respect of unusual danger known to the
host and not to the guest, and a bare defect of construction or repair,
which the host was only negligent in not finding out or anticipating
the consequence of.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is considerable resemblance, though not a strict analogy, between
this class of cases and those founded upon the rule as to voluntary
loans and gifts, that there is no remedy against the lender or giver
for damage sustained from the loan or gift, except in case of unusual
danger known to and concealed by the lender or giver. Macarthy <em>v.</em>
Younge, 6 H. &amp; N. 329, 30 L. J. (Ex.) 227. The case of the carboy
of vitriol<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c015'><sup>[151]</sup></a> was one in which this Court held answerable the bailor of
an unusually dangerous chattel, the quality of which he knew, but did
not tell the bailee, who did not know it, and, who as a proximate consequence
of his not knowing, and without any fault on his part,
suffered damage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cases referred to as to the liability for accidents to servants and
persons employed in other capacities in a business or profession which
necessarily and obviously exposes them to danger, as in Seymour <em>v.</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Maddox, 16 Q. B. 326, also have their special reasons. The servant
or other person so employed is supposed to undertake not only all the
ordinary risks of the employment into which he enters, but also all
extraordinary risks which he knows of and thinks proper to incur,
including those caused by the misconduct of his fellow-servants, not
however including those which can be traced to mere breach of duty
on the part of the master. In the case of a statutory duty to fence,
even the knowledge and reluctant submission of the servant who has
sustained an injury, are held to be only elements in determining
whether there has been contributory negligence: how far this is the
law between master and servant, where there is danger known to
the servant, and no statute for his protection, we need not now consider,
because the plaintiff in this case was not a servant of the defendant,
but the servant of the patentee. The question was adverted to,
but not decided, in Clarke <em>v.</em> Holmes, 7 H. &amp; N. 937, 31 L. J. (Ex.)
356.<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c015'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The authorities respecting guests and other bare licensees, and those
respecting servants and others who consent to incur a risk, being therefore
inapplicable, we are to consider what is the law as to the duty of
the occupier of a building with reference to persons resorting thereto
in the course of business, upon his invitation, express or implied. The
common case is that of a customer in a shop: but it is obvious that
this is only one of a class; for, whether the customer is actually
chaffering at the time, or actually buys or not, he is, according to an
undoubted course of authority and practice, entitled to the exercise of
reasonable care by the occupier to prevent damage from unusual
danger, of which the occupier knows or ought to know, such as a
trap-door left open, unfenced, and unlighted: Lancaster Canal Company
<em>v.</em> Parnaby, 11 Ad. &amp; E. 223, 3 P. &amp; D. 162; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per cur.</span></i> Chapman
<em>v.</em> Rothwell, E. B. &amp; E. 168, 27 L. J. (Q. B.) 315, where Southcote <em>v.</em>
Stanley, 1 H. &amp; N. 247, 25 L. J. (Ex.) 339, was cited, and the Lord
Chief Justice, then Erle, J., said: “The distinction is between the
case of a visitor (as the plaintiff was in Southcote <em>v.</em> Stanley), who
must take care of himself, and a customer, who, as one of the public,
is invited for the purposes of business carried on by the defendant.”
This protection does not depend upon the fact of a contract being
entered into in the way of the shopkeeper’s business during the stay
of the customer, but upon the fact that the customer has come into
the shop in pursuance of a tacit invitation given by the shopkeeper,
with a view to business which concerns himself. And, if a customer
were, after buying goods, to go back to the shop in order to complain
of the quality, or that the change was not right, he would be just as
much there upon business which concerned the shopkeeper, and as
much entitled to protection during this accessory visit, though it
might not be for the shopkeeper’s benefit, as during the principal visit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>which was. And if, instead of going himself, the customer were to
send his servant, the servant would be entitled to the same consideration
as the master.</p>

<p class='c007'>The class to which the customer belongs includes persons who go
not as mere volunteers, or licensees, or guests, or servants, or persons
whose employment is such that danger may be considered as bargained
for, but who go upon business which concerns the occupier, and upon
his invitation, express or implied.</p>

<p class='c007'>And, with respect to such a visitor at least, we consider it settled
law, that he, using reasonable care on his part for his own safety, is
entitled to expect that the occupier shall on his part use reasonable
care to prevent damage from unusual danger which he knows or ought
to know; and that, where there is evidence of neglect, the question
whether such reasonable care has been taken, by notice, lighting,
guarding or otherwise, and whether there was contributory negligence
in the sufferer, must be determined by a jury as matter of fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of Wilkinson <em>v.</em> Fairrie, 1 H. &amp; C. 633, 32 L. J. (Ex.)
73, relied upon for the defendant, the distinction was pointed out between
ordinary accidents, such as falling down stairs, which ought to
be imputed to the carelessness or misfortune of the sufferer, and accidents
from unusual, covert danger, such as that of falling down into
a pit.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was ably insisted for the defendant that he could only be bound to
keep his place of business in the same condition as other places of business
of the like kind, according to the best known mode of construction.
And this argument seems conclusive to prove that there was no
absolute duty to prevent danger, but only a duty to make the place as
little dangerous as such a place could reasonably be, having regard to
the contrivances necessarily used in carrying on the business. But we
think the argument is inapplicable to the facts of this case: first,
because it was not shown, and probably could not be, that there was
any usage never to fence shafts; secondly, because it was proved, that,
when the shaft was not in use, a fence might be resorted to without
inconvenience; and no usage could establish that what was in fact
unnecessarily dangerous was in law reasonably safe, as against persons
towards whom there was a duty to be careful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having fully considered the notes of the Lord Chief Justice, we
think there was evidence for the jury that the plaintiff was in the place
by the tacit invitation of the defendant, upon business in which he was
concerned; that there was by reason of the shaft unusual danger
known to the defendant; and that the plaintiff sustained damage by
reason of that danger, and of the neglect of the defendant and his
servants to use reasonably sufficient means to avert or warn him of
it: and we cannot say that the proof of contributory negligence was
so clear that we ought on this ground to set aside the verdict of the
jury.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>As for the argument that the plaintiff contributed to the accident by
not following his guide, the answer may be that the guide, knowing
the place, ought rather to have waited for him; and this point, as
matter of fact, is set at rest by the verdict.</p>

<p class='c007'>For these reasons, we think there was evidence of a cause of action
in respect of which the jury were properly directed; and, as every
reservation of leave to enter a nonsuit carries with it an implied condition
that the Court may amend, if necessary, in such a manner as to
raise the real question, leave ought to be given to the plaintiff, in the
event of the defendant desiring to appeal or to bring a writ of error, to
amend the declaration by stating the facts as proved,—in effect, that
the defendant was the occupier of and carried on business at the place;
that there was a shaft, very dangerous to persons in the place, which
the defendant knew and the plaintiff did not know; that the plaintiff,
by invitation and permission of the defendant, was near the shaft,
upon business of the defendant, in the way of his own craft as a gas-fitter,
for hire, &amp;c., stating the circumstances, the negligence, and
that by reason thereof the plaintiff was injured. The details of the
amendment can, if necessary, be settled at chambers.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the motion to arrest the judgment, for the reasons already
given, and upon condition that an amendment is to be made if and
when required by the defendant, it will follow the fate of the motion
to enter a nonsuit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other arguments for the defendant, to which we have not particularly
adverted, were no more than objections to the verdict as
being against the evidence: but it would be wrong to grant a new
trial without a reasonable expectation that another jury might take a
different view of the facts; and, as the Lord Chief Justice does not
express any dissatisfaction with the verdict, the rule upon this, the
only remaining ground, must also be discharged.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Tort, for personal injuries occasioned to the plaintiff by the fall of
an elevator upon which he was riding while in the defendant’s employ.
Trial in the Superior Court, before Mason, C. J., who directed the jury
to return a verdict for the defendant; and reported the case for the
determination of this court. If the case should have been submitted
to the jury, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff in a sum
named; otherwise, judgment on the verdict. The facts sufficiently
appear in the opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>The case was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Allen, J.</span> The general condition of the elevator was such that a
jury might find that the defendant would be negligent in continuing
its use for carrying workmen up and down while engaged in their
work, if this was done without warning them of the risk. It is true
that the particular defect which caused the accident was not open to
observation or easy to discover. But there was evidence tending to
show that the accident was caused by the use of the elevator while it
was in a condition which rendered it unsuitable for use, and that the
defendant was fairly put upon inquiry as to its safety; and that the
defendant’s duty in this respect was different from and greater than
that of the workmen themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question then remains whether the posting of the notices in
the elevator<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c015'><sup>[154]</sup></a> showed such a performance by the defendant of its duty
of warning or cautioning the workmen, or such contributory negligence
or assumption of the risk on the part of the plaintiff, as to entitle
the defendant to have the case withdrawn from the jury. While
upon the evidence reported a verdict for the defendant would be more
satisfactory, we are unable to hold that the defendant was entitled to
such verdict as a matter of law. As a general rule, the sufficiency of
such warning or caution is a question of fact for the jury. Indermaur
<em>v.</em> Dames, L. R. 1 C. P. 274; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span> L. R. 2 C. P. 311. It is true that
the plaintiff was not at liberty to shut his eyes in order to avoid reading
a plain notice of warning. If it be assumed that the plaintiff must
be held chargeable with a knowledge of the contents of the notice,
or at least that the defendant performed its duty of cautioning the
workmen by posting the notices in the elevator, we think the plaintiff
still had the right to go to the jury upon the question whether
the notices remained in force at the time of the accident, or had become
a dead letter. There was evidence tending to show that the
notices were put in the elevator a long time before the accident by a
former treasurer whose connection with the company had then ceased,
that they had become soiled and somewhat indistinct and torn, and
that all of the defendant’s workmen, including the general superintendent
of the building, were in the regular habit of using the elevator
to carry them up and down, and had been so for some months prior
to the accident. There was room for a legitimate argument that the
defendant could not have intended to keep such a rule in force forever,
and to furnish an elevator for permanent use by the men at their
own sole risk; and that the defendant expected the men to use it while
they were engaged in its work, and that it was for the defendant’s advantage
that they should do so, from the saving of time thereby secured.
It might be found that the plaintiff, even if he knew of the terms
of the notice, might nevertheless assume that its force had ceased.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>If one who has posted a notice of entire prohibition permits it to be
habitually disregarded, as, for instance, a notice not to ride on the
platform of a street railway car, or in the baggage car of a train, a
practical invitation to violate it may be inferred from habitual usage
which is known to him. Long continued practice to the contrary may
have the effect to supersede or show a waiver of the rule. O’Donnell
<em>v.</em> Allegheny Valley Railroad, 59 Penn. St. 239; Pennsylvania Railroad
<em>v.</em> Langdon, 92 Penn. St. 21; Waterbury <em>v.</em> New York Central &amp;

<p class='c014'>Tort, by the owner of the coal barge Western Belle, for injury to
that vessel by grounding on a ledge of rock embedded in the mud at
the bottom of the defendant’s dock at Rockland, Maine.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Superior Court the case was tried by a judge without a jury.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It appeared at the trial that defendant was part owner of a dock,
and used it for the discharge of cargoes of coal consigned to it. Plaintiff
had sold coal to the defendant, and sent it a barge loaded therewith.”<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c015'><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff requested the judge to make certain rulings, including
the following:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“4. It is not necessary for the plaintiff to show that the defendant
knew of the ledge; it is sufficient if its existence could have been
discovered by reasonable diligence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge refused to make any of the rulings, and found for the
defendant. The plaintiff excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lathrop, J.</span>... The general rules of law which are applicable in
cases of this character are the same in England and in this country,
and are the same at common law and in admiralty. They are as well
stated in the case of Nickerson <em>v.</em> Tirrell, 127 Mass. 236, 239, as perhaps
in any case: “The owner or occupant of a dock is liable in damages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>to a person who, by his invitation express or implied, makes use
of it, for an injury caused by any defect or unsafe condition of the
dock which the occupant negligently causes or permits to exist, if
such person was himself in the exercise of due care. Such occupant
is not an insurer of the safety of his dock,<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c015'><sup>[157]</sup></a> but he is required to use
reasonable care to keep his dock in such a state as to be reasonably
safe for use by vessels which he invites to enter it, or for which he
holds it out as fit and ready. If he fails to use such due care, if there
is a defect which is known to him, or which by the use of ordinary
care and diligence should be known to him, he is guilty of negligence
and liable to the person who, using due care, is injured thereby.

<p class='c007'>It is clear that the vessel was in the defendant’s dock on business, and
was, therefore, there by invitation. The judge has found, and the evidence
shows, that the injury was caused by a ledge of rocks embedded
in the mud at the bottom of the dock. The questions of fact which
he did not pass upon are whether the master was in the exercise of
due care, and whether the defendant knew of the defect or could
by the exercise of reasonable care and diligence have ascertained its
existence.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>From Superior Court of Marion County; Vincent G. Clifford,
Special Judge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Action by George J. Dawson against the Indianapolis Street Railway
Company. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Roby, J.</span> Action by appellee. Verdict and judgment for $500.
Demurrers to first and second paragraphs of complaint overruled.
Motion for a new trial overruled.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is averred in the first paragraph of complaint, in substance, as
extracted from a multitude of words, that appellant was on August
25, 1901, a corporation operating a street railway system in Indianapolis
and was a common carrier for hire; that it owned a park near
said city, and maintained certain attractions therein to induce persons
to ride on its cars, inviting them to said park; that on the day
named it gave a free band concert therein, the same having been
extensively advertised prior thereto; that on said day appellee, accompanied
by a lady, took passage upon one of its regular cars, and
was conveyed to said park; that a large number of persons were daily
transported thereto, among them a large number of lawless persons
who were hostile to colored people, of whom appellee was one, their
names being unknown to plaintiff, and who had long before said day
entered into a conspiracy “to suppress, molest, assault, and insult
colored people generally who might visit said park;” that in pursuance
of such conspiracy said persons assaulted and beat appellee,
and drove him from the park; that he and his companion demeaned
themselves in a ladylike and gentlemanly manner, but upon arriving
at the park were set upon by a large number of white boys and young
men, appellee being assaulted and beaten by them; that appellant
had, and had had for a long time prior to said day, full notice and
knowledge of said conditions, and of the unlawful purposes aforesaid,
and of acts of violence committed thereunder, but took no steps to
prevent such conduct; that early in the afternoon of said day said
lawless men and boys began marching and drilling openly in said
park preparatory to an attack upon any colored male person who
should be found there later, appellant taking no steps to prevent such
conduct or to notify colored people of the danger, although it had
knowledge thereof; that neither appellant nor its officers made any
objection to the open and notorious gathering of white men and boys
for the unlawful purpose stated; that it was negligent and indifferent
in not employing and using a sufficient number of guards and policemen
to maintain the peace; that two of its guards or policemen aided
and abetted the wrong done appellee by standing by when he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>being unmercifully beaten by said crowd of lawless white men and
boys, and offering him no assistance, although they were able to do
so, and could have prevented injury to him. “Wherefore, by reason
of the matters therein stated, the plaintiff has been damaged,” etc.
The second paragraph of complaint is somewhat more extended than
the first one, but for the purpose of this opinion the statement made
is sufficient.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pleading charges appellant with notice of the alleged conspiracy,
with acquiescence therein, and, by its guards or policemen, with
passive participation in the actual assault made upon appellee.
“When one expressly or by implication invites others to come upon his
premises, whether for business or any other purpose, it is his duty
to be reasonably sure that he is not inviting them into danger, and to
that end he must exercise ordinary care and prudence to render the
place reasonably safe for the visit.” Cooley, Torts (2d ed.), 718;
Howe <em>v.</em> Ohmart, 7 Ind. App. 32, 38; Richmond, etc., R. Co. <em>v.</em> Moore,
94 Va. 493, 37 L. R. A. 258; North Manchester, etc., Assn. <em>v.</em> Wilcox,
4 Ind. App. 141; Penso <em>v.</em> McCormick, 125 Ind. 116, 21 Am. St.
211.</p>

<p class='c007'>No case has been cited or found where the premises upon which the
injury complained of occurred, and to which the complainant came by
invitation, were made unsafe through a conspiracy of the nature set up
herein. Danger usually has been attributed to some defect in the
premises themselves. But as a matter of principle it is quite as reprehensible
to invite one knowing an enemy is awaiting him with the
intent to assault and beat him as it would be to invite him without
having made the floor or the stairway secure. One attending an agricultural
fair in response to a general invitation extended to the public
has been awarded damages against the association where his horse
was killed by target shooting upon a part of the ground allowed for
such purpose. Conradt <em>v.</em> Clauve, 93 Ind. 476, 47 Am. Rep. 388.</p>

<p class='c007'>Recoveries have also been sustained: When spectators rushed upon
a race-track, causing a collision between horses being driven thereon.
North Manchester, etc., Assn. <em>v.</em> Wilcox, 4 Ind. App. 141. When an
opening was left in a fence surrounding a race-track through which
one of the horses, running, went among the spectators. Windeler <em>v.</em>
Rush County Fair Assn., 27 Ind. App. 92. Where horses were started
on a race-track in opposite directions at the same time, causing collision.
Fairmount, etc., Assn. <em>v.</em> Downey, 146 Ind. 503. Where a horse
with a vicious habit of track bolting was permitted to run in a race,
such horse bolting the track, causing injury. Lane <em>v.</em> Minnesota, etc.,
Soc., 62 Minn. 175, 29 L. R. A. 708. Recognizing the rule of reasonable
care to make the premises safe, a recovery was denied in the
absence of any evidence of the immediate cause of a horse running
through the crowds. Hart <em>v.</em> Washington Park Club, 157 Ill. 9, 29
L. R. A. 492. Where a street car company maintained a park as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>place of attraction for passengers over its line, the falling of a pole
used by one making a balloon ascension, under a contract, injuring a
bystander, recovery was allowed, the rule being announced that the
company must use proper care to protect its patrons from danger
while on its grounds. Richmond, etc., R. Co. <em>v.</em> Moore, 94 Va. 493,
37 L. R. A. 258. Where a street car company maintained a large
stage for exhibitions, in a pleasure resort owned by it, and made a
written contract with a manager, by which the latter furnished various
entertainments, among which was target shooting, one injured
by a split bullet was allowed to recover, it being held that he might
safely rely on those who provided the exhibition and invited his
attendance to take due care to make the place safe from such injury
as he received, the question of due care being one for the jury. Thompson
<em>v.</em> Lowell, etc., St. R. Co., 170 Mass. 577, 40 L. R. A. 345; Curtis
<em>v.</em> Kiley, 153 Mass. 123.</p>

<p class='c007'>The duty of common carriers to protect their passengers from injury
on account of unlawful violence by persons not connected with
their service has frequently furnished material for judicial consideration.
The New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals approved an exhaustive
and carefully considered opinion delivered by the Supreme
Court of that State to the effect that a passenger who, while attempting
to have her baggage checked, was knocked down and injured by
cabmen, in no sense servants of the carrier, scuffling on a passageway
under its control, might recover against it. Exton <em>v.</em> Central R.
Co., 63 N. J. L. 356, 56 L. R. A. 508. In what seems to have been a
pioneer case, it was held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in
1866, that it was the duty of the trainmen on a passenger-train to
exert the forces at their disposal to prevent injury to passengers by
others fighting in the car. Pittsburgh, etc., R. Co. <em>v.</em> Hinds, 53 Pa.
St. 512. Ten years later the Supreme Court of Mississippi, after very
exhaustive arguments by eminent counsel of national reputation,
reached the same conclusion. New Orleans, etc., R. Co. <em>v.</em> Burke, 53
Miss. 200.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without further elaboration it may safely be said that the unusual
character of an alleged peril, from which it is averred the appellant
did not use due care to protect its visitors, does not affect the right of
recovery, it being otherwise justified. The demurrers were therefore
correctly overruled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidence was introduced of other prior assaults at said park upon
colored persons, and articles previously published by daily newspapers
in the city describing such occurrences were also admitted.
In order to determine whether appellant used due care, it was essential
to show its knowledge or means of information relative to the conditions
alleged to exist, rendering it dangerous for appellee to visit the
park. The evidence of similar occurrences was competent as tending
to show notice of the conditions. Toledo, etc., R. Co. <em>v.</em> Milligan, 2
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Ind. App. 578; City of Delphi <em>v.</em> Lowery, 74 Ind. 520, 39 Am. Rep.
98; City of Goshen <em>v.</em> England, 119 Ind. 368, 375.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts upon which appellant’s liability depends otherwise than
heretofore considered were questions for the determination of the
jury. There was evidence tending to establish, and from which the
jury might properly find, the existence of such facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Appellant and its officers appear to have displayed indifference to
the conditions existing which it and they could not well help knowing.
This may have been due to the idea, sometimes entertained, that
as to acts of lawlessness it is a sufficient duty of citizenship to be
indifferent. Such idea is entirely erroneous.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>SWEENY <em>v.</em> OLD COLONY RAILROAD COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, January Term, 1865.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 10 Allen, 368.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Tort to recover damages for a personal injury sustained by being
run over by the defendants’ cars, while the plaintiff was crossing their
railroad by license, on a private way leading from South Street to
Federal Street, in Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial in this Court, before Chapman, J., it appeared that this
private way, which is called Lehigh Street, was made by the South
Cove Corporation for their own benefit, and that they own the fee of
it; that it is wrought as a way, and buildings are erected on each side
of it, belonging to the owners of the way, and there has been much
crossing there by the public for several years. The defendants, having
rightfully taken the land under their charter, not subject to any right
of way, made a convenient plank-crossing and kept a flagman at the
end of it on South Street, partly to protect their own property, and
partly to protect the public. They have never made any objection to
such crossing, so far as it did not interfere with their cars and engines.
There are several tracks at the crossing. The only right of the public
to use the crossing is under the license implied by the facts stated
above.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the day of the accident, the defendants had a car at their depot
which they had occasion to run over to their car house. It was attached
to an engine and taken over the crossing, and to a proper distance
beyond the switch. The coupling-pin was then taken out, the
engine reversed, and it was moved towards the car house by the side
track. The engine was provided with a good engineer and fireman,
and the car with a brakeman; the bell was constantly rung, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>defendants were not guilty of any negligence in respect to the management
of the car or engine.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the engine and car were coming from the depot, the plaintiff,
with a horse and a wagon loaded with empty beer barrels, was coming
down South Street from the same direction. There was evidence tending
to show that, as he approached the crossing, the flagman, who was
at his post, made a signal to him with his flag to stop, which he did;
that, in answer to an inquiry by the plaintiff whether he could then
cross, he then made another signal with his flag, indicating that it was
safe to cross; that the plaintiff started and attempted to cross, looking
straight forward; that he saw the car coming near him as it went
towards the car house; and that he jumped forward from his wagon,
and the car knocked him down and ran over him and broke both his
legs. It struck the fore-wheel of his wagon and also his horse. If he
had remained in his wagon, or had not jumped forwards, or had kept
about the middle of the crossing, the evidence showed that he would
not have been injured personally. His wagon was near the left-hand
side of the plank-crossing as he went.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants contended that, even if the plaintiff used ordinary
care, and if the flagman carelessly and negligently gave the signal that
he might cross, when in fact it was unsafe to do so on account of the
approaching car, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, because the
license to people to use the crossing was not a license to use it at
the risk of the defendants, but to use it as they best could when not
forbidden, taking care of their own safety, and going at their own risk;
and also, that if the flagman made a signal to the plaintiff that he
might cross, he exceeded his authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the evidence being very contradictory as to the care used by the
plaintiff, and also as to the care used by the flagman, the judge ruled,
for the purpose of taking a verdict upon these two facts, that the defendants
had a right to use the crossing as they did on this occasion,
and that they were not bound to keep a flagman there; yet, since they
did habitually keep one there, they would be responsible to the plaintiff
for the injury done to him by the car, provided he used due care,
if he was induced to cross by the signal made to him by the flagman,
and if that signal was carelessly or negligently made at a time when
it was unsafe to cross on account of the movement of the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $7500; and the case
was reserved for the consideration of the whole Court.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>J. G. Abbott</em> and <em>P. H. Sears</em>, for the defendants. The defendants
had, for all purposes incident to the complete enjoyment of their franchise,
the right of exclusive possession and use of the place where the
accident happened, against the owners of the fee, and still more against
all other persons. Hazen <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, 2 Gray, 574;
Brainard <em>v.</em> Clapp, 10 Cush. 6; Gen. Stat. c. 63, §§ 102, 103. The
defendants were not bound to keep a flagman there, or exercise the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>other precautions prescribed for the crossing of highways or travelled
places. Gen. Stat. c. 63, §§ 64–66, 83–91; Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad
<em>v.</em> Old Colony Railroad, 12 Cush. 608. The license or permission,
if any, to the plaintiff to pass over the premises did not impose
any duty on the defendants, but he took the permission, with its concomitant
perils, at his own risk. Howland <em>v.</em> Vincent, 10 Met. 371,
374; Scott <em>v.</em> London Docks Co., 11 Law Times (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>), 383; Chapman
<em>v.</em> Rothwell, El. Bl. &amp; El. 168; Southcote <em>v.</em> Stanley, 1 Hurlst.

Blithe <em>v.</em> Topham, 1 Rol. Ab. 88; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span> 1 Vin. Ab. 555, pl. 4; Cro. Jac.
158. The defendants did not hold out to the plaintiff an invitation
to pass over. Hounsell <em>v.</em> Smyth and Binks <em>v.</em> South Yorkshire Railway,
above cited. The allowing or making of such private crossing
was not in itself such an invitation, and did not involve the duty of
such precautions. The keeping of a flagman there was wholly for the
purpose of preventing persons from crossing, not for the purpose of
holding out invitations at any time. The signal that the plaintiff
might cross was in answer to his inquiry, and was, at most, only revoking
the prohibition, or granting permission; it was not holding out
an invitation. The duty of the flagman was simply to warn persons
against crossing; and if the flagman held out an invitation or even
gave permission to the plaintiff to cross, he went beyond the scope of
his employment, and the defendants are not liable on account thereof.
Lygo <em>v.</em> Newbold, 9 Exch. 203; Middleton <em>v.</em> Fowle, 1 Salk. 282. Even
if the defendants had carelessly held out an invitation to the plaintiff
to cross, still they would not be liable; for the report shows that after
such supposed invitation the plaintiff might, by the exercise of ordinary
care, have avoided the injury; that the plaintiff was himself at
the time in the wrong; and that his own negligence and fault contributed
to the accident. Todd <em>v.</em> Old Colony &amp; Fall River Railroad,
7 Allen, 207; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span> 3 Allen, 18, and cases cited; Denny <em>v.</em> Williams, 5
Allen, 1, and cases cited; Spofford <em>v.</em> Harlow, 3 Allen, 177, and cases
cited.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bigelow, C. J.</span> This case has been presented with great care on
the part of the learned counsel for the defendants, who have produced
before us all the leading authorities bearing on the question of law
which was reserved at the trial. We have not found it easy to decide
on which side of the line which marks the limit of the defendant’s
liability for damages caused by the acts of their agents, the case at bar
falls. But on careful consideration we have been brought to the conclusion
that the rulings at the trial were right, and that we cannot set
aside the verdict for the plaintiff on the ground that it was based on
erroneous instructions in matter of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to maintain an action for an injury to person or property by
reason of negligence or want of due care, there must be shown to exist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>some obligation or duty towards the plaintiff, which the defendant has
left undischarged or unfulfilled. This is the basis on which the cause
of action rests. There can be no fault, or negligence, or breach of
duty, where there is no act, or service, or contract, which a party is
bound to perform or fulfil. All the cases in the books, in which a party
is sought to be charged on the ground that he has caused a way or
other place to be incumbered or suffered it to be in a dangerous condition,
whereby accident and injury have been occasioned to another,
turn on the principle that negligence consists in doing or omitting to
do an act by which a legal duty or obligation has been violated. Thus
a trespasser who comes on the land of another without right cannot
maintain an action, if he runs against a barrier or falls into an excavation
there situated. The owner of the land is not bound to protect
or provide safeguards for wrong-doers. So a licensee, who enters
on premises by permission only, without an enticement, allurement,
or inducement being held out to him by the owner or occupant, cannot
recover damages for injuries caused by obstructions or pitfalls.
He goes there at his own risk, and enjoys the license subject to its concomitant
perils. No duty is imposed by law on the owner or occupant
to keep his premises in a suitable condition for those who come there
solely for their own convenience or pleasure, and who are not either
expressly invited to enter or induced to come upon them by the purpose
for which the premises are appropriated and occupied, or by some
preparation or adaptation of the place for use by customers or passengers,
which might naturally and reasonably lead them to suppose that
they might properly and safely enter thereon.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, there are cases where houses or lands are so situated,
or their mode of occupation and use is such, that the owner or
occupant is not absolved from all care for the safety of those who come
on the premises, but where the law imposes on him an obligation or
duty to provide for their security against accident and injury. Thus
the keeper of a shop or store is bound to provide means of safe ingress
and egress to and from his premises for those having occasion to enter
thereon, and is liable in damages for any injury which may happen by
reason of any negligence in the mode of constructing or managing the
place of entrance and exit. So the keeper of an inn or other place of
public resort would be liable to an action in favor of a person who
suffered an injury in consequence of an obstruction or defect in the
way or passage which was held out and used as the common and proper
place of access to the premises. The general rule or principle applicable
to this class of cases is, that an owner or occupant is bound to keep
his premises in a safe and suitable condition for those who come upon
and pass over them, using due care, if he has held out any invitation,
allurement, or inducement, either express or implied, by which they
have been led to enter thereon. A mere naked license or permission
to enter or pass over an estate will not create a duty or impose an obligation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>on the part of the owner or person in possession to provide
against the danger of accident. The gist of the liability consists in
the fact that the person injured did not act merely for his own convenience
and pleasure, and from motives to which no act or sign of
the owner or occupant contributed, but that he entered the premises
because he was led to believe that they were intended to be used by
visitors or passengers, and that such use was not only acquiesced in
by the owner or person in possession and control of the premises, but
that it was in accordance with the intention and design with which the
way or place was adapted and prepared or allowed to be so used. The
true distinction is this: A mere passive acquiescence by an owner or
occupier in a certain use of his land by others involves no liability;
but if he directly or by implication induces persons to enter on and
pass over his premises, he thereby assumes an obligation that they are
in a safe condition, suitable for such use, and for a breach of this
obligation he is liable in damages to a person injured thereby.</p>

<p class='c007'>This distinction is fully recognized in the most recent and best considered
cases in the English Courts, and may be deemed to be the
pivot on which all cases like the one at bar are made to turn. In Corby
<em>v.</em> Hill, 4 C. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 556, the owner of land, having a private road
for the use of persons coming to his house, gave permission to a builder
engaged in erecting a house on the land to place materials on the road;
the plaintiff, having occasion to use the road for the purpose of going
to the owner’s residence, ran against the materials and sustained damage,
for which the owner was held liable. Cockburn, C. J., says: “The
proprietors of the soil held out an allurement whereby the plaintiff was
induced to come on the place in question; they held this road out to all
persons having occasion to proceed to the house as the means of access
thereto.” In Chapman <em>v.</em> Rothwell, El. Bl. &amp; El. 168, the proprietor
of a brewery was held liable in damages for injury and loss of life
caused by permitting a trap-door to be open without sufficient light or
proper safeguards, in a passageway through which access was had
from the street to his office. This decision was put on the ground that
the defendant, by holding out the passageway as the proper mode of
approach to his office and brewery, invited the party injured to go
there, and was bound to use due care in providing for his safety. This
is the point on which the decision turned, as stated by Keating, J., in
Hounsell <em>v.</em> Smyth, 7 C. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 738. In the last-named case the
distinction is clearly drawn between the liability of a person who holds
out an inducement or invitation to others to enter on his premises by
preparing a way or path by means of which they can gain access to his
house or store, or pass into or over the land, and in a case where nothing
is shown but a bare license or permission tacitly given to go upon
or through an estate, and the responsibility of finding a safe and secure
passage is thrown on the passenger and not on the owner. The same
distinction is stated in Barnes <em>v.</em> Ward, 9 C. B. 392; Hardcastle <em>v.</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>South Yorkshire Railway, &amp;c., 4 Hurlst. &amp; Norm. 67; and Binks <em>v.</em>
South Yorkshire Railway, &amp;c., 32 Law Journ. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) Q. B. 26. In
the last cited case the language of Blackburn, J., is peculiarly applicable
to the case at bar. He says, “There might be a case where
permission to use land as a path may amount to such an inducement
as to lead the persons using it to suppose it a highway, and
thus induce them to use it as such.” See also, for a clear statement
of the difference between cases where an invitation or allurement is
held out by the defendant, and those where nothing appears but a
mere license or permission to enter on premises, Bolch <em>v.</em> Smith, 7
Hurlst. &amp; Norm. 741, and Scott <em>v.</em> London Docks Co., 11 Law Times
(<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>), 383.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts disclosed at the trial of the case now before us, carefully
weighed and considered, bring it within that class in which parties
have been held liable in damages by reason of having held out an invitation
or inducement to persons to enter upon and pass over their
premises. It cannot in any just view of the evidence be said that the
defendants were passive only, and gave merely a tacit license or assent
to the use of the place in question as a public crossing. On the contrary,
the place or crossing was situated between two streets of the city
(which are much frequented thoroughfares), and was used by great
numbers of people who had occasion to pass from one street to the
other, and it was fitted and prepared by the defendants with a convenient
plank-crossing, such as is usually constructed in highways,
where they are crossed by the tracks of a railroad, in order to facilitate
the passage of animals and vehicles over the rails. It had been so
maintained by the defendants for a number of years. These facts
would seem to bring the case within the principle already stated, that
the license to use the crossing had been used and enjoyed under such
circumstances as to amount to an inducement, held out by the defendants
to persons having occasion to pass, to believe that it was a highway,
and to use it as such. But the case does not rest on these facts
only. The defendants had not only constructed and fitted the crossing
in the same manner as if it had been a highway, but they had employed
a person to stand there with a flag, and to warn persons who were
about to pass over the railroad when it was safe for them to attempt to
cross with the vehicles and animals, without interference or collision
with the engines and cars of the defendants. And it was also shown
that when the plaintiff started to go over the tracks with his wagon, it
was in obedience to a signal from this agent of the defendants that
there was no obstruction or hindrance to his safe passage over the
railroad. These facts well warranted the jury in finding, as they must
have done in rendering a verdict for the plaintiff under the instructions
of the Court, that the defendants induced the plaintiff to cross
at the time when he attempted to do so, and met with the injury for
which he now seeks compensation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>It was suggested that the person employed by the defendants to
stand near the crossing with a flag exceeded his authority in giving a
signal to the plaintiff that it was safe for him to pass over the crossing
just previously to the accident, and that no such act was within the
scope of his employment, which was limited to the duty of preventing
persons from passing at times when it was dangerous to do so. But it
seems to us that this is a refinement and distinction which the facts do
not justify. It is stated in the report that the flagman was stationed
at the place in question, charged among other things with the duty of
protecting the public. This general statement of the object for which
the agent was employed, taken in connection with the fact that he was
stationed at a place constructed and used as a public way by great
numbers of people, clearly included the duty of indicating to persons
when it was safe for them to pass, as well as when it was prudent or
necessary for them to refrain from passing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor do we think it can be justly said that the flagman in fact held
out no inducement to the plaintiff to pass. No express invitation need
have been shown. It would have been only necessary for the plaintiff
to prove that the agent did some act to indicate that there was no risk
of accident in attempting to pass over the crossing. The evidence at
the trial was clearly sufficient to show that the agent of the defendants
induced the plaintiff to pass, and that he acted in so doing within
the scope of the authority conferred on him. The question whether the
plaintiff was so induced was distinctly submitted to the jury by the
Court; nor do we see any reason for supposing that the instructions
on this point were misunderstood or misapplied by the jury. If they
lacked fulness, the defendants should have asked for more explicit instructions.
Certainly the evidence as reported well warranted the
finding of the jury on this point.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was also urged that, if the defendants were held liable in this
action, they would be made to suffer by reason of the fact that they
had taken precautions to guard against accident at the place in question,
which they were not bound to use, and that the case would present
the singular aspect of holding a party liable for neglect in the
performance of a duty voluntarily assumed, and which was not imposed
by the rules of law. But this is by no means an anomaly. If
a person undertakes to do an act or discharge a duty by which the
conduct of others may properly be regulated and governed, he is bound
to perform it in such manner that those who rightfully are led to a
course of conduct or action on the faith that the act or duty will be
duly and properly performed shall not suffer loss or injury by reason
of his negligence. The liability in such cases does not depend on the
motives or considerations which induced a party to take on himself a
particular task or duty, but on the question whether the legal rights
of others have been violated by the mode in which the charge assumed
has been performed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>The Court were not requested at the trial to withdraw the case from
the jury on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to show he was in
the exercise of due care at the time the accident happened. Upon the
evidence, as stated in the report, we cannot say, as matter of law, that
the plaintiff did not establish this part of his case.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the above decision was rendered, the verdict was set aside, by

<h5 class='c013'>STEVENS <em>v.</em> NICHOLS<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, February 23, 1892.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 155 Massachusetts Reports, 472.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Tort, to recover for injuries occasioned to the plaintiff by driving
over a curbstone covered with snow in a private way controlled by the
defendants. At the trial in the Superior Court, Mason, C. J., at the
defendants’ request, ruled that, upon the pleadings and the plaintiff’s
opening, he could not maintain the action, and ordered a verdict for
the defendants; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions. The facts, so
far as material to the points decided, appear in the opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>John L. Thorndike</em>, for the defendants.<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c015'><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This case bears no resemblance to Holmes <em>v.</em> Drew, 151 Mass. 578,
where the defendant had constructed a brick sidewalk by the side of a
public street, partly on her own land and partly in the street, without
any line of separation, and so that the whole was apparently part of
the street, and the defendant clearly intended that it should be used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>as part of the street. There is no similarity between such an addition
to the apparent width of a public street and the opening of a private
avenue or way out of a public street. The private way could not have
been, or intended to be, part of the public street, and the separation
between them was plain....</p>

<p class='c007'>The absence of similarity between this case and Holmes <em>v.</em> Drew,
151 Mass. 578, has already been pointed out; but it is also submitted
that that case is the first in which it has ever been held that the owner
of land was under any obligation to make it safe for a person that was
allowed to come upon the land for his own convenience, and for a purpose
in which the owner had no interest, whether the owner gave his
consent in the form of a permission or in the form of what might, in
common language, be called an invitation. Such persons were called
licensees, and must take the land as they found it, subject only to this,
that the owner must not lead them into danger by “something like
fraud.” Gautret <em>v.</em> Egerton, L. R. 2 C. P. 371, 374–375; Reardon <em>v.</em>
Thompson, 149 Mass. 267, 268; Pollock on Torts, 424–426....</p>

<p class='c007'>But as regards persons coming upon land at the request, actual or
tacit, of the owner upon business or for a purpose in which the owner
had an <em>interest</em>, it was his duty to make it reasonably safe, and he was
liable for damages arising from a neglect of this duty. Indermaur <em>v.</em>
Dames, L. R. 1 C. P. 274, 2 C. P. 311; Carleton <em>v.</em> Franconia Iron &amp;
Steel Co., 99 Mass. 216 (rock by wharf at which vessel unloaded);
The Moorcock, 14 P. D. 64 (a similar case); Davis <em>v.</em> Central Congregational
Society, 129 Mass. 367 (plaintiff attending a conference of
churches at defendant’s meeting-house, an object in which both parties
had an interest; also, p. 371, “a dangerous place without warning”);
Pollock on Torts, 415–418.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is this <em>common interest</em>, not the form of the license or invitation,
that creates the liability (Holmes <em>v.</em> North Eastern Ry. Co., L. R.
4 Ex. 254, 6 Ex. 123).</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction between these two classes of cases is that in one the
owner of the land has an interest in the person’s coming there, while
in the other the authority to come upon the land is a pure <em>gratuity</em>.
It is reasonable that the owner should undertake some duty in respect
of the condition of the land when he brings another person there for
an object in which he himself has an interest. But there is no reason
why he should undertake any such duty when he makes a gift of the
privilege of going upon his land. The privilege is only a gift, whether
the owner gives it because it is asked for, or whether he offers it first,
or asks or “invites” the other to accept it. It may in a sense be said
that a person is “induced” to go upon land by a license or permission
of the owner, but the real inducement is his own convenience. When
the owner asks him to walk over his land whenever it is agreeable to
him, and he goes there, he does so because it is agreeable to him, and
not because the owner asks him. He is in law a <em>licensee</em> going upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>land for his own convenience by the owner’s permission, and not a person
brought there for a purpose in which the owner has an interest.<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c015'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><em>Licensees</em>, however, have a right to expect that the owner will not
create a new danger while the license continues, and he is liable for
the consequences if he does create such a danger; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</span></i>, by making an
excavation near a path, as in Oliver <em>v.</em> Worcester, 102 Mass. 489, 502,
or by placing an obstruction in an avenue, as in Corby <em>v.</em> Hill, 4 C. B.
<span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 556, 567, or by carelessly throwing a keg into a passageway, as
in Corrigan <em>v.</em> Union Sugar Refinery, 98 Mass. 577, or by negligent
management of trains at a private crossing of a railway habitually
used by the public with the assent of the company, as in Sweeny <em>v.</em>
Old Colony Rld. Co., 10 Allen, 368; Murphy <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Albany Rld.
Co., 133 Mass. 121; Hanks <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Albany Rld. Co., 147 Mass.
495; Byrne <em>v.</em> New York Central Rld. Co., 104 N. Y. 362; Swift <em>v.</em>
Staten Island Rld. Co., 123 N. Y. 645; Taylor <em>v.</em> Delaware &amp; Hudson
Canal Co., 113 Pa. St. 162, 175.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principle of these cases is stated by Willes, J., in Gautret <em>v.</em>
Egerton, L. R. 2 C. P., p. 373, as follows: “If I dedicate a way to the
public which is full of ruts and holes, the public must take it as it is.
If I dig a pit in it, I may be liable for the consequences; but, if I do
nothing, I am not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The same principle is alluded to in June <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Albany Rld.
Co., 153 Mass. p. 82, where the court speaks of “cases in which even
unintended damage done to a licensee by actively bringing force to
bear upon his person will stand differently from merely passively
leaving land in a dangerous condition.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>The cases above mentioned include all that are cited in Holmes <em>v.</em>
Drew, 151 Mass. 580. In none of them is it held or suggested that
the railway company was liable for any defect or obstruction in the
crossing, or that the landowner was liable for any excavation or obstruction
existing when the permission was granted.</p>

<p class='c007'>[After citing cases where the court said that some kind of inducement
or invitation was necessary to create a liability for want of care
in running trains.] But it was not suggested that the inducement or
invitation would create any liability for defects in the crossing itself
which the company gratuitously allowed the public to use.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Referring to cases where there is implied license to the public to
use a crossing.] The probability known to the company that some
one may be there in pursuance of the license is treated&#160;... as the
ground of liability in such cases for want of care in running trains....
But there is nothing in any of the cases above mentioned tending
to support the proposition that the knowledge of the habitual use
of the crossing, pursuant to the implied permission, would create a
liability for defects in the crossing itself or impose any kind of duty
to make it safe or convenient.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>Holmes <em>v.</em> Drew (151 Mass. 578) does not belong to either of the
two last classes of cases. The plaintiff (1) did not go there upon the
defendant’s land for any purpose in which the defendant was interested,
and (2) the defendant did nothing to make the place less safe
than it was when it was first opened to the public. The plaintiff was
a volunteer, going upon the defendant’s land with her full permission,
but entirely for his own convenience. These distinctions do not appear
to have been called to the attention of the court. The judgment,
which is very short, seems to proceed upon the ground that the defendant,
by paving a footway partly on her own land and allowing it
to remain apparently a part of the street, showed an <em>intention</em> that it
should be used by foot passengers, and that this would amount to an
<em>implied invitation</em>, which imposed on her a duty to make it reasonably
safe. If this is to be taken literally, a permission ceases to be a
<em>license</em> if it is <em>intended</em> that it shall be used; and an invitation imposes
the same duty when it is given gratuitously for the pleasure of the
donee as when it is given for an object in which the giver has an interest;
and the owner of land that gives permission to cross his land
can escape liability only by proving that he did not <em>intend</em> the permission
to be used. It is submitted that the authorities cited in that
case do not support this doctrine. Two of them are cases where the
invitation was to come upon the land for a purpose in which the owner
had an interest, and in the three others a licensee was injured by
negligence in something done after the license was given....</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lathrop, J.</span> The declaration in this case, so far as material to the
questions presented at the argument, alleged that the defendants on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>the day of the accident were, and had been for a long time, lessees and
occupants of an estate on Atlantic Avenue in Boston; that the defendants
maintained a way or street down by their premises, “leading
out of said Atlantic Avenue, and extending to other premises beyond;
that said street was in all particulars like the public streets of the city
of Boston, being paved with granite blocks, and having sidewalks, and
to all appearances was a public thoroughfare; that the defendants had
placed no sign or notice of any kind upon or about said street&#160;...
which would give warning to the plaintiff or to the public that said
street was private property, or dangerous, but had erected a granite
curbing out into said street, extending one half the distance across the
same, on a line with the rear of their estate, said granite curbing being
from six to seven inches above the grade of the paving; that said obstruction
was dangerous both by day and by night to all persons who
entered upon or passed through said street; that on or about said day
the plaintiff had business that called him to the premises that lie beyond
the estate of the defendants on said street, and, supposing and
assuming that said street was a highway, and being induced by the
acts and omissions of these defendants to so suppose and assume,
entered in and upon said street to drive through the same; that said
obstruction was covered by snow at said time, and plaintiff was unable
to see the same; and, while in the exercise of due care, his sleigh
struck said granite curbing,” and he was thrown out and injured.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opening of the plaintiff’s counsel added but little to the declaration.
It stated that “the snow lay perfectly level” where the curbstone
was; that the plaintiff was driving through the defendants’ way
“into the way lying beyond, of which it was&#160;... an extension,” to
reach the works of the company for which he was working. It also
stated that, before the defendants controlled the way under the written
lease, they owned the premises, erected the building, paved the
way, and put in the curbstone; “that ever since this building and
other buildings had been erected down there the public made use of
that way, as they would use any other street in the city; that is, as
much as they had any occasion to pass down there with teams or on
foot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It does not appear that the plaintiff had any right in the way, unless
he had it as one of the public. There is no allegation or statement
that the plaintiff had ever used the way before, or that he knew
the way was paved, or noticed whether there was a sign or not. Indeed,
if he was then using the way for the first time, the fair inference
would be, from the statement of the condition of the snow, that
the fact that the way was paved was unknown to him until after the
accident, and did not operate as an inducement to enter the way. The
declaration contained no allegation as to any use by the public of the
way, and the statement in the opening of counsel, that the public made
use of that way, was qualified by the words, “that is, as much as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>had any occasion to pass down there with teams or on foot.” It is
difficult to see how vehicles of any description could, when the paving
was sufficiently visible to act as an inducement, go over that portion
of the way which the defendants controlled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without laying stress upon these points, we are of opinion that the
declaration and the opening of the plaintiff’s counsel do not show that
there was any breach on the part of the defendants of any duty which
they owed the plaintiff. The defendants were not obliged to put up a
sign notifying travellers on the public street that the passageway was
not a public way. Galligan <em>v.</em> Metacomet Manuf. Co., 143 Mass. 527;
Reardon <em>v.</em> Thompson, 149 Mass. 267; Redigan <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Maine
Railroad, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, 44.<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c015'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Nor can the fact that the passageway was paved be considered an
invitation or inducement to the public to enter upon it for their own
convenience. The defendants have a right to pave it for their own
use or for the use of their customers. Johnson <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Maine
Railroad, 125 Mass. 75; Heinlein <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Providence Railroad,
147 Mass. 136; Reardon <em>v.</em> Thompson, 149 Mass. 267; Donnelly <em>v.</em>
Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, 151 Mass. 210; Redigan <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Maine
Railroad, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, 44.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was in this case no allegation and no statement that the defendants
had any knowledge that the public was using the passageway,
or of such a condition of things that it can be said that they must
have known of it. But if it be assumed that there was such use and
such acquiescence that a license might be implied, the plaintiff stands
in no better position. “The general rule is,” as stated by Mr. Justice
Holmes in Reardon <em>v.</em> Thompson, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra</span></i>, “that a licensee goes
upon land at his own risk, and must take the premises as he finds
them.” See also Redigan <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, 44;
Gautret <em>v.</em> Egerton, L. R. 2 C. P. 371, 374.</p>

<p class='c007'>The licensor has, however, no right to create a new danger while
the license continues. Oliver <em>v.</em> Worcester, 102 Mass. 489, 502; Corrigan
<em>v.</em> Union Sugar Refinery, 98 Mass. 577; Corby <em>v.</em> Hill, 4 C. B.
(<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 556. So a railroad company which allows the public habitually
to use a private crossing of its tracks cannot use active force
against a person or vehicle crossing under a license, express or implied.
Sweeny <em>v.</em> Old Colony &amp; Newport Railroad, 10 Allen, 368;
Murphy <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, 133 Mass. 121; Hanks <em>v.</em> Boston
&amp; Albany Railroad, 147 Mass. 495. See June <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Albany
Railroad, 153 Mass. 79, 82.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have no occasion to consider whether the case of Holmes <em>v.</em>
Drew, 151 Mass. 578, is open to the criticism that it is inconsistent
with the doctrine that a person who dedicates a footway to the public
use is not obliged to keep it in repair (see Fisher <em>v.</em> Prowse, 2 B. &amp; S.
770, 780, and Robbins <em>v.</em> Jones, 15 C. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 221) as we are of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>opinion that that case has no application to the case at bar. In Holmes
<em>v.</em> Drew, the defendant made a continuous pavement in front of his
house, partly on his own land and partly on the public land; and it
was held that the jury might infer from this an invitation to walk
over the whole pavement. In the case at bar, the defendants merely
opened a private way into a public street, and we fail to see that they
thereby invited the public to use it, even though it were paved.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>TUTTLE <em>v.</em> GILBERT MANUFACTURING CO.<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, October 20, 1887.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 145 Massachusetts Reports, 169.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Tort, by lessee of a building against lessor. The lessee claimed,
and introduced evidence to show, that, at the time of letting, the lessor
agreed to repair the building and put it in safe condition; that the
lessee suffered damage by reason of a defect in the building; and that
the lessor failed and neglected to make repairs until after the damage
to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the evidence, the judge ruled that plaintiff could not recover,
and ordered a verdict for defendant. Plaintiff excepted.<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c015'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Morton, C. J.</span> It is the general rule that there is no warranty implied
in the letting of premises that they are reasonably fit for use.
The lessee takes an estate in the premises hired, and he takes the risk
of the quality of the premises, in the absence of an express or implied
warranty by the lessor, or of deceit. A lessee, therefore, if he is injured
by reason of the unsafe condition of the premises hired, cannot maintain
an action against the lessor, in the absence of warranty or of misrepresentation.
In cases where lessors have been held liable for such
injuries to the lessees, the liability is founded in negligence. Looney <em>v.</em>
McLean, 129 Mass. 33. Bowe <em>v.</em> Hunking, 135 Mass. 380, and cases
cited.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>The plaintiff admits the general rule, but contends that this case is
taken out of it because, at the time of the letting, the defendant agreed
to repair and put in a safe condition the stable floor, the unsafe condition
of which caused the injury. The contract relied on is a loose
one; it fixed no time within which the repairs were to be made, and
it is doubtful whether the evidence proved any breach of contract on
the part of the defendant. But if we assume that the contract was to
make the repairs within a reasonable time, and that the jury would
be justified in finding that the defendant had not performed it within
a reasonable time, the question is whether, for such a breach, the plaintiff
can maintain an action of tort to recover for personal injuries
sustained by reason of the defective condition of the stable floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cases are numerous and confusing as to the dividing line between
actions of contract and of tort, and there are many cases where
a man may have his election to bring either action. Where the cause
of action arises merely from a breach of promise, the action is in
contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>The action of tort has for its foundation the negligence of the defendant,
and this means more than a mere breach of a promise. Otherwise,
the failure to meet a note, or any other promise to pay money,
would sustain an action in tort for negligence, and thus the promisor
be made liable for all the consequential damages arising from such
failure.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a general rule, there must be some active negligence or misfeasance
to support tort. There must be some breach of duty distinct
from breach of contract. In the case at bar, the utmost shown against
the defendant is that there was unreasonable delay on its part in performing
an executory contract. As we have seen, it is not liable by
reason of the relation of lessor and lessee, but its liability, if any,
must rest solely upon a breach of this contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>We do not see how the cases would differ in principle if an action
were brought against a third person who had contracted to repair the
stable floor and had unreasonably delayed in performing his contract.
We are not aware of any authority for maintaining such an action. If
the defendant had performed the work contemplated by its contract
unskilfully and negligently, it would be liable to an action of tort,
because in such case there would be a misfeasance, which is a sufficient
foundation for an action of tort. Such was the case of Gill <em>v.</em>
Middleton, 105 Mass. 477.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case of Ashley <em>v.</em> Root, 4 Allen, 504, does not conflict with our
view, but recognizes the rule that to sustain an action of tort there
must be more than a mere breach of contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff now argues that he had the right to go to the jury
upon the questions of warranty and deceit. It does not appear that
this claim was made in the Superior Court; but it is clear that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>is no sufficient evidence of any warranty that the stable was safe, or of
any deceit or misrepresentation on the part of the defendant or its
agent.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>SOUTHCOTE <em>v.</em> STANLEY<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Exchequer, June 4, 1856.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 1 Hurlstone &amp; Norman, 247.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>The declaration stated that at the time of the committing of the
grievances, &amp;c., the defendant was possessed of an hotel, into which he
had then permitted and invited the plaintiff to come as a visitor of the
defendant, and in which the plaintiff as such visitor then lawfully was
by the permission and invitation of the defendant, and in which hotel
there then was a glass door of the defendant which it was then necessary
for the plaintiff, as such visitor, to open for the purpose of leaving
the hotel, and which the plaintiff, as such visitor, then by the permission
of the defendant and with his knowledge, and without any
warning from him, lawfully opened for the purpose aforesaid, as a door
which was in a proper condition to be opened; nevertheless, by and
through the mere carelessness, negligence, and default of the defendant
in that behalf, the said door was then in an insecure and dangerous
condition, and unfit to be used or opened, and by reason of the said
door being in such insecure and dangerous condition and unfit, as
aforesaid, and of the then carelessness, negligence, default, and improper
conduct of the defendant in that behalf, a large piece of glass
from the said door fell out of the same to and upon the plaintiff, and
wounded him, and he sustained divers bodily injuries, and remained
ill and unable to work for a long time, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Demurrer and joinder therein.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Raymond</em>, in support of the demurrer. The declaration discloses
no cause of action. It is not stated that the plaintiff was in the hotel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>as a guest, but merely as a visitor; and there is no allegation that the
defendant knew of the dangerous condition of the door. To render
the defendant liable, the declaration ought to have shown some contract
between the plaintiff and the defendant which imposed on the
latter the obligation of taking care that the door was secure; or it
should have alleged some negligence on the part of the defendant in
the performance of a duty which he owed to the plaintiff. [<span class='sc'>Bramwell,
B.</span> If a person invites another into his house, and the latter
can only enter through a particular door, is it not the duty of the
former to take care that the door is in a secure condition?] He may
not be aware that the door is insecure. This declaration only alleges
that through the carelessness, negligence, and default of the defendant
the door was in a dangerous condition; that cannot be read as involving
the allegation that the defendant knew that the door was insecure.
All facts necessary to raise a legal liability must be strictly averred.
Metcalfe <em>v.</em> Hetherington, 11 Exch. 257. [<span class='sc'>Alderson, B.</span> It is not
stated that it was the duty of the defendant, as an hotel keeper, to
take care that the door was secure. Suppose a person invites another
to his house, and the latter runs his hand through a pane of glass, how
is the former liable?] The Court then called on</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Gray, contra.</em> The declaration shows a duty on the part of the defendant,
and a breach of that duty. It is immaterial whether the injury
takes place in a private house, or in a shop, or in a street; the
only question is whether the person who complains was lawfully
there? The case is similar in principle to that of Randleson <em>v.</em> Murray,
8 A. &amp; E. 109, which decided that a warehouseman who lowers
goods from his warehouse is bound to use proper tackle for that purpose.
[<span class='sc'>Alderson, B.</span> It is the duty of every person who hangs anything
over a public way to take care that it is suspended by a proper
rope.] Whether it be a private house or a shop, a duty is so far imposed
on the occupier to keep it reasonably secure, that if a person
lawfully enters, and through the negligence of the occupier in leaving
it in an insecure state receives an injury, the occupier is responsible.
Here it is alleged that the defendant invited the plaintiff to come into
the hotel as a visitor; that shows that he was lawfully there. [<span class='sc'>Pollock,
C. B.</span> The position that an action lies because the plaintiff was
lawfully in the house, cannot be supported; a servant is lawfully in his
master’s house and yet if the balusters fell, whereby he was injured,
he could not maintain an action against the master. If a lady who is
invited to dinner goes in an expensive dress, and a servant spills something
over her dress which spoils it, the master of the house would not
be liable. Where a person enters a house by invitation the same rule
prevails as in the case of a servant. A visitor would have no right of
action for being put in a damp bed, or near a broken pane of glass,
whereby he caught cold. <span class='sc'>Alderson, B.</span> The case of a shop is different,
because a shop is open to the public; and there is a distinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>between persons who come on business and those who come by
invitation.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pollock, C. B.</span> We are all of opinion that the declaration cannot
be supported, and that the defendant is entitled to judgment. I do
not think it necessary to point out the reasons by which I have come to
that conclusion; because it follows from the decision of this Court
(Priestley <em>v.</em> Fowler, 3 M. &amp; W. 1) that the mere relation of master
and servant does not create any implied duty on the part of the master
to take more care of the servant than he may reasonably be expected
to do of himself. That decision has been followed by several cases,<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c015'><sup>[167]</sup></a>
and is now established law, though I believe the principle was not
recognized until recent times. The reason for the rule is that the
servant undertakes to run all the ordinary risks of service, including
those arising from the negligence of his fellow-servants. The rule applies
to all the members of a domestic establishment, so that the master
is not in general liable to a servant for injury resulting from the
negligence of a fellow-servant; neither can one servant maintain an
action against another for negligence whilst engaged in their common
employment. The same principle applies to the case of a visitor at a
house; whilst he remains there he is in the same position as any other
member of the establishment, so far as regards the negligence of the
master or his servants, and he must take his chance with the rest.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Alderson, B.</span> I am of the same opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bramwell, B.</span> I agree with Mr. <em>Gray</em> to this extent, that where a
person is in the house of another, either on business or for any other
purpose, he has a right to expect that the owner of the house will take
reasonable care to protect him from injury; for instance, that he will
not allow a trap-door to be open through which the visitor may fall.
But in this case my difficulty is to see that the declaration charges any
act of commission. If a person asked another to walk in his garden,
in which he had placed spring-guns or men-traps, and the latter, not
being aware of it, was thereby injured, that would be an act of commission.
But if a person asked a visitor to sleep at his house, and the
former omitted to see that the sheets were properly aired, whereby
the visitor caught cold, he could maintain no action, for there was no
act of commission, but simply an act of omission. This declaration
merely alleges that “by and through the mere carelessness, negligence,
default, and improper conduct of the defendant,” the glass fell from
the door. That means a want of care,—a default in not doing something.
The words are all negatives, and under these circumstances
the action is not maintainable. I doubted whether the words “carelessness,
negligence, and improper conduct,” &amp;c., might not mean
something equivalent to actual commission, but on the best consideration
which I can give the subject, it appears to me that they do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>mean that, but merely point to a negative. If I misconstrue the
declaration it is the fault of those who so framed it.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>BEEHLER <em>v.</em> DANIELS<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Rhode Island, May 1, 1894.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 18 Rhode Island Reports, 563.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Trespass on the Case. Certified from the Common Pleas Division
on demurrer to the declaration.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Stiness, J.</span> The plaintiff seeks to recover for injury caused by falling
into an elevator well in the defendants’ building, which he entered
in the discharge of his duty, as a member of the fire department of the
city of Providence, in answering a call to extinguish a fire. The negligence
alleged in the first count is a failure to guard and protect the
well; and in the second count such a packing of merchandise as to
guide and conduct one to the unguarded and unprotected well. The
defendants demur to the declaration, alleging as grounds of demurrer
that they owed no duty to the plaintiff; that he entered their premises
in the discharge of a public duty and assumed the risks of his employment;
that he was in the premises without invitation from them; and
that they are not liable for consequences which they could not and
were not bound to foresee.</p>

<p class='c007'>The decisive question thus raised is, Did the defendants, under the
circumstances, owe to the plaintiff a duty, for failure in which they
are liable to him in damages? The question is not a new one, and
we think it is safe to say that it has never been answered otherwise
than in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff argues that it was his
duty to enter the premises, and, consequently, since an owner may
reasonably anticipate the liability of a fire, a duty arises from the
owner to the fireman to keep his premises guarded and safe. An extension
of this argument to its legitimate result, as a rule of law, is
sufficiently startling to show its unsoundness. The liability to fire is
common to all buildings and at all times. Hence every owner of
every building must at all times keep every part of his property,
in such condition, that a fireman, unacquainted with the place, and
groping about in darkness and smoke, shall come upon no obstacle,
opening, machine or anything whatever which may cause him injury.
This argument was urged in Woodruff <em>v.</em> Bowen, 136 Ind. 431; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>the court said: “We are of the opinion that the owner of a building
in a populous city does not owe it as a duty at common law, independent
of any statute or ordinance, to keep such building safe for
firemen or other officers, who, in a contingency, may enter the same
under a license conferred by law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Undoubtedly the plaintiff in this case had the right to enter the
defendants’ premises, and the character of his entry was that of a
licensee. Cooley on Torts, *313. But no such duty as is averred in
this declaration is due from an owner to a licensee. This question is
discussed in the case just cited, as also in many others. For example,
in Reardon <em>v.</em> Thompson, 149 Mass. 267, Holmes, J., says: “But the
general rule is that a licensee goes upon land at his own risk, and
must take the premises as he finds them. An open hole, which is not
concealed otherwise than by the darkness of the night, is a danger
which a licensee must avoid at his peril.” So in Mathews <em>v.</em> Bensel,
51 N. J. Law, 30, Beasley, C. J., says: “The substantial ground of
complaint laid in the count is, that the defendants did not properly
construct their planer, and, being a dangerous instrument, did not surround
it with proper safeguards. But there is no legal principle that
imposes such a duty as this on the owner of property with respect to
a mere licensee. This is the recognized rule. In the case of Holmes
<em>v.</em> Northeastern Railway Co., L. R. 4 Exch. 254, 256, Baron Channell
says: ‘That where a person is a mere licensee he has no cause of
action on account of the dangers existing in the place he is permitted
to enter.’” In Parker <em>v.</em> Portland Publishing Co., 69 Me. 173, this
question is fully examined, the court holding it to be well settled, if
the plaintiff was at the place where the injury was received by license
merely, that the defendant would owe him no duty and that he could
not recover. See also Indiana, etc., Railway Co. <em>v.</em> Barnhart, 115
Ind. 399; Gibson <em>v.</em> Leonard, 37 Ill. App. 344; Bedell <em>v.</em> Berkey, 76
Mich. 435.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a clear distinction between a license and an invitation to
enter premises, and an equally clear distinction as to the duty of an
owner in the two cases. An owner owes to a licensee no duty as to
the condition of premises, unless imposed by statute, save that he
should not knowingly let him run upon a hidden peril or wilfully
cause him harm; while to one invited he is under obligation for reasonable
security for the purposes of the invitation. The plaintiff’s
declaration does not set out a cause of action upon either of these
grounds, and the cases cited and relied on by him fall within the two
classes of cases described, and mark the line of duty very clearly.
Parker <em>v.</em> Barnard, 135 Mass. 116, was the case of a police officer who
had entered a building, the doors of which were found open in the
night time, to inspect it according to the rules of the police department,
and fell down an unguarded elevator well. A statute required
such wells to be protected by railings and trap-doors. Judgment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>having been given for the defendant at the trial, a new trial was
ordered upon the ground of a violation of statute. The court says:
“The owner or occupant of land or a building is not liable, at common
law, for obstructions, pitfalls, or other dangers there existing, as, in
the absence of any inducement or invitation to others to enter, he
may use his property as he pleases. But he holds his property ‘subject
to such reasonable control and regulation of the mode of keeping
and use as the legislature, under the police power vested in them by
the Constitution of the Commonwealth, may think necessary for the
preventing of injuries to the rights of others and the security of the
public health and welfare.’” Then, likening the plaintiff to a fireman,
the court also says: “Even if they must encounter the danger arising
from neglect of such precautions against obstructions and pitfalls as
those invited or induced to enter have a right to expect, they may demand,
as against the owners or occupants, that they observe the
statute in the construction and management of their building.” In
Learoyd <em>v.</em> Godfrey, 138 Mass. 315, a police officer fell down an uncovered
well in or near a passageway to a house where he was called to
quell a disturbance of the peace. A verdict for the plaintiff was sustained
upon the ground that the jury must have found that the officer
was using the passageway by the defendant’s invitation and that the
evidence warranted the finding. Gordon <em>v.</em> Cummings, 152 Mass.
513, was the case of a letter carrier who fell into an elevator well, in a
hallway where he was accustomed to leave letters in boxes put there
for that purpose. The court held that there was an implied invitation
to the carrier to enter the premises. In Engel <em>v.</em> Smith, 82 Mich. 1,
the plaintiff fell through a trap-door left open in a building where he
was employed. The question of duty is not discussed in the case but
simply the fact of negligence. In Bennett <em>v.</em> Railroad Co., 102 U. S.
577, the plaintiff, a passenger, fell through a hatch hole in the depot
floor. The court construed the declaration as setting out facts which
amounted to an invitation to the plaintiff to pass over the route which
he took through the shed depot where the hatch hole was.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present case the plaintiff sets out no violation of a statute, or
facts which amount to an invitation, and, consequently, under the
well-settled rule of law, the defendants were under no liability to him
for the condition of their premises or the packing of their merchandise.
The demurrer to the declaration must therefore be sustained.<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c015'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'>WINTERBOTTOM <em>v.</em> WRIGHT<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Exchequer, June 6, 1842.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 10 Meeson &amp; Welsby, 109.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Case. The declaration stated, that the defendant was a contractor
for the supply of mail-coaches, and had in that character contracted
for hire and reward with the Postmaster-General, to provide the mail-coach
for the purpose of conveying the mail-bags from Hartford, in
the county of Chester, to Holyhead: That the defendant, under and
by virtue of the said contract, had agreed with the said Postmaster-General
that the said mail-coach should, during the said contract, be
kept in a fit, proper, safe, and secure state and condition for the said
purpose, and took upon himself, to wit, under and by virtue of the
said contract, the sole and exclusive duty, charge, care, and burden
of the repairs, state, and condition of the said mail-coach; and it
had become and was the sole and exclusive duty of the defendant, to
wit, under and by virtue of his said contract, to keep and maintain
the said mail-coach in a fit, proper, safe, and secure state and condition
for the purpose aforesaid: That Nathaniel Atkinson and other
persons, having notice of the said contract, were under contract with
the Postmaster-General to convey the said mail-coach from Hartford
to Holyhead, and to supply horses and coachmen for that purpose,
and also not, on any pretence whatever, to use or employ any other
coach or carriage whatever than such as should be so provided, directed,
and appointed by the Postmaster-General: That the plaintiff,
being a mail-coachman, and thereby obtaining his livelihood, and
whilst the said several contracts were in force, having notice thereof,
and trusting to and confiding in the contract made between the defendant
and the Postmaster-General, and believing that the said coach
was in a fit, safe, secure, and proper state and condition for the purpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>aforesaid, and not knowing and having no means of knowing to
the contrary thereof, hired himself to the said Nathaniel Atkinson
and his co-contractors as mail-coachman, to drive and take the conduct
of the said mail-coach, which but for the said contract of the
defendant he would not have done. The declaration then averred,
that the defendant so improperly and negligently conducted himself,
and so utterly disregarded his aforesaid contract, and so wholly
neglected and failed to perform his duty in this behalf, that heretofore,
to wit, on the 8th of August, 1840, whilst the plaintiff, as such mail-coachman
so hired, was driving the said mail-coach from Hartford to
Holyhead, the same coach, being a mail-coach found and provided by
the defendant under his said contract, and the defendant then acting
under his said contract, and having the means of knowing and then
well knowing all the aforesaid premises, the said mail-coach being
then in a frail, weak, infirm, and dangerous state and condition, to wit,
by and through certain latent defects in the state and condition
thereof, and unsafe and unfit for the use and purpose aforesaid, and
from no other cause, circumstance, matter, or thing whatsoever gave
way and broke down, whereby the plaintiff was thrown from his seat,
and, in consequence of injuries then received, had become lamed for
life.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this declaration the defendant pleaded several pleas, to two of
which there were demurrers; but, as the Court gave no opinion as to
their validity, it is not necessary to state them.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Peacock</em>, who appeared in support of the demurrers, having argued
against the sufficiency of the pleas,—</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Byles</em>, for the defendant, objected that the declaration was bad in
substance. This is an action brought, not against Atkinson and his
co-contractors, who were the employers of the plaintiff, but against
the person employed by the Postmaster-General, and totally unconnected
with them or with the plaintiff. Now it is a general rule, that
wherever a wrong arises merely out of the breach of a contract, which
is the case on the face of this declaration, whether the form in which
the action is conceived be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex contractu</span></i> or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex delicto</span></i>, the party who
made the contract alone can sue: Tollit <em>v.</em> Sherstone, 5 M. &amp; W. 283.
If the rule were otherwise, and privity of contract were not requisite,
there would be no limit to such actions. If the plaintiff may, as in
this case, run through the length of three contracts, he may run
through any number or series of them; and the most alarming consequences
would follow the adoption of such a principle. Levy <em>v.</em>
Langridge, 4 M. &amp; W. 337, will probably be referred to on the other
side. But that case was expressly decided on the ground that the defendant,
who sold the gun by which the plaintiff was injured, although
he did not personally contract with the plaintiff, who was a minor,
knew that it was bought to be used by him. Here there is no allegation
that the defendant knew that the coach was to be driven by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>plaintiff. There, moreover, fraud was alleged in the declaration, and
found by the jury: and there, too, the cause of injury was a weapon
of a dangerous nature, and the defendant was alleged to have had
notice of the defect in its construction. Nothing of that sort appears
upon this declaration.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Peacock, contra.</em> This case is within the principle of the decision
in Levy <em>v.</em> Langridge. Here the defendant entered into a contract
with a public officer to supply an article which, if imperfectly constructed,
was necessarily dangerous, and which, from its nature and
the use for which it was destined, was necessarily to be driven by a
coachman. That is sufficient to bring the case within the rule established
by Levy <em>v.</em> Langridge. In that case the contract made by the
father of the plaintiff with the defendant was made on behalf of himself
and his family generally, and there was nothing to show that the
defendant was aware even of the existence of the particular son who
was injured. Suppose a party made a contract with government for
a supply of muskets, one of which, from its misconstruction, burst
and injured a soldier: there it is clear that the use of the weapon by a
soldier would have been contemplated, although not by the particular
individual who received the injury, and could it be said, since the
decision in Levy <em>v.</em> Langridge, that he could not maintain an action
against the contractor? So, if a coachmaker, employed to put on the
wheels of a carriage, did it so negligently that one of them flew off, and
a child of the owner were thereby injured, the damage being the
natural and immediate consequence of his negligence, he would surely
be responsible. So, if a party entered into a contract to repair a
church, a workhouse, or other public building, and did it so insufficiently
that a person attending the former, or a pauper in the latter,
were injured by the falling of a stone, he could not maintain an action
against any other person than the contractor; but against him he
must surely have a remedy. It is like the case of a contractor who
negligently leaves open a sewer, whereby a person passing along the
street is injured. It is clear that no action could be maintained against
the Postmaster-General: Hall <em>v.</em> Smith, 2 Bing. 156; Humphreys <em>v.</em>
Mears, 1 Man. &amp; R. 187; Priestly <em>v.</em> Fowler. But here the declaration
alleges the accident to have happened through the defendant’s
negligence and want of care. The plaintiff had no opportunity of
seeing that the carriage was sound and secure. [<span class='sc'>Alderson, B.</span> The
decision in Levy <em>v.</em> Langridge proceeds upon the ground of the knowledge
and fraud of the defendant.] Here also there was fraud:
the defendant represented the coach to be in a proper state for use,
and whether he represented that which was false within his knowledge,
or a fact as true which he did not know to be so, it was equally a fraud
in point of law, for which he is responsible.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Abinger, C. B.</span> I am clearly of opinion that the defendant is
entitled to our judgment. We ought not to permit a doubt to rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>upon this subject, for our doing so might be the means of letting in
upon us an infinity of actions. This is an action of the first impression,
and it has been brought in spite of the precautions which were
taken, in the judgment of this Court in the case of Levy <em>v.</em> Langridge,
to obviate any notion that such an action could be maintained.
We ought not to attempt to extend the principle of that decision,
which, although it has been cited in support of this action, wholly
fails as an authority in its favor; for there the gun was bought for
the use of the son, the plaintiff in that action, who could not make
the bargain himself, but was really and substantially the party contracting.
Here the action is brought simply because the defendant
was a contractor with a third person; and it is contended that thereupon
he became liable to everybody who might use the carriage. If
there had been any ground for such an action, there certainly would
have been some precedent of it; but with the exception of actions
against innkeepers, and some few other persons, no case of a similar
nature has occurred in practice. That is a strong circumstance, and
is of itself a great authority against its maintenance. It is however
contended, that this contract being made on the behalf of the public
by the Postmaster-General, no action could be maintained against
him, and therefore the plaintiff must have a remedy against the
defendant. But that is by no means a necessary consequence,—he
may be remediless altogether. There is no privity of contract between
these parties; and if the plaintiff can sue, every passenger, or even
any person passing along the road, who was injured by the upsetting
of the coach, might bring a similar action. Unless we confine the
operation of such contracts as this to the parties who entered into
them, the most absurd and outrageous consequences, to which I can
see no limit, would ensue. Where a party becomes responsible to
the public, by undertaking a public duty, he is liable, though the injury
may have arisen from the negligence of his servant or agent.
So, in cases of public nuisances, whether the act was done by the
party as a servant, or in any other capacity, you are liable to an action
at the suit of any person who suffers. Those, however, are cases where
the real ground of the liability is the public duty, or the commission
of the public nuisance. There is also a class of cases in which the
law permits a contract to be turned into a tort; but unless there has
been some public duty undertaken, or public nuisance committed,
they are all cases in which an action might have been maintained upon
the contract. Thus, a carrier may be sued either in assumpsit or
case; but there is no instance in which a party, who was not privy
to the contract entered into with him, can maintain any such action.
The plaintiff in this case could not have brought an action on the
contract; if he could have done so, what would have been his situation
supposing the Postmaster-General had released the defendant? That
would, at all events, have defeated his claim altogether. By permitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>this action, we should be working this injustice, that after the
defendant had done everything to the satisfaction of his employer,
and after all matters between them had been adjusted, and all accounts
settled on the footing of their contract, we should subject
them to be ripped open by this action of tort being brought against
him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Alderson, B.</span> I am of the same opinion. The contract in this
case was made with the Postmaster-General alone; and the case is
just the same as if he had come to the defendant and ordered a carriage,
and handed it at once over to Atkinson. If we were to hold that
the plaintiff could sue in such a case, there is no point at which such
actions would stop. The only safe rule is to confine the right to
recover to those who enter into the contract: if we go one step beyond
that, there is no reason why we should not go fifty. The only real
argument in favor of the action is, that this is a case of hardship;
but that might have been obviated, if the plaintiff had made himself a
party to the contract. Then it is urged that it falls within the principle
of the case of Levy <em>v.</em> Langridge. But the principle of that
case was simply this, that the father having bought the gun for the
very purpose of being used by the plaintiff, the defendant made representations
by which he was induced to use it. There, a distinct
fraud was committed on the plaintiff; the falsehood of the representation
was also alleged to have been within the knowledge of the
defendant who made it, and he was properly held liable for the consequences.
How are the facts of that case applicable to those of the
present? Where is the allegation of misrepresentation or fraud in this
declaration? It shows nothing of the kind. Our judgment must
therefore be for the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Gurney, B.</span>, concurred.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Rolfe, B.</span> The breach of the defendant’s duty, stated in this
declaration, is his omission to keep the carriage in a safe condition;
and when we examine the mode in which that duty is alleged to have
arisen, we find a statement that the defendant took upon himself, to
wit, under and by virtue of the said contract, the sole and exclusive
duty, charge, care, and burden of the repairs, state, and condition of
the said mail-coach, and, during all the time aforesaid, it had become
and was the sole and exclusive duty of the defendant, to wit, under
and by virtue of his said contract, to keep and maintain the said mail-coach
in a fit, proper, safe, and secure state and condition. The duty,
therefore, is shown to have arisen solely from the contract; and the
fallacy consists in the use of that word “duty.” If a duty to the
Postmaster-General be meant, that is true; but if a duty to the plaintiff
be intended (and in that sense the word is evidently used), there
was none. This is one of those unfortunate cases in which there
certainly has been <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum</span></i>, but it is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum absque injuria</span></i>; it is,
no doubt, a hardship upon the plaintiff to be without a remedy, but, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>that consideration we ought not to be influenced. Hard cases, it has
been frequently observed, are apt to introduce bad law.</p>

<p class='c014'>Action by Cooper against Blood Balm Company in the City Court
of Atlanta. Verdict for plaintiff. Defendants brought error.<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c015'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Blandford, J.</span> The main question in this case arises upon the
refusal of the Court below to award a nonsuit, and the solution of this
question depends upon whether, where one prepares what is known as
a proprietary or patent medicine, and puts it upon the market and
recommends it to the world as useful for the cure of certain diseases,
the bottle containing it having therewith a prescription made by the
proprietor of the medicine, in which he states that it is to be taken
in certain quantities, and such medicine, accompanied with this prescription,
is sold by the proprietor to a druggist for the purpose of
being resold to persons who might wish to use it, and the druggist sells
the same to a person who uses it in the quantity thus prescribed, and
it being shown that the same contains a certain article known as the
iodide of potash in such quantity as proves harmful to the person
thus using, the proprietor is liable. The plaintiff in error insists that
there is no liability on the part of the proprietor, (1) because it was
not sold by the proprietor to the person injured, but by a druggist
who had purchased the same from the proprietor; and several cases
are cited to sustain this position; (2) because the drug thus sold was
not imminently hurtful or poisonous.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. We are not aware of any decision of this Court upon this question,
indeed there is none; and we have searched carefully not only
the authorities cited by counsel in this case, but others, and we find
no question like the one which arises in this record determined by
any Court. In the case of Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester, 6 N. Y. (2 Seld.)
397, 57 Am. Dec. 455, 1 Thompson, Neg. 224, referred to by counsel
in this case, the question decided was, that a dealer in drugs and
medicines who carelessly labels a deadly poison as a harmless medicine,
and sends it so labelled into market, is liable to all persons who,
without fault on their part, are injured by using it as such medicine
in consequence of the false label. This comes nearer the present case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>than any we have been able to find, and it is relied upon by both
parties as an authority; and in the notes thereto by Mr. Freeman in
the American Decisions, the cases relied upon by counsel in this case
are embraced and referred to, and to some extent considered. It is
not denied by counsel in this case that the doctrine of the case cited
(Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester) is sound and correct law, but the present
case differs from that case, and mainly in this: there the drug sold
was a deadly poison, and the wrong consisted in putting a label upon
the same which indicated that it was a harmless medicine; whereas
in this case the medicine sold was not a deadly poison, and no label
was put upon it which was calculated to deceive any one in this respect.
But accompanying this medicine was a prescription of the
proprietor stating the quantity to be taken, and the evidence tended to
show that the quantity thus prescribed contained iodide of potash to
such an extent as, when taken by the plaintiff, produced the injury
and damage complained of. The liability of the plaintiff in error to
the person injured arises, not by contract, but for a wrong committed
by the proprietor in the prescription and direction as to the dose that
should be taken.</p>

<p class='c007'>We can see no difference whether the medicine was directly sold to
the defendant in error by the proprietor, or by an intermediate party
to whom the proprietors had sold it in the first instance for the purpose
of being sold again. It was put upon the market by the proprietor,
not alone for the use of druggists to whom they might sell
it, but to be used by the public in general who might need the same
for the cure of certain diseases for which the proprietor set forth in
his label the same was adapted. This was the same thing as if the
proprietor himself had sold this medicine to the defendant in error,
with his instructions and directions as to how the same should be
taken. In all the cases cited by the plaintiff in error there is no case
in which the proprietor prescribed the doses and quantities to be taken
of the medicine sold by him. If this medicine contained the iodide
of potassium in sufficient quantity to produce the injurious consequences
complained of to the defendant in error, and if the same was
administered to him, either by himself or any other person, as prescribed
in the label accompanying the medicine, he could, in our judgment,
recover for any injury he may have sustained on account of the
poisonous effect thereof. It was a wrong on the part of the proprietor
to extend to the public generally an invitation to take the medicine in
quantities sufficient to injure and damage persons who might take it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A medicine which is known to the public as being dangerous and
poisonous if taken in large quantities, may be sold by the proprietor to
druggists and others, and if any person, without more, should purchase
and take the same so as to cause injury to himself, the proprietor
would not be liable. But if the contents of a medicine are
concealed from the public generally, and the medicine is prepared by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>one who know its contents, and he sells the same, recommending it
for certain diseases and prescribing the mode in which it shall be
taken, and injury is thereby sustained by the person taking the same,
the proprietor would be liable for the damage thus sustained. These
proprietary or patent medicines are secret, or intended by the proprietors
to be secret, as to their contents. They expect to derive a
profit from such secrecy. They are therefore liable for all injuries
sustained by any one who takes their medicine in such quantities as
may be prescribed by them. There is no way for a person who uses
the medicine to ascertain what its contents are, ordinarily, and in this
case the contents were only ascertained after an analysis made by a
chemist,—which would be very inconvenient and expensive to the
public; nor would it be the duty of a person using the medicine to
ascertain what poisonous drugs it may contain. He has a right to
rely upon the statement and recommendation of the proprietor,
printed and published to the world; and if thus relying, he takes the
medicine and is injured on account of some concealed drug of which
he is unaware, the proprietor is not free from fault, and is liable for the
injury thereby sustained. It appears from the analysis made by
the chemist in this case that this medicine contained 25 grains of the
iodide of potash to two tablespoonfuls of the medicine. The testimony
of the plaintiff, by witnesses learned in the profession of medicine,
was that iodide of potash in this quantity would produce the
effects upon a person using it shown by the condition of the defendant
in error. The prescription accompanying the bottle directed the
taking of one to two tablespoonfuls of the medicine, and this was done
by the defendant in error, and he was thereby greatly injured and
damaged.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is not like the case of a dangerous machine or a gun sold to a
person and by him given or sold to another, as in some of the cases
referred to. Mr. Freeman, in his notes to the case above referred to
(Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester), alludes to all those cases; and Mr. Thompson,
in his work on Negligence, refers to the same cases, and they are
there fully discussed.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Sanborn</span>, Circuit Judge:<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c015'><sup>[172]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Is a manufacturer or vendor of an article or machine which he
knows, when he sells it, to be imminently dangerous, by reason of a
concealed defect therein, to the life and limbs of any one who shall use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>it for the purpose for which it was made and intended, liable to a
stranger to the contract of sale for an injury which he sustains from
the concealed defect while he is lawfully applying the article or
machine to its intended use?</p>

<p class='c007'>The argument of this question has traversed the whole field in which
the liability of contractors, manufacturers, and vendors to strangers
to their contracts for negligence in the construction or sale of their
articles has been contested. The decisions which have been cited are
not entirely harmonious, and it is impossible to reconcile all of them
with any established rule of law. And yet the underlying principle
of the law of negligence, that it is the duty of every one to so act himself
and to so use his property as to do no unnecessary damage to his
neighbors, leads us fairly through the maze. With this fundamental
principle in mind, if we contemplate the familiar rules that every one
is liable for the natural and probable effects of his acts; that negligence
is a breach of a duty; that an injury that is the natural and
probable consequence of an act of negligence is actionable, while one
that could not have been foreseen or reasonably anticipated as the
probable effect of such an act is not actionable, because the act of
negligence in such a case is the remote, and not the proximate, cause
of the injury; and that, for the same reason, an injury is not actionable
which would not have resulted from an act of negligence except
from the interposition of an independent cause (Chicago, St. Paul,
Minneapolis &amp; Omaha R. Co. <em>v.</em> Elliott, 55 Fed. 949, 5 C. C. A. 347,
20 L. R. A. 582)—nearly all the decisions upon this subject range
themselves along symmetrical lines, and establish rational rules of the
law of negligence consistent with the basic principles upon which it
rests.</p>

<p class='c007'>Actions for negligence are for breaches of duty. Actions on contracts
are for breaches of agreements. Hence the limits of liability
for negligence are not the limits of liability for breaches of contracts,
and actions for negligence often accrue where actions upon contracts
do not arise, and vice versa. It is a rational and fair deduction from
the rules to which brief reference has been made that one who makes
or sells a machine, a building, a tool, or an article of merchandise
designed and fitted for a specific use is liable to the person who, in
the natural course of events, uses it for the purpose for which it was
made or sold, for an injury which is the natural and probable consequence
of sale. But when a contractor builds a house or a bridge, or
a manufacturer constructs a car or a carriage, for the owner thereof
under a special contract with him, an injury to any other person than
the owner for whom the article is built and to whom it is delivered
cannot ordinarily be foreseen or reasonably anticipated as the probable
result of the negligence in its construction. So, when a manufacturer
sells articles to the wholesale or retail dealers, or to those who are to
use them, injury to third persons is not generally the natural or probable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>effect of negligence in their manufacture, because (1) such a
result cannot ordinarily be reasonably anticipated, and because (2)
an independent cause—the responsible human agency of the purchaser—without
which the injury to the third person would not
occur, intervenes, and, as Wharton says, “insulates” the negligence
of the manufacturer from the injury to the third person. Wharton
on Law of Negligence (2d ed.) § 134. For the reason that in the cases
of the character which have been mentioned the natural and probable
effect of the negligence of the contractor or manufacturer will generally
be limited to the party for whom the article is constructed, or
to whom it is sold, and, perhaps more than all this, for the reason that
a wise and conservative public policy has impressed the courts with
the view that there must be a fixed and definite limitation to the liability
of manufacturers and vendors for negligence in the construction
and sale of complicated machines and structures which are to be
operated or used by the intelligent and the ignorant, the skilful and
the incompetent, the watchful and the careless, parties that cannot
be known to the manufacturers or vendors, and who use the
articles all over the country hundreds of miles distant from the place
of their manufacture or original sale, a general rule has been adopted
and has become established by repeated decisions of the courts of
England and of this country that in these cases the liability of the
contractor or manufacturer for negligence in the construction or sale
of the articles which he makes or vends is limited to the persons to
whom he is liable under his contracts of construction or sale. The
limits of the liability for negligence and for breaches of contract in
cases of this character are held to be identical. The general rule is
that a contractor, manufacturer, or vendor is not liable to third parties
who have no contractual relations with him for negligence in the
construction, manufacture, or sale of the articles he handles. Winterbottom

<p class='c007'>In the leading case of Winterbottom <em>v.</em> Wright this rule is placed
upon the ground of public policy, upon the ground that there would
be no end of litigation if contractors and manufacturers were to be
held liable to third persons for every act of negligence in the construction
of the articles or machines they make after the parties to whom
they have sold them have received and accepted them. In that case
the defendant had made a contract with the Postmaster-General to
provide and keep in repair the stage-coach used to convey the mail
from Hartford to Holyhead. The coach broke down, overturned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>and injured the driver, who sued the contractor for the injury resulting
from his negligence. Lord Abinger, C. B., said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no privity of contract between these parties; and, if
the plaintiff can sue, every passenger, or even any person passing
along the road, who was injured by the upsetting of the coach, might
bring a similar action. Unless we confine the operation of such contracts
as this to the parties who entered into them, the most absurd
and outrageous consequences, to which I can see no limit, would
ensue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Baron Alderson said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am of the same opinion. The contract in this case was made
with the Postmaster-General alone; and the case is just the same as if
he had come to the defendant and ordered a carriage, and handed it at
once over to Atkinson. If we were to hold that the plaintiff could
sue in such a case, there is no point at which such actions would stop.
The only safe rule is to confine the right to recover to those who enter
into the contract. If we go one step beyond that, there is no reason
why we should not go fifty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The views expressed by the judges in this case have prevailed in
England and in the United States, with the exception of two decisions
which are in conflict with the leading case and with all the decisions
to which reference has been made. Those cases are Devlin <em>v.</em> Smith,
89 N. Y. 470, 42 Am. Rep. 311, in which Smith, a painter, employed
Stevenson, a contractor, to build a scaffold 90 feet in height, for the
express purpose of enabling the painter’s workmen to stand upon it
to paint the interior of the dome of a building, and the Court of
Appeals of New York held that Stevenson was liable to a workman of
Smith, the painter, who was injured by a fall, caused by the negligence
of Stevenson in the construction of the scaffold upon which
he was working; and Schubert <em>v.</em> J. R. Clark Co., 49 Minn. 331, 51
N. W. 1103, 15 L. R. A. 818, 32 Am. St. Rep. 559, in which a painter
purchased of a manufacturer a stepladder, and one of the painter’s
employees, who was injured by the breaking of a step caused by the
negligence of the manufacturer, was permitted to recover of the latter
for the injuries he had sustained. The decision in Devlin <em>v.</em> Smith
may, perhaps, be sustained on the ground that the workmen of Smith
were the real parties in interest in the contract, since Stevenson was
employed and expressly agreed to construct the scaffold for their use.
But the case of Schubert <em>v.</em> J. R. Clark Co. is in direct conflict with
the side saddle case, Bragdon <em>v.</em> Perkins-Campbell Co., 87 Fed. 109,
30 C. C. A. 567; the porch case, Curtain <em>v.</em> Somerset, 140 Pa. 70, 21
Atl. 244, 12 L. R. A. 322, 23 Am. St. Rep. 220; the defective cylinder
case, Heizer <em>v.</em> Kingsland &amp; Douglass Mfg. Co., 110 Mo. 617, 19 S. W.
630, 15 L. R. A. 821, 33 Am. St. Rep. 481; the defective hook case,
McCaffrey <em>v.</em> Mfg. Co., (R. I.) 50 Atl. 651, 55 L. R. A. 822; and with
the general rule upon which all these cases stand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>It is, perhaps, the more remarkable that the current of decisions
throughout all the courts of England and the United States should be
so uniform and conclusive in support of this rule, and that there
should, in the multitude of opinions, be but one or two in conflict
with it, than it is that such sporadic cases should be found. They are
insufficient in themselves, or in the reasoning they contain, to overthrow
or shake the established rule which prevails throughout the
English-speaking nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>But while this general rule is both established and settled, there
are, as is usually the case, exceptions to it as well defined and settled
as the rule itself. There are three exceptions to this rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first is that an act of negligence of a manufacturer or vendor
which is imminently dangerous to the life or health of mankind, and
which is committed in the preparation or sale of an article intended
to preserve, destroy, or affect human life, is actionable by third parties
who suffer from the negligence. Dixon <em>v.</em> Bell, 5 Maule &amp; Sel.
198; Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester, 6 N. Y. 397, 57 Am. Dec. 455; Norton
<em>v.</em> Sewall, 106 Mass. 143, 8 Am. Rep. 298; Elkins <em>v.</em> McKean, 79 Pa.
493, 502; Bishop <em>v.</em> Weber, 139 Mass. 411, 1 N. E. 154, 52 Am. Rep.
715; Peters <em>v.</em> Johnson, (W. Va.) 41 S. E. 190, 191, 57 L. R. A. 428.
The leading case upon this subject is Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester, 6 N. Y.
397, 57 Am. Dec. 455. A dealer in drugs sold to a druggist a jar of
belladonna, a deadly poison, and labelled it “Extract of Dandelion.”
The druggist filled a prescription of extract of dandelion, prepared by
a physician for his patient. The patient took the prescription thus
filled, and recovered of the wholesale dealer for the injuries she sustained.
In Norton <em>v.</em> Sewall, 106 Mass. 143, 8 Am. Rep. 298, a recovery
was had by a third party for the sale of laudanum as rhubarb;
in Bishop <em>v.</em> Weber, for the furnishing of poisonous food for wholesome
food; in Peters <em>v.</em> Johnson, for the sale of saltpetre for epsom salts;
and in Dixon <em>v.</em> Bell, for placing a loaded gun in the hands of a child.
In all these cases of sale the natural and probable result of the act of
negligence—nay, the inevitable result of it—was not an injury to
the party to whom the sales were made, but to those who, after the
purchasers had disposed of the articles, should consume them. Hence
these cases stand upon two well-established principles of law: (1)
That every one is bound to avoid acts or omissions imminently dangerous
to the lives of others, and (2) that an injury which is the
natural and probable result of an act of negligence is actionable. It
was the natural and probable result of the negligence in these cases
that the vendees would not suffer, but that those who subsequently
purchased the deleterious articles would sustain the injuries resulting
from the negligence of the manufacturers or dealers who furnished
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second exception is that an owner’s act of negligence which
causes injury to one who is invited by him to use his defective appliance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>upon the owner’s premises may form the basis of an action
against the owner. Coughtry <em>v.</em> Globe Woolen Co., 56 N. Y. 124,
15 Am. Rep. 387; Bright <em>v.</em> Barnett &amp; Record Co., (Wis.) 60 N. W.
418, 420, 26 L. R. A. 524; Heaven <em>v.</em> Pender, L. R. 11 Q. B. Div.
503; Roddy <em>v.</em> Railway Co., 104 Mo. 234, 241, 15 S. W. 1112, 12
L. R. A. 746, 24 Am. St. Rep. 333. In Coughtry <em>v.</em> Globe Woolen Co.,
56 N. Y. 124, 15 Am. Rep. 387, the owner of a building employed
Osborn &amp; Martin to construct a cornice, and agreed with them to
furnish a scaffold upon which their men could perform the work. He
furnished the scaffold and one of the employees of the contractors was
injured by the negligence of the owner in constructing the scaffold.
The court held that the act of the owner was an implied invitation to
the employees of Osborn &amp; Martin to use the scaffold and imposed
upon him a liability for negligence in its erection. The other cases
cited to this exception are of a similar character.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third exception to the rule is that one who sells or delivers an
article which he knows to be imminently dangerous to life or limb to
another without notice of its qualities is liable to any person who suffers
an injury therefrom which might have been reasonably anticipated,
whether there were any contractual relations between the parties or
not. Langridge <em>v.</em> Levy, 2 M. &amp; W. 519, 4 M. &amp; W. 337; Wellington
<em>v.</em> Oil Co., 104 Mass. 64, 67; Lewis <em>v.</em> Terry, (Cal.) 43 Pac. 398. In
Langridge <em>v.</em> Levy, 2 M. &amp; W. 519, a dealer sold a gun to the father
for the use of the son, and represented that it was a safe gun, and made
by one Nock. It was not made by Nock, was a defective gun, and
when the son discharged it, it exploded and injured him. The son was
permitted to recover, because the defendant had knowingly sold the
gun to the father for the purpose of being used by the plaintiff by
loading and discharging it, and had knowingly made a false warranty
that this might be safely done, and the plaintiff, on the faith of that
warranty, and believing it to be true, had used the gun, and sustained
the damages. The court said in conclusion:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We therefore think that, as there is fraud, and damage, the result
of that fraud, not from an act remote and consequential, but one contemplated
by the defendant at the time as one of its results, the party
guilty of the fraud is responsible to the party injured.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This case was affirmed in 4 M. &amp; W. 337, on the ground that the
sale of the gun to the father for the use of the son with the knowledge
that it was not as represented was a fraud, which entitled the son to
recover the damages he had sustained.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Wellington <em>v.</em> Oil Co., the defendants knowingly sold to one
Chase, a retail dealer, to be sold by him to his customers as oil,
naphtha, a dangerous and explosive liquid. Chase sold the naphtha
as oil, the plaintiff used it in a lamp for illuminating purposes, it
ignited and exploded, and he recovered of the wholesale dealer. Judge
Gray, later Mr. Justice Gray of the Supreme Court, said:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“It is well settled that a man who delivers an article, which he
knows to be dangerous or noxious, to another person, without notice of
its nature and qualities, is liable for an injury which may reasonably
be contemplated as likely to result, and which does in fact result therefrom
to that person or any other who is not himself in fault. Thus a
person who delivers a carboy, which he knows to contain nitric acid,
to a carrier, without informing him of the nature of its contents, is
liable for an injury occasioned by the leaking out of the acid upon
another carrier, to whom it is delivered by the first in the ordinary
course of business, to be carried to its destination. Farrant <em>v.</em> Barnes,
11 C. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 553. So a chemist who sells a bottle of liquid, made
up of ingredients known only to himself, representing it to be fit to be
used for washing the hair, and knowing that it is to be used by the
purchaser’s wife, is liable for an injury occasioned to her by using it
for washing her hair. George <em>v.</em> Skivington, Law Rep. 5 Ex. 1.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Lewis <em>v.</em> Terry, (Cal.) 43 Pac. 398, a dealer, knowing a folding
bed to be defective and unsafe, sold it to a Mr. Apperson without informing
him of the fact. His wife suffered a broken arm and other
severe injuries from the negligence of the dealer in the sale of the
bed, and recovered of him the damages she sustained.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Supreme Court of Missouri, in Heizer <em>v.</em> Kingsland &amp; Douglass
Mfg. Co., in which they held that the manufacturer was not liable
to a third person for negligence in the construction of the cylinder of
a threshing machine, which burst and injured him, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Had the defendant sold this machine to Ellis, knowing that the
cylinder was defective, and for that reason dangerous, without informing
him of the defect, then the defendant would be liable even to
third persons not themselves in fault. Shearman &amp; Redfield on
Negligence, (4th ed.) § 117.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Turning now to the case in hand, it is no longer difficult to dispose
of it. The allegations of the complaint are that the defendant prepared
a covering for the cylinder of the threshing machine, which
was customarily and necessarily used by those who operated it to walk
upon, and which was so incapable of sustaining the least weight that
it would bend and collapse whenever any one stepped upon it; that
it concealed this defective and dangerous condition of the threshing
rig so that it could not be readily discovered by persons engaged in
operating or working upon it; that it knew that the machine was in
this imminently dangerous condition when it shipped and supplied it
to the employer of the plaintiff; and that the plaintiff has sustained
serious injury through this defect in its construction. The case falls
fairly within the third exception. It portrays a negligence imminently
dangerous to the lives and limbs of those who should use the
machine, a machine imminently dangerous to the lives and limbs of
all who should undertake to operate it, a concealment of this dangerous
condition, a knowledge of the defendant when it was shipped and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>supplied to the employer of the plaintiff that the rig was imminently
dangerous to all who should use it for the purpose for which it was
made and sold, and consequent damage to the plaintiff. It falls directly
within the rule stated by Mr. Justice Gray that when one delivers
an article, which he knows to be dangerous to another person,
without notice of its nature and qualities, he is liable for an injury
which may be reasonably contemplated as likely to result, and which
does in fact result therefrom, to that person or to any other who is not
himself in fault. The natural, probable, and inevitable result of the
negligence portrayed by this complaint in delivering this machine
when it was known to be in a condition so imminently dangerous to
the lives and limbs of those who should undertake to use it for the purpose
for which it was constructed was the death, or loss of one or more
of the limbs, of some of the operators. It is perhaps improbable that
the defendant was possessed of the knowledge of the imminently
dangerous character of this threshing machine when it delivered it,
and that upon the trial of the case it will be found to fall under the
general rule which has been announced in an earlier part of this
opinion. But upon the facts alleged in this complaint, the act of
delivering it to the purchaser with a knowledge and a concealment of
its dangerous condition was so flagrant a disregard of the rule that one
is bound to avoid any act imminently dangerous to the lives and
health of his fellows that it forms the basis of a good cause of action in
favor of any one who sustained injury therefrom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the cause
must be remanded to the court below for further proceedings not
inconsistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>HEAVEN <em>v.</em> PENDER<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Court of Appeal, July 30, 1883.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 11 Queen’s Bench Division, 503.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Action to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been sustained
by the plaintiff through the negligence of the defendant. The
County Court judge gave judgment for the plaintiff. The Queen’s
Bench Division, on appeal, ordered judgment for defendant. The
plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal.<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c015'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Brett, M. R.</span> In this case the plaintiff was a workman in the employ
of Gray, a ship-painter. Gray entered into a contract with a
shipowner whose ship was in the defendant’s dock to paint the outside
of his ship. The defendant, the dock-owner, supplied, under a
contract with the shipowner, an ordinary stage to be slung in the
ordinary way outside the ship for the purpose of painting her. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>must have been known to the defendant’s servants, if they had considered
the matter at all, that the stage would be put to immediate
use, that it would not be used by the shipowner, but that it would be
used by such a person as the plaintiff, a working ship-painter. The
ropes by which the stage was slung, and which were supplied as a part
of the instrument by the defendant, had been scorched and were unfit
for use, and were supplied without a reasonably careful attention to
their condition. When the plaintiff began to use the stage the ropes
broke, the stage fell, and the plaintiff was injured. The Divisional
Court held that the plaintiff could not recover against the defendant.
The plaintiff appealed. The action is in form and substance an action
for negligence. That the stage was, through want of attention of the
defendant’s servants, supplied in a state unsafe for use is not denied.
But want of attention amounting to a want of ordinary care is not a
good cause of action although injury ensue from such want, unless
the person charged with such want of ordinary care had a duty to the
person complaining to use ordinary care in the matter called in question.
Actionable negligence consists in the neglect of the use of ordinary
care or skill toward a person to whom the defendant owes the
duty of observing ordinary care and skill, by which neglect the plaintiff,
without contributory negligence on his part, has suffered injury
to his person or property. The question in this case is whether the
defendant owed such a duty to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a person contracts with another to use ordinary care or skill toward
him or his property, the obligation need not be considered in
the light of a duty; it is an obligation of contract. It is undoubted,
however, that there may be the obligation of such a duty from one
person to another although there is no contract between them with
regard to such duty. Two drivers meeting have no contract with each
other, but under certain circumstances they have a reciprocal duty
toward each other. So two ships navigating the sea. So a railway
company which has contracted with one person to carry another has
no contract with the person carried, but has a duty toward that person.
So the owner or occupier of a house or land who permits a person
or persons to come to his house or land has no contract with such person
or persons, but has a duty toward him or them. It should be observed
that the existence of a contract between two persons does not
prevent the existence of the suggested duty between them also being
raised by law independently of the contract, by the facts with regard to
which the contract is made and to which it applies an exactly similar
but a contract duty. We have not in this case to consider the circumstances
in which an implied contract may arise to use ordinary care
and skill to avoid danger to the safety of person or property. We have
not in this case to consider the question of a fraudulent misrepresentation,
express or implied, which is a well-recognized head of law. The
questions which we have to solve in this case are: What is the proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>definition of the relation between two persons other than the relation
established by contract, or fraud, which imposes on one of them a
duty toward the other to observe, with regard to the person or property
of such other, such ordinary care or skill as may be necessary to
prevent injury to his person or property; and whether the present
case falls within such definition? When two drivers or two ships are
approaching each other, such a relation arises between them when
they are approaching each other in such a manner that, unless they
use ordinary care and skill to avoid it, there will be danger of an
injurious collision between them. This relation is established in such
circumstances between them, not only if it be proved that they
actually know and think of this danger, but whether such proof be
made or not. It is established, as it seems to me, because any one of
ordinary sense who did think would at once recognize that if he did
not use ordinary care and skill under such circumstances there would
be such danger. And every one ought, by the universally recognized
rules of right and wrong, to think so much with regard to the safety of
others who may be jeopardized by his conduct; and if, being in such
circumstances, he does not think, and in consequence neglects, or if he
neglects to use ordinary care and skill, and injury ensue, the law,
which takes cognizance of and enforces the rules of right and wrong,
will force him to give an indemnity for the injury. In the case of a
railway company carrying a passenger with whom it has not entered
into the contract of carriage, the law implies the duty, because it
must be obvious that unless ordinary care and skill be used the personal
safety of the passenger must be endangered. With regard to
the condition in which an owner or occupier leaves his house or property
other phraseology has been used, which it is necessary to consider.
If a man opens his shop or warehouse to customers it is said that he
invites them to enter, and that this invitation raises the relation between
them which imposes on the inviter the duty of using reasonable
care so to keep his house or warehouse that it may not endanger the
person or property of the person invited. This is in a sense an accurate
phrase, and as applied to the circumstances a sufficiently accurate
phrase. Yet it is not accurate if the word “invitation” be used in
its ordinary sense. By opening a shop you do not really invite, you
do not ask A. B. to come in to buy; you intimate to him that if it
pleases him to come in he will find things which you are willing to
sell. So in the case of shop, warehouse, road, or premises, the phrase
has been used that if you permit a person to enter them you impose
on yourself a duty not to lay a trap for him. This, again, is in a sense
a true statement of the duty arising from the relation constituted by
the permission to enter. It is not a statement of what causes the
relation which raises the duty. What causes the relation is the permission
to enter and the entry. But it is not a strictly accurate statement
of the duty. To lay a trap means in ordinary language to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>something with an intention. Yet it is clear that the duty extends to
a danger the result of negligence without intention. And with regard
to both these phrases, though each covers the circumstances to which
it is particularly applied, yet it does not cover the other set of circumstances
from which an exactly similar legal liability is inferred.
It follows, as it seems to me, that there must be some larger proposition
which involves and covers both sets of circumstances. The logic
of inductive reasoning requires that where two major propositions
lead to exactly similar minor premises there must be a more remote
and larger premise which embraces both of the major propositions.
That, in the present consideration, is, as it seems to me, the same
proposition which will cover the similar legal liability inferred in the
cases of collision and carriage. The proposition which these recognized
cases suggest, and which is, therefore, to be deduced from them,
is that whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position
with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense who did
think would at once recognize that if he did not use ordinary care and
skill in his own conduct with regard to those circumstances he would
cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty
arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger. Without
displacing the other propositions to which allusion has been made as
applicable to the particular circumstances in respect of which they
have been enunciated, this proposition includes, I think, all the recognized
cases of liability. It is the only proposition which covers them
all. It may, therefore, safely be affirmed to be a true proposition,
unless some obvious case can be stated in which the liability must be
admitted to exist, and which yet is not within this proposition. There
is no such case. Let us apply this proposition to the case of one person
supplying goods or machinery or instruments or utensils, or the like,
for the purpose of their being used by another person, but with whom
there is no contract as to the supply. The proposition will stand thus:
whenever one person supplies goods, or machinery, or the like, for the
purpose of their being used by another person under such circumstances
that every one of ordinary sense would, if he thought, recognize
at once that unless he used ordinary care and skill with regard to
the condition of the thing supplied or the mode of supplying it, there
will be danger of injury to the person or property of him for whose use
the thing is supplied and who is to use it, a duty arises to use ordinary
care and skill as to the condition or manner of supplying such thing.
And for a neglect of such ordinary care or skill whereby injury happens,
a legal liability arises to be enforced by an action for negligence.
This includes the case of goods, etc., supplied to be used immediately
by a particular person or persons, or one of a class of persons, where it
would be obvious to the person supplying, if he thought that the goods
would in all probability be used at once by such persons before a reasonable
opportunity for discovering any defect which might exist, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>where the thing supplied would be of such a nature that neglect of
ordinary care or skill as to its condition or the manner of supplying it
would probably cause danger to the person or property of the person
for whose use it was supplied, and who was about to use it. It would
exclude a case in which the goods are supplied under circumstances in
which it would be a chance by whom they would be used or whether
they would be used or not, or whether they would be used before there
would probably be means of observing any defect, or where the goods
would be of such a nature that a want of care or skill as to their condition
or the manner of supplying them would not probably produce
danger of injury to person or property. The cases of vendor and
purchaser and lender and hirer under contract need not be considered,
as the liability arises under the contract, and not merely as a
duty imposed by law, though it may not be useless to observe that
it seems difficult to import the implied obligation into the contract
except in cases in which if there were no contract between the
parties the law would, according to the rule above stated, imply the
duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Examining the rule which has been above enunciated with the cases
which have been decided with regard to goods supplied for the purpose
of being used by persons with whom there is no contract, the first
case to be considered is inevitably Langridge <em>v.</em> Levy, 2 M. &amp; W. 519;
4 id. 337. It is not an easy case to act upon. It is not, it cannot be,
accurately reported; the declaration is set out; the evidence is assumed
to be reported; the questions left to the jury are stated. And
then it is said that a motion was made to enter a nonsuit in pursuance
of leave reserved on particular grounds. These grounds do not raise
the question of fraud at all, but only the question of remoteness. And
although the question of fraud seems in a sense to have been left to
the jury, yet no question was, according to the report, left to them
as to whether the plaintiff acted on the faith of the fraudulent misrepresentation,
which is, nevertheless, a necessary question in a case
of fraudulent misrepresentation. The report of the argument makes
the object of the argument depend entirely upon an assumed motion
to arrest the judgment, which raises always a discussion depending
entirely on the form of the declaration, and the effect on it of a verdict,
in respect of which it is assumed that all questions were left to
the jury. If this was the point taken the report of the evidence and
of the questions left to the jury is idle! The case was decided on the
ground of a fraudulent misrepresentation as stated in the declaration.
It is inferred that the defendant intended the representation to be
communicated to the son. Why he should have such an intention in
fact it seems difficult to understand. His immediate object must
have been to induce the father to buy and pay for the gun. It must
have been wholly indifferent to him whether, after the sale and payment,
the gun would be used or not by the son. I cannot hesitate to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>say that, in my opinion, the case is a wholly unsatisfactory case to act
on as an authority. But taking the case to be decided on the ground
of a fraudulent misrepresentation made hypothetically to the son,
and acted upon by him, such a decision upon such a ground in no
way negatives the proposition that the action might have been supported
on the ground of negligence without fraud. It seems to be a
case which is within the proposition enunciated in this judgment, and
in which the action might have been supported without proof of actual
fraud. And this seems to be the meaning of Cleasby, B., in the observations
he made on Langridge <em>v.</em> Levy, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, in the case of George
<em>v.</em> Skivington, L. R. 5 Ex. 1, 5. In that case the proposition laid down
in that judgment is clearly adopted. The ground of the decision is
that the article was, to the knowledge of the defendant, supplied for
the use of the wife and for her immediate use. And certainly, if he
or any one in his position had thought at all, it must have been obvious
that a want of ordinary care or skill in preparing the prescription sold
would endanger the personal safety of the wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Corby <em>v.</em> Hill, 4 C. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 556, it is stated by the Lord Chief
Justice that an allurement was held out to the plaintiff. And Willes,
J., stated that the defendant had no right to set a trap for the plaintiff.
But in the form of declaration suggested by Willes, J., on p. 567, there
is no mention of allurement, or invitation or trap. The facts suggested
in that form are, “that the plaintiff had license to go on the road,
that he was in consequence accustomed and likely to pass along it,
that the defendant knew of that custom and probability, that the
defendant negligently placed slates in such a manner as to be likely
to prove dangerous to persons driving along the road, that the plaintiff
drove along the road, being by reason of the license lawfully on the
road, and that he was injured by the obstruction.” It is impossible
to state a case more exactly within the proposition laid down in this
judgment. In Smith <em>v.</em> London &amp; St. Katharine Docks Co., L. R.
3 C. P. 326, the phrase is again used of invitation to the plaintiff by
the defendants. Again, let it be observed that there is no objection
to the phrase as applied to the case. But the real value of the phrase
may not improperly be said to be that invitation imports knowledge
by the defendant of the probable use by the plaintiff of the article supplied,
and therefore carries with it the relation between the parties
which establishes the duty. In Indermaur <em>v.</em> Dames, L. R. 1 C. P. 274,
L. R. 2 C. P. 311, reliance is again placed upon a supposed invitation
of the plaintiff by the defendant. But, again, it is hardly possible to
state facts which bring a case more completely within the definition of
the present judgment. In Winterbottom <em>v.</em> Wright, 10 M. &amp; W. 109,
it was held that there was no duty cast upon the defendant with
regard to the plaintiff. The case was decided on what was equivalent
to a general demurrer to the declaration. And the declaration does
not seem to show that the defendant, if he had thought about it, must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>have known, or ought to have known, that the coach would be necessarily
or probably driven by the plaintiff, or by any class of which he
could be said to be one, or that it would be so driven within any time
which would make it probable that the defect would not be observed.
The declaration relied too much on contracts entered into with other
persons than the plaintiff. The facts alleged did not bring the case
within the proposition herein enunciated. It was an attempt to establish
a duty toward all the world. The case was decided on the ground
of remoteness. And it is as to too great a remoteness that the observation
of Lord Abinger is pointed, when he says that the doctrine of
Langridge <em>v.</em> Levy, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, is not to be extended. In Francis <em>v.</em> Cockrell,
L. R. 5 Q. B. 501, the decision is put by some of the judges on an implied
contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. But Cleasby,
B. (p. 515), puts it upon the duty raised by the knowledge of the defendant
that the stand was to be used immediately by persons of
whom the plaintiff was one. In other words, he acts upon the rule
above laid down. In Collis <em>v.</em> Selden, L. R. 3 C. P. 495, it was held
that the declaration disclosed no duty. And obviously, the declaration
was too uncertain. There is nothing to show that the defendant
knew more of the probability of the plaintiff rather than any other
of the public being near the chandelier. There is nothing to show
that the plaintiff was more likely to be in the public-house than any
other member of the public. There is nothing to show how soon
after the hanging of the chandelier any one might be expected or
permitted to enter the room in which it was. The facts stated do not
bring it within the rule. There is an American case: Thomas <em>v.</em>
Winchester, 6 N. Y. 397, 57 Am. Dec. 455, cited in Mr. Horace
Smith’s Treatise on the Law of Negligence, p. 88, note (t), which
goes a very long way. I doubt whether it does not go too far. In
Longmeid <em>v.</em> Holliday, 6 Ex. 761, a lamp was sold to the plaintiff to
be used by the wife. The jury were not satisfied that the defendant
knew of the defect in the lamp. If he did, there was fraud; if he did
not, there seems to have been no evidence of negligence. If there was
fraud, the case was more than within the rule. If there was no fraud
the case was not brought by other circumstances within the rule. In
Gautret <em>v.</em> Egerton, L. R. 2 C. P. 374, the declaration was held by
Willes, J., to be bad on demurrer, because it did not show that the
defendant had any reason to suppose that persons going to the docks
would not have ample means of seeing the holes and cuttings relied
on. He does not say there must be fraud in order to support the action.
He says there must be something like fraud. He says: “Every man
is bound not wilfully to deceive others.” And then, in the alternative,
he says: “or to do any act which may place them in danger.” There
seems to be no case in conflict with the rule above deduced from well
admitted cases. I am, therefore, of opinion that it is a good, safe,
and just rule.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>I cannot conceive that if the facts were proved which would make
out the proposition I have enunciated, the law can be that there would
be no liability. Unless that be true, the proposition must be true.
If it be the rule the present case is clearly within it. This case is also,
I agree, within that which seems to me to be a minor proposition,
namely, the proposition which has been often acted upon, that there
was in a sense an invitation of the plaintiff by the defendant to use the
stage. The appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed, and judgment
must be entered for the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cotton, L. J.</span>, <span class='sc'>Bowen, L. J.</span>, concurs in the judgment I am about
to read. [The opinion holds defendant liable, on the ground that he
must be considered as having invited the workman to use the dock
and all appliances provided by the dock-owner as incident to the use
of the dock; and that he was under obligation to take reasonable care
that at the time the appliances provided for immediate use in the
dock were furnished by him they were in a fit state to be used. The
opinion then proceeds as follows:—]</p>

<p class='c007'>This decides this appeal in favor of the plaintiff, and I am unwilling
to concur with the Master of the Rolls in laying down unnecessarily
the larger principle which he entertains, inasmuch as there are many
cases in which the principle was impliedly negatived.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take, for instance, the case of Langridge <em>v.</em> Levy, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, to which
the principle, if it existed, would have applied. But the judges who
decided that case based their judgment on the fraudulent representation
made to the father of the plaintiff by the defendant. In other
cases where the decision has been referred to, judges have treated
fraud as the ground of the decision; as was done by Coleridge, J., in
Blackmore <em>v.</em> Bristol &amp; Exeter Ry. Co., 8 E. &amp; B. 1035; and in Collis
<em>v.</em> Selden, L. R. 3 C. P. 495, Willes, J., says that the judgment in
Langridge <em>v.</em> Levy, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, was based on the fraud of the defendant.
This impliedly negatives the existence of the larger general principle
which is relied on, and the decisions in Collis <em>v.</em> Selden, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, and in
Longmeid <em>v.</em> Holliday, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i> (in each of which the plaintiff failed),
are, in my opinion, at variance with the principle contended for. The
case of George <em>v.</em> Skivington, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, and especially what is said by
Cleasby, B., in giving judgment in that case, seems to support the
existence of the general principle. But it is not in terms laid down
that any such principle exists, and the case was decided by Cleasby,
B., on the ground that the negligence of the defendant which was his
own personal negligence was equivalent, for the purposes of that
action, to fraud, on which (as he said) the decision in Langridge <em>v.</em>
Levy, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, was based.<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c015'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In declining to concur in laying down the principle enunciated by
the Master of the Rolls, I in no way intimate any doubt as to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>principle that any one who leaves a dangerous instrument, as a gun,
in such a way as to cause danger, or who without due warning supplies
to others for use an instrument or thing which to his knowledge,
from its construction or otherwise, is in such a condition as to cause
danger, not necessarily incident to the use of such an instrument or
thing, is liable for injury caused to others by reason of his negligent
act.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the reasons stated I agree that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment,
though I do not entirely concur with the reasoning of the
Master of the Rolls.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>MacPHERSON <em>v.</em> BUICK MOTOR COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>Court of Appeals, New York, March 14, 1916.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 217 New York Reports, 382.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Cardozo, J.</span> The defendant is a manufacturer of automobiles. It
sold an automobile to a retail dealer. The retail dealer resold to the
plaintiff. While the plaintiff was in the car it suddenly collapsed.
He was thrown out and injured. One of the wheels was made of defective
wood, and its spokes crumbled into fragments. The wheel
was not made by the defendant; it was bought from another manufacturer.
There is evidence, however, that its defects could have been
discovered by reasonable inspection, and that inspection was omitted.
There is no claim that the defendant knew of the defect and wilfully
concealed it. The case, in other words, is not brought within the rule
of Kuelling <em>v.</em> Lean Mfg. Co., 183 N. Y. 78, 75 N. E. 1098, 2 L. R. A.
(<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 303, 111 Am. St. Rep. 691, 5 Ann. Cas. 124. The charge is
one, not of fraud, but of negligence. The question to be determined is
whether the defendant owed a duty of care and vigilance to any one
but the immediate purchaser.</p>

<p class='c007'>The foundations of this branch of the law, at least in this state,
were laid in Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester, 6 N. Y. 397, 57 Am. Dec. 455.
A poison was falsely labelled. The sale was made to a druggist, who
in turn sold to a customer. The customer recovered damages from
the seller who affixed the label. “The defendant’s negligence,” it was
said, “put human life in imminent danger.” A poison, falsely
labelled, is likely to injure any one who gets it. Because the danger is
to be foreseen, there is a duty to avoid the injury. Cases were cited
by way of illustration in which manufacturers were not subject to
any duty irrespective of contract. The distinction was said to be
that their conduct, though negligent, was not likely to result in injury
to any one except the purchaser. We are not required to say
whether the chance of injury was always as remote as the distinction
assumes. Some of the illustrations might be rejected to-day. The
principle of the distinction is, for present purposes, the important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>thing. Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester became quickly a landmark of the law.
In the application of its principle there may, at times, have been
uncertainty or even error. There has never in this state been doubt
or disavowal of the principle itself. The chief cases are well known,
yet to recall some of them will be helpful. Loop <em>v.</em> Litchfield, 42
N. Y. 351, 1 Am. Rep. 513, is the earliest. It was the case of a defect
in a small balance wheel used on a circular saw. The manufacturer
pointed out the defect to the buyer, who wished a cheap article and
was ready to assume the risk. The risk can hardly have been an
imminent one, for the wheel lasted five years before it broke. In the
meanwhile the buyer had made a lease of the machinery. It was held
that the manufacturer was not answerable to the lessee. Loop <em>v.</em>
Litchfield was followed in Losee <em>v.</em> Clute, 51 N. Y. 494, 10 Am. Rep.
638, the case of the explosion of a steam boiler. That decision has
been criticized (Thompson on Negligence, 233; Shearman &amp; Redfield
on Negligence, [6th ed.] § 117); but it must be confined to its
special facts. It was put upon the ground that the risk of injury was
too remote. The buyer in that case had not only accepted the boiler,
but had tested it. The manufacturer knew that his own test was not
the final one. The finality of the test has a bearing on the measure of
diligence owing to persons other than the purchaser. Beven, Negligence,
(3d ed.) pp. 50, 51, 54; Wharton, Negligence, (2d ed.) § 134.</p>

<p class='c007'>These early cases suggest a narrow construction of the rule. Later
cases, however, evince a more liberal spirit. First in importance is
Devlin <em>v.</em> Smith, 89 N. Y. 470, 42 Am. Rep. 311. The defendant, a
contractor, built a scaffold for a painter. The painter’s servants were
injured. The contractor was held liable. He knew that the scaffold,
if improperly constructed, was a most dangerous trap. He knew that
it was to be used by the workmen. He was building it for that very
purpose. Building it for their use, he owed them a duty, irrespective
of his contract with their master, to build it with care.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Devlin <em>v.</em> Smith we pass over intermediate cases and turn to
the latest case in this court in which Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester was followed.
That case is Statler <em>v.</em> Ray Mfg. Co., 195 N. Y. 478, 480,
88 N. E. 1063. The defendant manufactured a large coffee urn. It
was installed in a restaurant. When heated, the urn exploded and
injured the plaintiff. We held that the manufacturer was liable.
We said that the urn “was of such a character inherently that, when
applied to the purposes for which it was designed, it was liable to
become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and
properly constructed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be that Devlin <em>v.</em> Smith and Statler <em>v.</em> Ray Mfg. Co. have
extended the rule of Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester. If so, this court is committed
to the extension. The defendant argues that things imminently
dangerous to life are poisons, explosives, deadly weapons—things
whose normal function it is to injure or destroy. But whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>the rule in Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester may once have been, it has no longer
that restricted meaning. A scaffold (Devlin <em>v.</em> Smith, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>) is not
inherently a destructive instrument. It becomes destructive only if
imperfectly constructed. A large coffee urn (Statler <em>v.</em> Ray Mfg.
Co., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>) may have within itself, if negligently made, the potency
of danger, yet no one thinks of it as an implement whose normal
function is destruction. What is true of the coffee urn is equally true
of bottles of aerated water. Torgesen <em>v.</em> Schultz, 192 N. Y. 156, 84
N. E. 956, 18 L. R. A. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 726, 127 Am. St. Rep. 894. We have
mentioned only cases in this court. But the rule has received a like
extension in our courts of intermediate appeal. In Burke <em>v.</em> Ireland,
26 App. Div. 487, 50 N. Y. Supp. 369, in an opinion by Cullen, J., it
was applied to a builder who constructed a defective building; in
Kahner <em>v.</em> Otis Elevator Co., 96 App. Div. 169, 89 N. Y. Supp. 185,
to the manufacturer of an elevator; in Davies <em>v.</em> Pelham Hod Elevating
Co., 65 Hun, 573, 20 N. Y. Supp. 523, affirmed in this court without
opinion, 146 N. Y. 363, 41 N. E. 88, to a contractor who furnished a
defective rope with knowledge of the purpose for which the rope was
to be used. We are not required at this time either to approve or to
disapprove the application of the rule that was made in these cases. It
is enough that they help to characterize the trend of judicial thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>Devlin <em>v.</em> Smith was decided in 1882. A year later a very similar
case came before the Court of Appeal in England (Heaven <em>v.</em> Pender,
11 Q. B. D. 503). We find in the opinion of Brett, M. R., afterwards
Lord Esher, the same conception of a duty, irrespective of contract,
imposed upon the manufacturer by the law itself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whenever one person supplies goods or machinery, or the like,
for the purpose of their being used by another person under such
circumstances that every one of ordinary sense would, if he thought,
recognize at once that unless he used ordinary care and skill with
regard to the condition of the thing supplied, or the mode of supplying
it, there will be danger of injury to the person or property of him
for whose use the thing is supplied, and who is to use it, a duty arises
to use ordinary care and skill as to the condition or manner of supplying
such thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then points out that for a neglect of such ordinary care or skill
whereby injury happens, the appropriate remedy is an action for
negligence. The right to enforce this liability is not to be confined
to the immediate buyer. The right, he says, extends to the persons
or class of persons for whose use the thing is supplied. It is enough
that the goods “would in all probability be used at once&#160;... before
a reasonable opportunity for discovering any defect which might
exist,” and that the thing supplied is of such a nature “that a neglect
of ordinary care or skill as to its condition or the manner of supplying
it would probably cause danger to the person or property of the
person for whose use it was supplied, and who was about to use it.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>On the other hand, he would exclude a case “in which the goods
are supplied under circumstances in which it would be a chance by
whom they would be used or whether they would be used or not, or
whether they would be used before there would probably be means
of observing any defect,” or where the goods are of such a nature
that “a want of care or skill as to their condition or the manner of
supplying them would not probably produce danger of injury to person
or property.” What was said by Lord Esher in that case did not
command the full assent of his associates. His opinion has been
criticized “as requiring every man to take affirmative precautions to
protect his neighbors as well as to refrain from injuring them.”
Bohlen, Affirmative Obligations in the Law of Torts, 44 Am. Law
Reg. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 341. It may not be an accurate exposition of the law
of England. Perhaps it may need some qualification even in our own
state. Like most attempts at comprehensive definition, it may involve
errors of inclusion and of exclusion. But its tests and standards, at
least in their underlying principles with whatever qualification may
be called for as they are applied to varying conditions, are the tests
and standards of our law.</p>

<p class='c007'>We hold, then, that the principle of Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester is not
limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things
which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If
the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life
and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger.
Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to
the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will
be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new
tests, then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of
danger is under a duty to make it carefully. That is as far as we are
required to go for the decision of this case. There must be knowledge
of a danger, not merely possible, but probable. It is possible to use
almost anything in a way that will make it dangerous if defective.
That is not enough to charge the manufacturer with a duty independent
of his contract. Whether a given thing is dangerous may
be sometimes a question for the court and sometimes a question for
the jury. There must also be knowledge that in the usual course of
events the danger will be shared by others than the buyer. Such
knowledge may often be inferred from the nature of the transaction.
But it is possible that even knowledge of the danger and of the use
will not always be enough. The proximity or remoteness of the relation
is a factor to be considered. We are dealing now with the liability
of the manufacturer of the finished product, who puts it on
the market to be used without inspection by his customers. If he is
negligent, where danger is to be foreseen, a liability will follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are not required at this time to say that it is legitimate to go
back of the manufacturer of the finished product and hold the manufacturers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>of the component parts. To make their negligence a cause
of imminent danger, an independent cause must often intervene; the
manufacturer of the finished product must also fail in his duty of
inspection. It may be that in those circumstances the negligence of
the earlier members of the series is too remote to constitute, as to the
ultimate user, an actionable wrong. Beven on Negligence, (3d ed.)
50, 51, 54; Wharton on Negligence, (2d ed.) § 134; Leeds <em>v.</em> N. Y.
Tel. Co., 178 N. Y. 118, 70 N. E. 219; Sweet <em>v.</em> Perkins, 196 N. Y.
482, 90 N. E. 50; Hayes <em>v.</em> Hyde Park, 153 Mass. 514, 516, 27 N. E.
522, 12 L. R. A. 249. We leave that question open. We shall have to
deal with it when it arises. The difficulty which it suggests is not
present in this case. There is here no break in the chain of cause and
effect. In such circumstances, the presence of a known danger, attendant
upon a known use, makes vigilance a duty. We have put
aside the notion that the duty to safeguard life and limb, when the
consequences of negligence may be foreseen, grows out of contract and
nothing else. We have put the source of the obligation where it ought
to be. We have put its source in the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this survey of the decisions, there thus emerges a definition of
the duty of a manufacturer which enables us to measure this defendant’s
liability. Beyond all question, the nature of an automobile gives
warning of probable danger if its construction is defective. This
automobile was designed to go 50 miles an hour. Unless its wheels
were sound and strong, injury was almost certain. It was as much
a thing of danger as a defective engine for a railroad. The defendant
knew the danger. It knew also that the car would be used by persons
other than the buyer. This was apparent from its size; there were
seats for three persons. It was apparent also from the fact that the
buyer was a dealer in cars, who bought to resell. The maker of this
car supplied it for the use of purchasers from the dealer just as plainly
as the contractor in Devlin <em>v.</em> Smith supplied the scaffold for use by
the servants of the owner. The dealer was indeed the one person of
whom it might be said with some approach to certainty that by him
the car would not be used. Yet the defendant would have us say
that he was the one person whom it was under a legal duty to protect.
The law does not lead us to so inconsequent a conclusion. Precedents
drawn from the days of travel by stage-coach do not fit the conditions
of travel to-day. The principle that the danger must be imminent
does not change, but the things subject to the principle do change.
They are whatever the needs of life in a developing civilization
requires them to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>In reaching this conclusion, we do not ignore the decisions to the
contrary in other jurisdictions. It was held in Cadillac Co. <em>v.</em> Johnson,
221 Fed. 801, 137 C. C. A. 279, L. R. A. 1915E, 287, that an
automobile is not within the rule of Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester. There
was, however, a vigorous dissent. Opposed to that decision is one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the Court of Appeals of Kentucky. Olds Motor Works <em>v.</em> Shaffer,
145 Ky. 616, 140 S. W. 1047, 37 L. R. A. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 560, Ann. Cas. 1913B,
689. The earlier cases are summarized by Judge Sanborn in Huset <em>v.</em>
J. I. Case Threshing Machine Co., 120 Fed. 865, 57 C. C. A. 237, 61
L. R. A. 303. Some of them, at first sight inconsistent with our conclusion,
may be reconciled upon the ground that the negligence was
too remote, and that another cause had intervened. But even when
they cannot be reconciled the difference is rather in the application of
the principle than in the principle itself. Judge Sanborn says, for
example, that the contractor who builds a bridge, or the manufacturer
who builds a car, cannot ordinarily foresee injury to other persons
than the owner as the probable result. 120 Fed. 865, at page 867, 57
C. C. A. 237, at page 239, 61 L. R. A. 303. We take a different view.
We think that injury to others is to be foreseen not merely as a possible,
but as an almost inevitable result. See the trenchant criticism in
Bohlen, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, at page 351. Indeed, Judge Sanborn concedes that his
view is not to be reconciled with our decision in Devlin <em>v.</em> Smith, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>.
The doctrine of that decision has now become the settled law of this
state, and we have no desire to depart from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In England the limits of the rule are still unsettled. Winterbottom
<em>v.</em> Wright, 10 M. &amp; W. 109, is often cited. The defendant undertook
to provide a mail coach to carry the mail bags. The coach broke down
from latent defects in its construction. The defendant, however, was
not the manufacturer. The court held that he was not liable for injuries
to a passenger. The case was decided on a demurrer to the
declaration. Lord Esher points out in Heaven <em>v.</em> Pender, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, at
page 513, that the form of the declaration was subject to criticism.
It did not fairly suggest the existence of a duty aside from the special
contract which was the plaintiff’s main reliance. See the criticism of
Winterbottom <em>v.</em> Wright, in Bohlen, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, at pages 281, 283. At all
events, in Heaven <em>v.</em> Pender, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, the defendant, a dock owner, who
put up a staging outside a ship, was held liable to the servants of the
shipowner. In Elliot <em>v.</em> Hall, 15 Q. B. D. 315, the defendant sent out
a defective truck laden with goods which he had sold. The buyer’s
servants unloaded it, and were injured because of the defects. It was
held that the defendant was under a duty “not to be guilty of negligence
with regard to the state and condition of the truck.” There
seems to have been a return to the doctrine of Winterbottom <em>v.</em> Wright
in Earl <em>v.</em> Lubbock, [1905] 1 K. B. 253. In that case, however, as
in the earlier one, the defendant was not the manufacturer. He had
merely made a contract to keep the van in repair. A later case (White
<em>v.</em> Steadman, [1913] 3 K. B. 340, 348) emphasizes that element. A
livery stable keeper who sent out a vicious horse was held liable, not
merely to his customer, but also to another occupant of the carriage,
and Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester was cited and followed, White <em>v.</em> Steadman,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, at pages 348, 349. It was again cited and followed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Dominion Natural Gas Co. <em>v.</em> Collins, [1909] A. C. 640, 646. From
these cases a consistent principle is with difficulty extracted. The
English courts, however, agree with ours in holding that one who
invites another to make use of an appliance is bound to the exercise of
reasonable care. Caledonian Ry. Co. <em>v.</em> Mulholland, [1898] A. C.
216, 227; Indermaur <em>v.</em> Dames, L. R. 1 C. P. 274. That at bottom
is the underlying principle of Devlin <em>v.</em> Smith. The contractor who
builds the scaffold invites the owner’s workmen to use it. The manufacturer
who sells the automobile to the retail dealer invites the dealer’s
customers to use it. The invitation is addressed in the one case
to determinate persons and in the other to an indeterminate class,
but in each case it is equally plain, and in each its consequences must
be the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is nothing anomalous in a rule which imposes upon A., who
has contracted with B., a duty to C. and D. and others according as he
knows or does not know that the subject-matter of the contract is intended
for their use. We may find an analogy in the law which measures
the liability of landlords. If A. leases to B. a tumble-down
house, he is not liable, in the absence of fraud, to B.’s guests who enter
it and are injured. This is because B. is then under the duty to repair
it, the lessor has the right to suppose that he will fulfill that duty,
and, if he omits to do so, his guests must look to him. Bohlen, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,
at page 276. But if A. leases a building to be used by the lessee at
once as a place of public entertainment, the rule is different. There
injury to persons other than the lessee is to be foreseen, and foresight
of the consequences involves the creation of a duty. Junkermann <em>v.</em>
Tilyou R. Co., 213 N. Y. 404, 108 N. E. 190, L. R. A. 1915F, 700,
and cases there cited.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this view of the defendant’s liability there is nothing inconsistent
with the theory of liability on which the case was tried. It is true
that the court told the jury that “an automobile is not an inherently
dangerous vehicle.” The meaning, however, is made plain by the
context. The meaning is that danger is not to be expected when the
vehicle is well constructed. The court left it to the jury to say whether
the defendant ought to have foreseen that the car, if negligently constructed,
would become “imminently dangerous.” Subtle distinctions
are drawn by the defendant between things inherently dangerous
and things imminently dangerous, but the case does not turn upon
these verbal niceties. If danger was to be expected as reasonably
certain, there was a duty of vigilance, and this whether you call the
danger inherent or imminent. In varying forms that thought was
put before the jury. We do not say that the court would not have
been justified in ruling as a matter of law that the car was a dangerous
thing. If there was any error, it was none of which the defendant
can complain.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>We think the defendant was not absolved from a duty of inspection
because it bought the wheels from a reputable manufacturer. It was
not merely a dealer in automobiles. It was a manufacturer of automobiles.
It was responsible for the finished product. It was not at
liberty to put the finished product on the market without subjecting
the component parts to ordinary and simple tests. Richmond &amp;
Danville R. R. Co. <em>v.</em> Elliott, 149 U. S. 266, 272, 13 Sup. Ct. 837, 37
L. Ed. 728. Under the charge of the trial judge nothing more was
required of it. The obligation to inspect must vary with the nature of
the thing to be inspected. The more probable the danger the greater
the need of caution.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is little analogy between this case and Carlson <em>v.</em> Phoenix
Bridge Co., 132 N. Y. 273, 30 N. E. 750, where the defendant bought
a tool for a servant’s use. The making of tools was not the business in
which the master was engaged. Reliance on the skill of the manufacturer
was proper and almost inevitable. But that is not the defendant’s
situation. Both by its relation to the work and by the nature of
its business, it is charged with a stricter duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other rulings complained of have been considered, but no error has
been found in them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Willard Bartlett, C. J.</span> (dissenting). The plaintiff was injured
in consequence of the collapse of a wheel of an automobile manufactured
by the defendant corporation which sold it to a firm of automobile
dealers in Schenectady, who in turn sold the car to the plaintiff.
The wheel was purchased by the Buick Motor Company, ready made,
from the Imperial Wheel Company of Flint, Mich., a reputable manufacturer
of automobile wheels which had furnished the defendant with
80,000 wheels, none of which had proved to be made of defective wood
prior to the accident in the present case. The defendant relied upon
the wheel manufacturer to make all necessary tests as to the strength
of the material therein, and made no such test itself. The present
suit is an action for negligence, brought by the subvendee of the motor
car against the manufacturer as the original vendor. The evidence
warranted a finding by the jury that the wheel which collapsed was
defective when it left the hands of the defendant. The automobile
was being prudently operated at the time of the accident, and was
moving at a speed of only eight miles an hour. There was no allegation
or proof of any actual knowledge of the defect on the part of the
defendant, or any suggestion that any element of fraud or deceit or
misrepresentation entered into the sale.</p>

<p class='c007'>The theory upon which the case was submitted to the jury by the
learned judge who presided at the trial was that, although an automobile
is not an inherently dangerous vehicle, it may become such if
equipped with a weak wheel; and that if the motor car in question,
when it was put upon the market was in itself inherently dangerous by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>reason of its being equipped with a weak wheel, the defendant was
chargeable with a knowledge of the defect so far as it might be discovered
by a reasonable inspection and the application of reasonable
tests. This liability, it was further held, was not limited to the original
vendee, but extended to a subvendee like the plaintiff, who was
not a party to the original contract of sale.</p>

<p class='c007'>I think that these rulings, which have been approved by the Appellate
Division, extend the liability of the vendor of a manufactured
article further than any case which has yet received the sanction of
this court. It has heretofore been held in this state that the liability
of the vendor of a manufactured article for negligence arising out of
the existence of defects therein does not extend to strangers injured
in consequence of such defects, but is confined to the immediate vendee.
The exceptions to this general rule which have thus far been
recognized in New York are cases in which the article sold was of
such a character that danger to life or limb was involved in the ordinary
use thereof; in other words, where the article sold was inherently
dangerous. As has already been pointed out, the learned trial
judge instructed the jury that an automobile is not an inherently
dangerous vehicle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The late Chief Justice Cooley of Michigan, one of the most learned
and accurate of American law writers, states the general rule thus:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The general rule is that a contractor, manufacturer, vendor or
furnisher of an article is not liable to third parties who have no contractual
relations with him, for negligence in the construction, manufacture
or sale of such article.” 2 Cooley on Torts, (3d ed.) 1486.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leading English authority in support of this rule, to which all
the later cases on the same subject refer, is Winterbottom <em>v.</em> Wright,
10 Meeson &amp; Welsby, 109, which was an action by the driver of a
stage-coach against a contractor who had agreed with the postmaster
general to provide and keep the vehicle in repair for the purpose of
conveying the royal mail over a prescribed route. The coach broke
down and upset, injuring the driver, who sought to recover against
the contractor on account of its defective construction. The Court of
Exchequer denied him any right of recovery on the ground that there
was no privity of contract between the parties, the agreement having
been made with the postmaster general alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the plaintiff can sue,” said Lord Abinger, the Chief Baron,
“every passenger or even any person passing along the road who was
injured by the upsetting of the coach might bring a similar action.
Unless we confine the operation of such contracts as this to the parties
who enter into them the most absurd and outrageous consequences,
to which I can see no limit, would ensue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine of that decision was recognized as the law of this
state by the leading New York case of Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester, 6 N. Y.
397, 408, 57 Am. Dec. 455, which, however, involved an exception to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>the general rule. There the defendant, who was a dealer in medicines,
sold to a druggist a quantity of belladonna, which is a deadly poison,
negligently labelled as extract of dandelion. The druggist in good
faith used the poison in filling a prescription calling for the harmless
dandelion extract, and the plaintiff for whom the prescription was put
up was poisoned by the belladonna. This court held that the original
vendor was liable for the injuries suffered by the patient. Chief Judge
Ruggles, who delivered the opinion of the court, distinguished between
an act of negligence imminently dangerous to the lives of others and
one that is not so, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If A. build a wagon and sell it to B., who sells it to C., and C.
hires it to D., who in consequence of the gross negligence of A. in
building the wagon is overturned and injured, D. cannot recover
damages against A., the builder. A.’s obligation to build the wagon
faithfully arises solely out of his contract with B. The public have
nothing to do with it.... So, for the same reason, if a horse be
defectively shod by a smith, and a person hiring the horse from the
owner is thrown and injured in consequence of the smith’s negligence
in shoeing, the smith is not liable for the injury.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Torgesen <em>v.</em> Schultz, 192 N. Y. 156, 159, 84 N. E. 956, 18 L. R. A.
(<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 726, 127 Am. St. Rep. 894, the defendant was the vendor of
bottles of aerated water which were charged under high pressure and
likely to explode unless used with precaution when exposed to sudden
changes of temperature. The plaintiff, who was a servant of the purchaser,
was injured by the explosion of one of these bottles. There
was evidence tending to show that it had not been properly tested in
order to insure users against such accidents. We held that the defendant
corporation was liable notwithstanding the absence of any contract
relation between it and the plaintiff “under the doctrine of
Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, and similar cases based upon the duty
of the vendor of an article dangerous in its nature or likely to become
so in the course of the ordinary usage to be contemplated by the vendor,
either to exercise due care to warn users of the danger or to take
reasonable care to prevent the article sold from proving dangerous
when subjected only to customary usage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The character of the exception to the general rule limiting liability
for negligence to the original parties to the contract of sale, was still
more clearly stated by Judge Hiscock, writing for the court in Statler
<em>v.</em> Ray Manufacturing Co., 195 N. Y. 478, 482, 88 N. E. 1063, where
he said that:</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the case of an article of an inherently dangerous nature, a
manufacturer may become liable for a negligent construction which,
when added to the inherent character of the appliance, makes it
imminently dangerous, and causes or contributes to a resulting injury
not necessarily incident to the use of such an article if properly
constructed, but naturally following from a defective construction.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>In that case the injuries were inflicted by the explosion of a battery
of steam-driven coffee urns, constituting an appliance liable to become
dangerous in the course of ordinary usage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case of Devlin <em>v.</em> Smith, 89 N. Y. 470, 42 Am. Rep. 311, is
cited as an authority in conflict with the view that the liability of the
manufacturer and vendor extends to third parties only when the
article manufactured and sold is inherently dangerous. In that case
the builder of a scaffold 90 feet high, which was erected for the purpose
of enabling painters to stand upon it, was held to be liable to the
administratrix of a painter who fell therefrom and was killed, being
at the time in the employ of the person for whom the scaffold was
built. It is said that the scaffold, if properly constructed, was not
inherently dangerous, and hence that this decision affirms the existence
of liability in the case of an article not dangerous in itself, but
made so only in consequence of negligent construction. Whatever
logical force there may be in this view it seems to me clear from the
language of Judge Rapallo, who wrote the opinion of the court, that
the scaffold was deemed to be an inherently dangerous structure, and
that the case was decided as it was because the court entertained that
view. Otherwise he would hardly have said, as he did, that the circumstances
seemed to bring the case fairly within the principle of
Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not see how we can uphold the judgment in the present case
without overruling what has been so often said by this court and other
courts of like authority in reference to the absence of any liability
for negligence on the part of the original vendor of an ordinary carriage
to any one except his immediate vendee. The absence of such
liability was the very point actually decided in the English case of
Winterbottom <em>v.</em> Wright, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, and the illustration quoted from the
opinion of Chief Judge Ruggles in Thomas <em>v.</em> Winchester, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,
assumes that the law on the subject was so plain that the statement
would be accepted almost as a matter of course. In the case at bar
the defective wheel on an automobile, moving only eight miles an hour,
was not any more dangerous to the occupants of the car than a similarly
defective wheel would be to the occupants of a carriage drawn
by a horse at the same speed, and yet, unless the courts have been all
wrong on this question up to the present time, there would be no liability
to strangers to the original sale in the case of the horse-drawn
carriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rule upon which, in my judgment, the determination of this
case depends, and the recognized exceptions thereto, were discussed by
Circuit Judge Sanborn, of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals
in the Eighth Circuit, in Huset <em>v.</em> J. I. Case Threshing Machine Co.,
120 Fed. 865, 57 C. C. A. 237, 61 L. R. A. 303, in an opinion which
reviews all the leading American and English decisions on the subject
up to the time when it was rendered (1903). I have already discussed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>the leading New York cases, but as to the rest I feel that I can add
nothing to the learning of that opinion or the cogency of its reasoning.
I have examined the cases to which Judge Sanborn refers, but if I
were to discuss them at length, I should be forced merely to paraphrase
his language, as a study of the authorities he cites has led me
to the same conclusion; and the repetition of what has already been
so well said would contribute nothing to the advantage of the bench,
the bar, or the individual litigants whose case is before us.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few cases decided since his opinion was written, however, may be
noticed. In Earl <em>v.</em> Lubbock, [1905] L. R. 1 K. B. Div. 253, the Court
of Appeal in 1904 considered and approved the propositions of law
laid down by the Court of Exchequer in Winterbottom <em>v.</em> Wright,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, declaring that the decision in that case, since the year 1842,
had stood the test of repeated discussion. The Master of the Rolls
approved the principles laid down by Lord Abinger as based upon
sound reasoning; and all the members of the court agreed that his
decision was a controlling authority which must be followed. That
the federal courts still adhere to the general rule, as I have stated it,
appears by the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Second
Circuit, in March, 1915, in the case of Cadillac Motor Car Co. <em>v.</em>
Johnson, 221 Fed. 801, 137 C. C. A. 279, L. R. A. 1915E, 287. That
case, like this, was an action by a subvendee against a manufacturer
of automobiles for negligence in failing to discover that one of its
wheels was defective, the court holding that such an action could not
be maintained. It is true there was a dissenting opinion in that case,
but it was based chiefly upon the proposition that rules applicable
to stage-coaches are archaic when applied to automobiles, and that if
the law did not afford a remedy to strangers to the contract, the law
should be changed. If this be true, the change should be effected by
the Legislature and not by the courts. A perusal of the opinion in
that case and in the Huset Case will disclose how uniformly the
courts throughout this country have adhered to the rule and how
consistently they have refused to broaden the scope of the exceptions.
I think we should adhere to it in the case at bar, and therefore I vote
for a reversal of this judgment.</p>

</div>

<h5 class='c013'>NEAL <em>v.</em> GILLETT<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court of Errors, Connecticut, June Term, 1855.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 23 Connecticut Reports, 437.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Action to recover for personal injury alleged to have been incurred
through the negligence of the defendants. Plaintiff claimed that the
defendants were guilty of gross negligence, as the cause of the injury;
and that, if the jury should so find, the plaintiff was entitled to recover
notwithstanding there had been on his part a want of mere ordinary
care which might have essentially contributed to produce the injury
complained of. The Court charged the jury in conformity to this
claim of the plaintiff. Verdict for plaintiff. Motion for new trial.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Sanford, J.</span> [Omitting opinion on another point.]<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c015'><sup>[176]</sup></a> The question
presented upon the second point, is, whether a plaintiff is entitled to
recover for an injury, produced by the combined operation of his own
want of “ordinary care,” and the gross negligence of the defendant.
The exact boundaries between the several degrees of care and their correlative
degrees of carelessness, or negligence, are not always clearly
defined or easily pointed out. We think, however, that by “ordinary
care,” is meant “that degree of care which may reasonably be expected
from a person in the party’s situation” (41 E. C. L. R. 425),<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c015'><sup>[177]</sup></a>
that is, “reasonable care” (19 Conn. R. 572); and that “gross negligence”
imports not a malicious intention or design to produce a
particular injury, but a thoughtless disregard of consequences; the
absence, rather than the actual exercise, of volition with reference to
results.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is the measure of “reasonable care” must of course depend
upon the circumstances of the particular situation in which the party
at the time is placed. But “reasonable care,” every one, in the enjoyment
of his rights, and the performance of his duties, is bound to
exercise at all times and under all circumstances. When he has done
that, he is answerable to no one for any consequences which ensue,
for he has done all his duty; when he has done less than that he is in
fault, and if an injury ensue to another in consequence of such fault,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>he is responsible for it; if to himself, he must bear it. If in the enjoyment
of their lawful rights by two persons, at the same time and
place, reasonable care is exercised by both, and an injury accrues to
one of them, it must be borne by the suffering party as a providential
visitation. If such care is exercised by neither party, and an injury
accrues to one of them, he must bear it, for he was himself in fault.
And we hold that when the gist of the action is negligence merely,—whether
gross or slight, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, when
his own want of ordinary, or reasonable care, has essentially contributed
to his injury; because he is himself in fault, and because of
the difficulty, if not impossibility, of ascertaining in what proportions
the parties respectively, by their negligence, have contributed to the
production of the injury, and whether it would have been produced at
all but by the combined operation of the negligence of both. When
the injury is intentional, and designed, other considerations apply.</p>

<p class='c007'>For anything this Court can see, the negligence of the defendants,
however gross, might have been entirely harmless, but for the plaintiff’s
own wrongful contribution to the combined causes which produced
his injury. And so too, for anything this Court can see, although
the defendants’ negligence was gross, and fully adequate to the production
of the injury, yet the plaintiff’s exercise of reasonable care
would have saved him from its consequences.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the recent case of Park <em>v.</em> O’Brien, 23 Conn. R. 339, this Court
said, “It is necessary for the plaintiff, to prove, first, negligence on
the part of the defendant, and, secondly, that the injury to the plaintiff
occurred in consequence of that negligence. But in order to prove
this latter point, the plaintiff must show that such injury was not
caused, wholly, or in part, by his own negligence;<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c015'><sup>[178]</sup></a> for although the
defendant was guilty of negligence, if the plaintiff’s negligence contributed
essentially to the injury, it is obvious that it did not occur by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>reason of the defendant’s negligence.” “Hence, to say that the plaintiff
must show the latter” [the want of the plaintiff’s concurring negligence],
“is only saying that he must show that the injury was owing
to the negligence of the defendant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The same reasonable doctrine is sanctioned by other decisions, in
our own Court and elsewhere. Birge <em>v.</em> Gardiner, 19 Conn. R. 507;
Beers <em>v.</em> Housatonic R. R. Co., 19 Conn. R. 566, and cases there cited.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think, therefore, that the charge of the Court, on this point, was
wrong, and that a new trial ought to be granted.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this opinion the other judges concurred, except Ellsworth, J.,
who was disqualified.</p>

<p class='c014'>Action for personal injuries alleged to be caused by the negligence
of defendant. Answer: a general denial, and a plea of contributory
negligence.<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c015'><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The judge, at the request of plaintiff, gave the following instruction:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. 7. One of the defences in this case interposed by the defendant
is that of negligence on the part of plaintiff, Claude Payne, directly
contributing to the injuries of which plaintiff complains; and the
court instructs the jury that the law devolves upon the defendant the
burden of proving such negligence by a preponderance of the evidence,
and it is not sufficient that the jury may believe from the evidence
that the plaintiff was simply guilty of negligence, but that the negligence
of plaintiff, and not that of the defendant, must be the proximate
or immediate cause of the injury, to excuse the defendant from
liability.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Circuit Court plaintiff had judgment. Defendant appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Macfarlane, J.</span> Defendant complains of instruction 7 given the
jury at the request of plaintiff. The complaint is that the instruction
improperly defines contributory negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Contributory negligence, as the word imports, implies the concurring
negligence of both plaintiff and defendant. The phrase is defined
by Beach as follows: “Contributory negligence, in its legal signification,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>is such an act or omission on the part of a plaintiff, amounting to
a want of ordinary care, as, concurring or coöperating with the negligent
act of the defendant, is a proximate cause or occasion of the
injury complained of.” Beach, Cont. Neg. [2 ed.] sect. 7. The definition
given by Shearman &amp; Redfield in their work on Negligence
(sect. 61) is in substance and effect the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the negligence of either plaintiff or defendant is the sole cause
of the injury there could be no contributory negligence in the case.
The question for the jury is whether the plaintiff could “by the exercise
of such care and skill as he was bound to exercise, have avoided
the consequence of the defendant’s negligence.” Lord Blackburn,
L. R. 3 App. Cas. 1207. See, also, 4 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyclopedia of
Law, 18 &amp; 19. It is clear that there could be no contributory negligence
unless there was also negligence of defendant to which that of
plaintiff could contribute. Unless the negligence of defendant was
the proximate cause of the injury, there could be no liability. Unless
the negligence of plaintiff was a proximate cause of the injury, his
action, on the ground of contributory negligence, would not be
defeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Testing the instruction by these rules, it cannot be approved. It
tells the jury that “the negligence of plaintiff, and not that of defendant,
must be the proximate or immediate cause of the injury to excuse
the defendant from liability.” They were told in effect that this result
would follow though “plaintiff was simply guilty of negligence.”
The jury may as well have been told that to defeat a recovery on the
plea of contributory negligence, it was necessary to find that the negligence
of plaintiff was the sole proximate cause of the injury. The
instruction ignored entirely concurring or contributory negligence of
both parties, which is one essential element of contributory negligence.
There are no degrees which distinguish the negligence made necessary
by the law to defeat a recovery. And negligence which is proximate
or a cause of the injury is sufficient. It does not matter that the concurring
and coöperating negligence of defendant was negligence, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>,
such as the violation of an ordinance, as in this case, or statute law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The instruction is also misleading wherein it informs the jury that
in order for defendant to establish its plea of contributory negligence
“it is not sufficient that the jury may believe from the evidence that
plaintiff was simply guilty of negligence,” and as qualified or explained,
by what follows, does not correctly declare the law. The
negligence to defeat a recovery must be a proximate cause for the
injury, but need not be the sole proximate cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the evidence on the issue of contributory negligence was very
clear, we think the errors in this instruction prejudicial and must
cause a reversal.<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c015'><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>[After citing decisions in other jurisdictions.] It will be seen from
these cases that the question of liability does not depend absolutely on
the absence of all negligence on the part of the plaintiff, but upon the
relative degree of care or want of care as manifested by both parties;
for all care or negligence is at best but relative, the absence of the
highest possible degree of care showing the presence of some negligence,
slight as it may be. The true doctrine, therefore, we think, is,
that in proportion to the negligence of the defendant should be measured
the degree of care required of the plaintiff; that is to say, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>more gross the negligence manifested by the defendant, the less degree
of care will be required of the plaintiff to entitle him to recover....
We say, then, that in this, as in all like cases, the degree of negligence
must be measured and considered, and whenever it shall appear
that the plaintiff’s negligence is comparatively slight and that of the
defendant gross, he shall not be deprived of his action.<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c015'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The case, as stated by the court, was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>This was a suit in Admiralty, brought in the District Court of the
United States for the Southern District of New York, by Patrick
Curry against the steamer Max Morris.<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c015'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The libel alleged that on the 27th of October, 1884, the libellant
was lawfully on board of that vessel, being employed to load coal upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>her by the stevedore who had the contract for loading the coal; that,
on that day, the libellant, while on the vessel, fell from her bridge to
the deck, through the negligence of those in charge of her, in having
removed from the bridge the ladder usually leading therefrom to the
deck, and in leaving open, and failing to guard, the aperture thus left
in the rail on the bridge; that the libellant was not guilty of negligence;
and that he was injured by the fall and incapacitated from
labor. He claimed $3000 damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer alleged negligence on the part of the libellant and an
absence of negligence on the part of the claimant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The District Court, held by Judge Brown, entered a decree in favor
of the libellant for $150 damages, and $32.33 as one-half of the libellant’s
costs, less $47.06 as one-half of the claimant’s costs, making
the total award to the libellant $135.27. The opinion of the District
Judge is reported in 24 Fed. Rep. 860. It appeared from that that
the judge charged to the libellant’s own fault all his pain and suffering
and all mere consequential damages, and charged the vessel with his
wages, at $2 per day, for seventy-five working days, making $150.</p>

<p class='c007'>The claimant appealed to the Circuit Court, on the ground that the
libel should have been dismissed. It was stipulated between the parties
that the facts as stated in the opinion of the District Judge should
be taken as the facts proved in the case, and that the appeal should be
heard on those facts. Judge Wallace, who heard the case on appeal
in the Circuit Court, delivered an opinion, in August, 1886, which is
reported in 28 Fed. Rep. 881, affirming the decree of the District
Court. No decree was made on that decision, but the case came up
again in the Circuit Court on the 14th of March, 1887, the Court being
held by Mr. Justice Blatchford and Judge Wallace, when a certificate
was signed by them stating as follows: “The libellant was a longshoreman,
a resident of the city and county of New York, and was,
at the time when the said accident occurred, employed as longshoreman,
by the hour, by the stevedore having the contract to load coal
on board the steamship Max Morris. The injuries to the libellant
were occasioned by his falling through an unguarded opening in the
rail on the after-end of the lower bridge. The Max Morris was a
British steamship, hailing from Liverpool, England. The defendant
contends, as a matter of defence to said libel, that the injuries complained
of by libellant were caused by his own negligence. The libellant
contends that the injuries were occasioned entirely through the
fault of the vessel and her officers. The Court finds, as a matter of
fact, that the injuries to the libellant were occasioned partly through
his own negligence and partly through the negligence of the officers
of the vessel. It now occurs, as a question of law, whether the libellant,
under the above facts, is entitled to a decree for divided damages.
On this question the opinions of the judges are in conflict.” On
motion of the claimant, the question in difference was certified to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Court, and a decree was entered by the Circuit Court affirming the
decree of the District Court and awarding to the libellant a recovery
of $135.27, with interest from the date of the decree of the District
Court, and $26.30 as the libellant’s costs in the Circuit Court, making
a total of $172. From that decree the claimant has appealed to this
Court. Rev. Stat. §§ 652, 693; Dow <em>v.</em> Johnson, 100 U. S. 158.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mr. Justice Blatchford</span>, after stating the case as above reported,
delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question discussed in the opinions of Judge Brown and Judge
Wallace, and presented to us for decision, is whether the libellant was
debarred from the recovery of any sum of money, by reason of the
fact that his own negligence contributed to the accident, although
there was negligence also in the officers of the vessel. The question
presented by the certificate is really that question, although stated
in the certificate to be whether the libellant, under the facts presented,
was entitled to a decree “for divided damages.” It appears from
the opinion of the District Judge that he imposed upon the claimant
“some part of the damage” which his concurrent negligence occasioned,
while it does not appear from the record that the award of the
$150 was the result of an equal division of the damages suffered by
the libellant, or a giving to him of exactly one-half, or of more or less
than one-half, of such damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The particular question before us has never been authoritatively
passed upon by this Court, and is, as stated by the District Judge in
his opinion, whether, in a Court of admiralty, in a case like the present,
where personal injuries to the libellant arose from his negligence
concurring with that of the vessel, any damages can be awarded, or
whether the libel must be dismissed, according to the rule in common-law
cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine of an equal division of damages in admiralty, in the
case of a collision between two vessels, where both are guilty of fault
contributing to the collision, had long been the rule in England, but
was first established by this Court in the case of The Schooner Catherine
<em>v.</em> Dickinson, 17 How. 170, and has been applied by it to cases
where, both vessels being in fault, only one of them was injured, as
well as to cases where both were injured, the injured vessel, in the first
case, recovering only one-half of its damages, and, in the second case,
the damages suffered by the two vessels being added together and
equally divided, and the vessel whose damages exceeded such one-half
recovering the excess against the other vessel. In the case of The
Schooner Catherine <em>v.</em> Dickinson, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, both vessels being held in
fault for the collision, it was said by the Court, speaking by Mr. Justice
Nelson, p. 177, that the well-settled rule in the English admiralty
was “to divide the loss,” and that “under the circumstances usually
attending these disasters” the Court thought “the rule dividing the
loss the most just and equitable, and as best tending to induce care and
vigilance on both sides, in the navigation.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>[In Atlee <em>v.</em> Packet Co., 21 Wallace, 389, p. 395, <span class='sc'>Miller, J.</span>, said:]
“But the plaintiff has elected to bring his suit in an admiralty Court,
which has jurisdiction of the case, notwithstanding the concurrent
right to sue at law. In this Court the course of proceeding is in many
respects different and the rules of decision are different. The mode
of pleading is different, the proceeding more summary and informal,
and neither party has a right to trial by jury. An important difference
as regards this case is the rule for estimating the damages. In
the common-law Court the defendant must pay all the damages or
none. If there has been on the part of the plaintiffs such carelessness
or want of skill as the common law would esteem to be contributory
negligence, they can recover nothing. By the rule of the admiralty
Court, where there has been such contributory negligence, or, in other
words, when both have been in fault, the entire damages resulting
from the collision must be equally divided between the parties. This
rule of the admiralty commends itself quite as favorably in its influence
in securing practical justice as the other; and the plaintiff
who has the selection of the forum in which he will litigate cannot
complain of the rule of that forum.” This Court, therefore, treated
the case as if it had been one of a collision between two vessels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the cases referred to show that this Court has extended the
rule of the division of damages to claims other than those for damages
to the vessels which were in fault in a collision.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The rule of the equal apportionment of the loss where both parties
were in fault would seem to have been founded upon the difficulty of
determining, in such cases, the degree of negligence in the one and
the other. It is said by Cleirac (<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Us et Coutumes de la Mer</span></cite>, p. 68) that
such rule of division is a rustic sort of determination, and such as
arbiters and amicable compromisers of disputes commonly follow,
where they cannot discover the motives of the parties, or when they
see faults on both sides.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the particular question now presented for decision, there has
been a conflict of opinion in the lower Courts of the United States.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>All these were cases in admiralty, and were not cases of collision
between two vessels. They show an amelioration of the common-law
rule, and an extension of the admiralty rule in a direction which we
think is manifestly just and proper. Contributory negligence, in a
case like the present, should not wholly bar recovery. There would
have been no injury to the libellant but for the fault of the vessel;
and while, on the one hand, the Court ought not to give him full compensation
for his injury, where he himself was partly in fault, it ought
not, on the other hand, to be restrained from saying that the fact of
his negligence should not deprive him of all recovery of damages. As
stated by the District Judge in his opinion in the present case, the
more equal distribution of justice, the dictates of humanity, the safety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>of life and limb and the public good, will be best promoted by holding
vessels liable to bear some part of the actual pecuniary loss sustained
by the libellant, in a case like the present, where their fault is clear,
provided the libellant’s fault, though evident, is neither wilful, nor
gross, nor inexcusable, and where the other circumstances present a
strong case for his relief. We think this rule is applicable to all like
cases of marine tort founded upon negligence and prosecuted in admiralty,
as in harmony with the rule for the division of damages in
cases of collision. The mere fact of the negligence of the libellant as
partly occasioning the injuries to him, when they also occurred partly
through the negligence of the officers of the vessel, does not debar him
entirely from a recovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The necessary conclusion is, that the question whether the libellant,
upon the facts found, is entitled to a decree for divided damages, must
be answered in the affirmative, in accordance with the judgment
below. This being the only question certified, and the amount in dispute
being insufficient to give this Court jurisdiction of the whole
case, our jurisdiction is limited to reviewing this question. Chicago
Union Bank <em>v.</em> Kansas City Bank, 136 U. S. 223. Whether, in a case
like this, the decree should be for exactly one-half of the damages sustained,
or might, in the discretion of the Court, be for a greater or less
proportion of such damages, is a question not presented for our
determination upon this record, and we express no opinion upon it.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>BUTTERFIELD <em>v.</em> FORRESTER<br /> <span class='sc'>In the King’s Bench, April 22, 1809.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 11 East, 60.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>This was an action on the case for obstructing a highway, by means
of which obstruction the plaintiff, who was riding along the road, was
thrown down with his horse, and injured, &amp;c. At the trial before
Bayley, J., at Derby, it appeared that the defendant, for the purpose
of making some repairs to his house, which was close by the roadside
at one end of the town, had put up a pole across this part of the road,
a free passage being left by another branch or street in the same direction.
That the plaintiff left a public house not far distant from
the place in question at 8 o’clock in the evening in August, when they
were just beginning to light candles, but while there was light enough
left to discern the obstruction at one hundred yards distance; and the
witness who proved this, said that if the plaintiff had not been riding
very hard he might have observed and avoided it; the plaintiff, however,
who was riding violently, did not observe it, but rode against it,
and fell with his horse and was much hurt in consequence of the accident;
and there was no evidence of his being intoxicated at the time.
On this evidence Bayley, J., directed the jury, that if a person riding
with reasonable and ordinary care could have seen and avoided the obstruction;
and if they were satisfied that the plaintiff was riding along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>the street extremely hard, and without ordinary care, they should find
a verdict for the defendant, which they accordingly did.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Vaughan</em>, Serjt., now objected to this direction, on moving for a new
trial; and referred to Buller’s Ni. Pri. 26,<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c015'><sup>[189]</sup></a> where the rule is laid down,
that “if a man lay logs of wood across a highway, though a person
may with care ride safely by, yet if by means thereof my horse stumble
and fling me, I may bring an action.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bayley, J.</span> The plaintiff was proved to be riding as fast as his
horse could go, and this was through the streets of Derby. If he had
used ordinary care he must have seen the obstruction; so that the
accident appeared to happen entirely from his own fault.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Ellenborough, C. J.</span> A party is not to cast himself upon an
obstruction which had been made by the fault of another, and avail
himself of it, if he do not himself use common and ordinary caution
to be in the right. In cases of persons riding upon what is considered
to be the wrong side of the road, that would not authorize another
purposely to ride up against them. One person being in fault will not
dispense with another’s using ordinary care for himself. Two things
must concur to support this action: an obstruction in the road by the
fault of the defendant, and no want of ordinary care to avoid it on the
part of the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c014'>Case for negligence. The declaration stated, that the plaintiff
theretofore, and at the time of the committing of the grievance thereinafter
mentioned, to wit, on, &amp;c., was lawfully possessed of a certain
donkey, which said donkey of the plaintiff was then lawfully in a certain
highway, and the defendant was then possessed of a certain wagon
and of certain horses drawing the same, which said wagon and horses
of the defendant were then under the care, government, and direction
of a certain then servant of the defendant, in and along the said highway;
nevertheless the defendant, by his said servant, so carelessly,
negligently, unskilfully, and improperly governed and directed his
said wagon and horses, that by and through the carelessness, negligence,
unskilfulness, and improper conduct of the defendant, by his
said servant, the said wagon and horses of the defendant then ran and
struck with great violence against the said donkey of the plaintiff, and
thereby then wounded, crushed, and killed the same, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial, before Erskine, J., at the last Summer Assizes for the
county of Worcester, it appeared that the plaintiff, having fettered the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>fore-feet of an ass belonging to him, turned it into a public highway,
and at the time in question the ass was grazing on the off side of a
road about eight yards wide, when the defendant’s wagon, with a team
of three horses, coming down a slight descent, at what the witness
termed a smartish pace, ran against the ass, knocked it down, and the
wheels passing over it, it died soon after. The ass was fettered at
the time, and it was proved that the driver of the wagon was some
little distance behind the horses. The learned judge told the jury,
that though the act of the plaintiff, in leaving the donkey on the highway
so fettered as to prevent his getting out of the way of carriages
travelling along it, might be illegal, still, if the proximate cause of
the injury was attributable to the want of proper conduct on the part
of the driver of the wagon, the action was maintainable against the
defendant; and his Lordship directed them, if they thought that the
accident might have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary care on
the part of the driver, to find for the plaintiff. The jury found their
verdict for the plaintiff, damages 40<em>s.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><em>Godson</em> now moved for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection.
The act of the plaintiff in turning the donkey into the public highway
was an illegal one, and, as the injury arose principally from that act,
the plaintiff was not entitled to compensation for that injury which,
but for his own unlawful act, would never have occurred. [<span class='sc'>Parke, B.</span>
The declaration states that the ass was lawfully on the highway, and
the defendant has not traversed that allegation; therefore it must be
taken to be admitted.] The principle of law, as deducible from the
cases is, that where an accident is the result of faults on both sides,
neither party can maintain an action. Thus, in Butterfield <em>v.</em> Forrester,
11 East, 60, it was held that one who is injured by an obstruction
on a highway, against which he fell, cannot maintain an action, if it
appear that he was riding with great violence and want of ordinary
care, without which he might have seen and avoided the obstruction.
So, in Vennall <em>v.</em> Garner, 1 C. &amp; M. 21, in case for running down a
ship, it was held, that neither party can recover when both are in the
wrong; and Bayley, B., there says, “I quite agree that if the mischief
be the result of the combined negligence of the two, they must
both remain in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">statu quo</span></i>, and neither party can recover against the
other.” Here the plaintiff, by fettering the donkey, had prevented
him from removing himself out of the way of accident; had his fore-feet
been free no accident would probably have happened. Pluckwell
<em>v.</em> Wilson, 5 Car. &amp; P. 375; Luxford <em>v.</em> Large, Ibid. 421, and Lynch
<em>v.</em> Nurdin, 1 Ad. &amp; E. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 29<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c015'><sup>[190]</sup></a>; 4 P. &amp; D. 672, are to the same
effect.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Abinger, C. B.</span> I am of opinion that there ought to be no
rule in this case. The defendant has not denied that the ass was lawfully
in the highway, and therefore we must assume it to have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>lawfully there; but even were it otherwise, it would have made no difference,
for as the defendant might, by proper care, have avoided injuring
the animal, and did not, he is liable for the consequences of his
negligence, though the animal may have been improperly there.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Parke, B.</span> This subject was fully considered by this Court in the
case of Bridge <em>v.</em> The Grand Junction Railway Company, 3 M. &amp; W.
246, where, as appears to me, the correct rule is laid down concerning
negligence, namely, that the negligence which is to preclude a plaintiff
from recovering in an action of this nature, must be such as that
he could, by ordinary care, have avoided the consequences of the defendant’s
negligence. I am reported to have said in that case, and I
believe quite correctly, that “the rule of law is laid down with perfect
correctness in the case of Butterfield <em>v.</em> Forrester, that, although there
may have been negligence on the part of the plaintiff, yet unless he
might, by the exercise of ordinary care, have avoided the consequences
of the defendant’s negligence, he is entitled to recover; if by ordinary
care he might have avoided them, he is the author of his own wrong.”
In that case of Bridge <em>v.</em> Grand Junction Railway Company, there
was a plea imputing negligence on both sides; here it is otherwise;
and the judge simply told the jury, that the mere fact of negligence
on the part of the plaintiff in leaving his donkey on the public highway,
was no answer to the action, unless the donkey’s being there was
the immediate cause of the injury; and that, if they were of opinion
that it was caused by the fault of the defendant’s servant in driving
too fast or, which is the same thing, at a smartish pace, the mere fact
of putting the ass upon the road would not bar the plaintiff of his
action. All that is perfectly correct; for, although the ass may have
been wrongfully there, still the defendant was bound to go along the
road at such a pace as would be likely to prevent mischief. Were this
not so, a man might justify the driving over goods left on a public
highway, or even over a man lying asleep there, or the purposely
running against a carriage going on the wrong side of the road.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Gilbert, J.</span><a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c015'><sup>[192]</sup></a>&#160;... The defendant in error was a miner of the age of 34
years, and was in the full possession of his senses. According to his own testimony,
he walked upon the railroad track a distance of more than half a mile
without once looking back or stopping to listen for an approaching train. In so
doing, it must be held that he was guilty of gross negligence, which, irrespective
of negligence in the failure of the engineer to discover him on the track, is
sufficient to bar his right of recovery. It was no excuse for his failure to take
such precautions that the wind was blowing in his face, or that the noise of a
waterfall may have deadened the sound of an approaching train. Those circumstances
only rendered the use of his senses the more imperative. It was
his duty continually to exercise vigilance.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>On the authority of Inland &amp; Seaboard Coasting Co. <em>v.</em> Tolson, 139 U. S.
551–558, 11 Sup. Ct. 653, 35 L. Ed. 270; Grand Trunk Ry. Co. <em>v.</em> Ives, 144
U. S. 408–429, 12 Sup. Ct. 679, 36 L. Ed. 485; and Bogan <em>v.</em> Carolina Central
Ry. Co., 129 N. C. 154, 39 S. E. 808, 55 L. R. A. 418, the defendant in error
invokes the doctrine that the contributory negligence of the party injured will
not defeat the action, if it be shown that the defendant might, by the exercise
of reasonable care and prudence, have avoided the consequences of the injured
party’s negligence. In the first of these decisions, the doctrine was applied in
a case where the plaintiff, a wharfinger, was standing with his foot between the
timbers of a wharf, to deliver freight to a vessel which was about to make a
landing there, and which struck the wharf with such force as to crush his foot.
But the court held that the doctrine was applicable, for the reason that the
jury might well have been of opinion that, while there was some negligence on
the plaintiff’s part in standing where and as he did, yet the officers of the boat
knew just where and how he stood, and might have avoided injuring him, if
they had used reasonable care to prevent the steamboat from striking the
wharf with unusual and unnecessary violence. In the Ives Case, the plaintiff’s
intestate was killed while attempting to cross a railroad track. There was
evidence of negligence on the part of the railroad company. On the part of the
plaintiff’s intestate there was no evidence as to what precaution he took before
placing himself in the place of danger, except that, at a distance of about
seventy-six feet from the track, he stopped several minutes, presumably to
listen for trains; that while there a train passed; and that, soon after it had
passed, and while the noise caused by it was still quite distinct, he proceeded
across the track and was struck by another train. The court held that the
question of contributory negligence of the plaintiff’s intestate was properly
left to the jury, as one to be determined under all the circumstances of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>case, but incidentally proceeded to affirm the rule above quoted, citing Davies
<em>v.</em> Mann, 10 M. &amp; W. 546; Inland &amp; Seaboard Coasting Co. <em>v.</em> Tolson, and
other cases. There was no evidence in the Ives Case that the plaintiff’s intestate
was seen by those who were managing the train in time to have avoided
the accident. The court, in that case, however, reaffirmed the rule that a
traveller, on going upon a railroad track, ought to make vigilant use of his
senses of sight and hearing, and listen for signals, and look in the different
directions from which a train might come, and said:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“If by neglect of this duty he suffers injury from a passing train, he cannot
recover of the company, although it may itself be chargeable with negligence,
or have failed to give the signals required by statute, or be running at the time
at a speed exceeding the legal rate.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It cannot be contended that in the Ives Case the Supreme Court intended to
lay down the broad rule that no contributory negligence of the party injured
will defeat his right to recover, if it be shown that the defendant might, by the
exercise of reasonable care and prudence, have avoided the consequences of
that negligence. To so hold would be to destroy the whole doctrine of contributory
negligence. As applied to the present case, it would mean that the
plaintiff in error was bound to know that the defendant in error was upon its
track, and that he would not step aside in time to avoid the train. Such is not
the doctrine of cases such as Northern Pacific Railroad <em>v.</em> Freeman<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c015'><sup>[193]</sup></a> and the
other decisions which we have cited above. The doctrine of “the last clear
chance,” so invoked by the defendant in error, originated in Davies <em>v.</em> Mann,
in which it was held that the plaintiff’s want of ordinary care in that case did
not constitute contributory negligence, because it was a remote cause or mere
condition of the injury, and did not proximately contribute to it, and because
the negligence of the defendant arose subsequently to that of the plaintiff, and
the latter’s negligence was so obvious as to have been discoverable by the
exercise of ordinary care. That doctrine has no application to a case where the
plaintiff voluntarily places himself in a place of danger from which he has
present means of escape, and continues there without exercising precautions
which an ordinarily prudent man would exercise. We have nothing here to do
with the law applicable to a case where the injured person is found in a place of
danger, as upon a railroad trestle, from which he is powerless to extricate himself
on the approach of a train, and where his situation is discovered, or ought
to have been discovered, by those in charge of the train.</p>

<p class='c022'>Action under statute by administrator of Susan V. Jones to recover for her
death. Mrs. Jones was killed by a train backing down upon her while she was
walking on the railroad track. Plaintiff’s evidence tended to show that the
track at that place had been accustomed to be used by the public as a walkway
with the knowledge and acquiescence of the defendant company. Mrs. Jones,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>when killed, was on a trestle. The train was backing down behind her, at a
speed of from five to ten miles an hour. There was evidence on plaintiff’s part
that no bell was rung, no whistle blown, no warning given of the approach of
the train; also that there was no lookout on the train, and no rear-end lights.</p>

<p class='c019'>Defendant requested the following instruction (No. 6):—</p>

<p class='c019'>“Even if the defendant was guilty of negligence in the backing of its train,
and such negligence was a proximate cause of the injury, if the jury also believe
that the said Susan V. Jones showed a want of ordinary care in walking
down the track that night, under all the circumstances, and such carelessness
was a proximate cause of the injury, she was guilty of contributory negligence,
and the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The judge qualified this instruction by adding:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“If the deceased, Mrs. Jones, was guilty of negligence in acting as you may
find from the testimony that she acted, and if her conduct, her negligence, together
with the negligence of the railroad company, contributed to her injury
as the proximate cause, then the railroad company would not be responsible,
unless the railroad company could have avoided injuring her notwithstanding
her negligence.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The judge charged the jury, in accordance with plaintiff’s ninth request, as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“Contributory negligence is a matter of defence, and must be proved by
defendant by a preponderance of the evidence; but unless the contributory
negligence was the proximate cause of the accident, and if in spite of such contributory
negligence the accident could have been avoided by the use of
ordinary care on the part of the defendant, then plaintiff is still entitled to
recover.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Verdict for plaintiff and judgment thereon. Defendant appealed.<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c015'><sup>[194]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Jones, J.</span>... The testimony being undisputed that Mrs. Jones, plaintiff’s
intestate, was walking down the railroad track at the time of the injury, the
defendant was entitled to have the sixth request to charge above mentioned in
the tenth exception submitted to the jury as entirely correct. The remarks by
the court down to the clause, “unless the railroad company could have
avoided injuring her notwithstanding her negligence,” were not improper nor
inconsistent with the request, but the addition of such qualification was erroneous
and wholly inconsistent with the well-settled principles governing contributory
negligence. The same error was made in the charge excepted to in
the eleventh exception above, when the court instructed the jury, “but unless
the contributory negligence was the proximate cause of the accident, and if in
spite of <em>such</em> contributory negligence (that is, negligence which contributed as
a proximate cause), the accident could have been avoided by the use of ordinary
care on the part of the defendant, then the plaintiff is still entitled to
recover.” The charge destroyed the defence of contributory negligence. In
<em>every</em> case where there is contributory negligence the defendant could have
avoided the injury by ordinary care, for the simple reason that there can be no
such thing as contributory negligence unless the defendant be negligent. The
error complained of is the same error which was condemned in Cooper <em>v.</em> Ry.
Co., 56 S. C. 94. The law in this state is settled that contributory negligence
as defined in Cooper’s case, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, to <em>any</em> extent, will <em>always</em> defeat plaintiff’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>recovery, unless the injury is wantonly or wilfully inflicted; for the law cannot
measure how much of the injury is due to the plaintiff’s own fault, and will
not recompense one for injury resulting to himself from his own misconduct.
The objection to the charge is that it instructed the jury that although plaintiff’s
negligence contributed to her injury as a proximate cause, she could recover
if the defendant by ordinary care could have avoided the injury. Is it
not manifest that such a rule would abolish contributory negligence as a defence?
The qualifying terms, “unless the railroad company could have
avoided injuring her notwithstanding her negligence,” would necessarily mislead
a jury; for they would at once say the railroad company could have
avoided the injury by not being negligent in the manner alleged in the complaint,
by having suitable rear end lights, by a reasonable lookout, by loud
warning of the train’s approach, by running at such slow speed as to enable
any one warned to get off the track; and then utterly ignore the defendant’s
plea and evidence of contributory negligence, because of the instruction that
plaintiff, notwithstanding her negligence which proximately caused her injury,
could still recover, if the defendant could have avoided the injury. The
jury ought to have been instructed without qualification, that if plaintiff was
negligent and that negligence contributed as a proximate cause to her injury,
she could not recover, unless the injury was wantonly or wilfully inflicted.</p>

<p class='c019'>The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the case remanded for a
new trial.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>CORDINER <em>v.</em> LOS ANGELES TRACTION COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>District Court of Appeals, Second District, California, April 16, 1907.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 4 California Appellate Decisions, 480.</em></h5>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Shaw, J.</span> Neither of the defendants questioned the right of plaintiff to recover
such damages as she had sustained in the collision, but each contended
that the other should be held responsible therefor; and with the view of having
the jury pass upon the question, the Los Angeles Railway Company asked
the court to instruct the jury, in effect, that notwithstanding the negligence of
its motorman in driving his car upon the crossing, still if the traction motorman
could, after he saw that it was beyond the power of the motorman of the
Los Angeles Railway car to avoid the accident, have, by proper care, prevented
the collision, then the negligence of the defendant Los Angeles Traction
Company was the proximate cause of the injury. In other words, while admitting
that plaintiff’s injury resulted from the collision due to the joint or concurrent
acts of negligence of defendants, she must be confined in her recovery
for such damages to a judgment rendered against the defendant who had
the “last clear chance” to avoid the collision and neglected to act upon it.
Appellant seeks to apply the well-established principle that “he who last has
a clear opportunity of avoiding the accident, by the exercise of proper care to
avoid injuring another, must do so.” Esrey <em>v.</em> S. Pacific Co., 103 Cal. 541.
This rule is only applicable to cases where the defence is based upon the contributory
negligence of plaintiff due to his want of care in placing himself in a
position of danger, and where he may, notwithstanding his negligence, recover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>from a defendant, who by the exercise of proper care could have avoided the
injury. We are unable to perceive why this rule should apply to plaintiff,
who was in no way chargeable, by imputation or otherwise, with negligence;
nor are we referred to any authority which supports the proposition. Indeed,
all the authorities recognize the right of recovery against either or both of the
defendants whose concurring acts of negligence united in producing the injury.

<p class='c007'>Error to the Court of Common Pleas of York County.</p>

<p class='c007'>Action on the case by Jacob B. Geesey against Thomas Stiles, for
alleged injury by the negligence of William Stiles, son of defendant,
by which plaintiff’s horse and carriage were damaged.<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c015'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Plaintiff’s wife, driving in a light carriage of plaintiff’s, hitched her
horse to a tree on the road, and went into a friend’s house. The carriage
projected into the travelled part of the road. Whilst the carriage
was so left, the defendant’s son, William Stiles, was driving his father’s
team with a loaded wagon along the road. He got off to do something
to his wagon; and seeing an acquaintance in a neighboring barn,
stopped a moment to exchange a few words with him, the team moving
on slowly at the time with the load up the hill, keeping the travelled
track of the road till the front horse was just behind plaintiff’s carriage
standing unattended where it was left. At this point of time William
Stiles was behind his own wagon, at some distance from it; and did
not see the obstruction in the road in time to avoid a collision. The
wagon collided with the carriage. Stiles halloed “Whoa,” and his
horses stopped. In the collision, the plaintiff’s horse was fatally
injured.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third point of the plaintiff, which was affirmed in the charge to
the jury by Fisher, P. J., is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“That Thomas Stiles cannot excuse the negligence of William Stiles
by showing that the plaintiff’s property was placed where it received
the injury by want of ordinary care by Mrs. Geesey, if, in the opinion
of the jury such want is imputable to her, should the jury believe that
William Stiles was chargeable with negligence in leaving his team and
permitting it to go along the highway unattended.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span><span class='sc'>Read, J.</span> [After stating the facts.] We have taken in brief, the defendant’s
statement of his defence, which fairly raises the question of
contributory negligence. “It is an incontestable principle that where
the injury complained of is the product of mutual or concurring negligence,
no action for damages will lie. The parties being mutually in
fault there can be no apportionment of the damages. The law has no
scales to determine in such cases whose wrong-doing weighed most in
the compound that occasioned the mischief:” per Woodward, J.,
12 Harris, 469.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The question presented to the Court or the jury is never one of
comparative negligence, as between the parties; nor does very great
negligence on the part of a defendant so operate to strike a balance
of negligence as to give a judgment to a plaintiff whose own negligence
contributes in any degree to the injury.” Wilds <em>v.</em> Hudson River
Railroad Co., 24 N. Y. 432.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third error assigned is that the Court erred in their charge to
the jury on the plaintiff’s third point, which was as follows: “That
Thomas Stiles cannot excuse the negligence of William Stiles by showing
that the plaintiff’s property was placed where it received the injury,
by want of ordinary care by Mrs. Geesey, if in the opinion of the
jury such want is imputable to her, should the jury believe William
Stiles was chargeable with negligence, in leaving his team and permitting
it to go along the highway unattended,” which point the
Court affirmed, holding that although there was contributory negligence
on the part of the plaintiff, he was entitled to recover from the
defendant on account of his negligence. This was a binding instruction
upon the jury, leaving nothing for them to inquire into practically,
except the negligence of the defendant. In this the Court
committed a clear error, and the judgment must be reversed, and

<h5 class='c013'>RADLEY <em>v.</em> LONDON AND NORTH WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>In the House of Lords, December 1, 1876.</span><br /> <em>Reported in Law Reports, 1 Appeal Cases, 754.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>This was an appeal against a decision of the Court of Exchequer
Chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appellants were the plaintiffs in an action brought in the Court
of Exchequer, in which they claimed to recover damages for the destruction
of a bridge occasioned, as they alleged, by the negligence
of the defendants’ servants. The plaintiffs were owners of the Sankey
Brook Colliery, in the county of Lancaster, which was situated
near a branch line of the defendants’ railway. There was a siding
belonging to the plaintiffs, which communicated with the railway, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the defendants’ servants were in the habit of taking trucks loaded
with coals from this siding, in order to run them on the railway to
forward them to their destination, and also of bringing back empty
trucks and running them from the railway on to the siding. On
Saturday after working hours, when all the colliery men had gone
away, the defendants’ servants ran some of the plaintiffs’ empty
trucks from the railway upon the siding and there left them. In that
position they remained. One of the watchmen employed by the plaintiffs
knew that they were there, but nothing was done to remove them
to a different place. In the first of these trucks had been placed a
truck which had broken down, and the height of the two trucks combined
was nearly eleven feet. There was, in advance of the spot where
the trucks had been left, a bridge placed over a part of the siding, the
span of which bridge was about eight feet from the ground. On Sunday
afternoon the defendants’ servants brought a long line of empty
trucks belonging to the plaintiffs, and ran them on the line of the siding,
pushing on the first set of trucks in front. Some resistance was
perceived, and the pushing force of the engine employed was increased,
and the result was, as the two trucks at the head of the line could not
pass under the bridge, they struck with great force against it and
broke it down.<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c015'><sup>[197]</sup></a> For the damage thereby occasioned this action was
brought. The defence was contributory negligence; it being insisted
that the plaintiffs ought to have moved the first set of trucks to a safe
place, or at all events, not to have left the truck with the disabled
truck in it so as to be likely to occasion mischief. At the trial before
Mr. Justice Brett, at the Summer Assizes at Liverpool, in 1873, the
learned judge told the jury that “you must be satisfied that the plaintiffs’
servants did not do anything which persons of ordinary care,
under the circumstances, would not do, or that they omitted to do
something which persons of ordinary care would do.... It is for
you to say entirely as to both points; but the law is this, the plaintiffs
must have satisfied you that this happened by the negligence of the
defendants’ servants, and without any contributory negligence of their
own, in other words that it was solely by the negligence of the defendants’
servants. If you think it was, then your verdict will be for
the plaintiffs. If you think it was not solely by the negligence of the
defendants’ servants, your verdict must be for the defendants.”<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c015'><sup>[198]</sup></a> The
jurors having, on this direction, stated that they thought there was
contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs, the learned judge
directed that the verdict should be entered for the defendants, but
reserved leave for the plaintiffs to move.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>A rule having been obtained for a new trial, it was after argument
before Barons Bramwell and Amphlett made absolute.<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c015'><sup>[199]</sup></a> On appeal
to the Exchequer Chamber the decision was, by Justices Blackburn,
Mellor, Lush, Brett, and Archibald (<em>diss.</em> Justice Denman), reversed.<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c015'><sup>[200]</sup></a>
This appeal was then brought.<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c015'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Penzance.</span> My Lords, the action out of which this appeal
arises is an action charging the defendants with negligence (through
their servants) in so managing the shunting of some empty coal-wagons
as to knock down a bridge and some staging and some colliery
head-gearing, which stood upon it, and belonged to the plaintiffs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first question on the appeal is, whether the Court of Exchequer
Chamber was right in holding that there was any evidence, proper to
be submitted to the jury, tending to the conclusion that the plaintiffs
themselves had been guilty of some negligence in the matter, and that
such negligence had contributed to produce the accident and injury of
which they complained.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general facts of the case, the particular facts which gave rise
to the imputation of negligence, and the contention of both sides as
to the fair result of these facts, are stated in the judgment of the
Court of Exchequer delivered by Baron Bramwell. His Lordship here
read the statement from Mr. Baron Bramwell’s judgment.<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c015'><sup>[202]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It may be admitted that this is a fair and full statement of the arguments
and considerations on the one side, and on the other, upon
which the question of the plaintiffs’ negligence had to be decided. But
it had to be decided by the jurors, and not by the Court, and I am
unable to perceive any reason why the learned judge did wrong in
submitting these arguments and considerations to their decision accordingly.
The bare statement of them is enough to show that there
were in the case facts and circumstances sufficient at least to raise the
question of negligence, whether they were a sufficient proof of negligence
or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>The decision, therefore, of the Exchequer Chamber upon this matter
ought, I think, to be upheld.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remaining question is whether the learned judge properly directed
the jury in point of law. The law in these cases of negligence
is, as was said in the Court of Exchequer Chamber, perfectly well
settled and beyond dispute.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first proposition is a general one, to this effect, that the plaintiff
in an action for negligence cannot succeed if it is found by the jury
that he has himself been guilty of any negligence or want of ordinary
care which contributed to cause the accident.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there is another proposition equally well established, and it is a
qualification upon the first, namely, that though the plaintiff may
have been guilty of negligence, and although that negligence may, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>fact, have contributed to the accident, yet if the defendant could in the
result, by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence, have avoided the
mischief which happened, the plaintiffs’ negligence will not excuse
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>This proposition, as one of law, cannot be questioned. It was
decided in the case of Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, 10 M. &amp; W. 546, supported in
that of Tuff <em>v.</em> Warman, 5 C. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 573; 27 L. J. C. P. 322, and
other cases, and has been universally applied in cases of this character
without question.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only point for consideration, therefore, is whether the learned
judge properly presented it to the mind of the jury.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems impossible to say that he did so. At the beginning of his
summing-up he laid down the following as the propositions of law
which governed the case: It is for the plaintiffs to satisfy you that
this accident happened through the negligence of the defendants’
servants, and as between them and the defendants, that it was solely
through the negligence of the defendants’ servants. They must satisfy
you that it was solely by the negligence of the defendants’ servants,
or, in other words, that there was no negligence on the part of their
servants contributing to the accident; so that, if you think that both
sides were negligent, so as to contribute to the accident, then the
plaintiffs cannot recover.</p>

<p class='c007'>This language is perfectly plain and perfectly unqualified, and in
case the jurors thought there was any contributory negligence on the
part of the plaintiffs’ servants, they could not, without disregarding
the direction of the learned judge, have found in the plaintiffs’ favor,
however negligent the defendants had been, or however easily they
might with ordinary care have avoided any accident at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned judge then went on to describe to the jury what it was
that might properly be considered to constitute negligence, first in the
conduct of the defendants, and then in the conduct of the plaintiffs;
and having done this, he again reverted to the governing propositions
of law, as follows: “There seem to be two views. It is for you to say
entirely as to both points. But the law is this, the plaintiff must have
satisfied you that this happened by the negligence of the defendants’
servants, and without any contributory negligence of their own; in
other words, that it was solely by the negligence of the defendants’
servants. If you think it was, then your verdict will be for the plaintiffs.
If you think it was not solely by the negligence of the defendants’
servants, your verdict must be for the defendants.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This, again, is entirely without qualification, and the undoubted
meaning of it is, that if there was any contributory negligence on the
part of the plaintiffs, they could in no case recover. Such a statement
of the law is contrary to the doctrine established in the case of Davies
<em>v.</em> Mann, 10 M. &amp; W. 546, and the other cases above alluded to, and in
no part of the summing-up is that doctrine anywhere to be found.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>The learned counsel were unable to point out any passage addressed
to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that in part of his summing-up the learned judge pointed
attention to the conduct of the engine-driver, in determining to force
his way by violence through the obstruction, as fit to be considered by
the jury on the question of negligence; but he failed to add that if
they thought the engine-driver might at this stage of the matter by
ordinary care have avoided all accident, any previous negligence of
the plaintiffs would not preclude them from recovering.</p>

<p class='c007'>In point of fact the evidence was strong to show that this was the
immediate cause of the accident, and the jury might well think that
ordinal care and diligence on the part of the engine-driver would,
notwithstanding any previous negligence of the plaintiffs in leaving
the loaded-up truck on the line, have made the accident impossible.
This substantial defect of the learned judge’s charge is that that
question was never put to the jury.</p>

<p class='c007'>On this point, therefore, I propose to move that your Lordships
should reverse the decision of the Exchequer Chamber, and direct a
new trial.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Lord Chancellor</span> (Lord Cairns). My Lords, I have had the
advantage of considering the opinion which has just been expressed
to your Lordships in this case by my noble and learned friend, and,
concurring as I do with every word of it, I do not think it is necessary
that I should do more than say that I hope your Lordships will agree
to the motion which he has proposed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Blackburn.</span> My Lords, I agree entirely with the noble Lord
who has first spoken as to what were the proper questions for the jury
in this case, and that they were not decided by the jury. I am inclined
to think that the learned judge did in part of his summing-up
sufficiently ask the proper questions, had they been answered, but
unfortunately he failed to have an answer from the jury to those questions,
it appearing by the case that the only finding was as to the
plaintiffs’ negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>I agree, therefore, in the result that there should be a new trial.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Gordon.</span> My Lords, I entirely concur in the motion which
has been submitted to your Lordships by my noble and learned friend
on the other side of the House. The question is one which has given
rise to some difficulty in the courts of Scotland, but I think that it is
very likely that the opinion which has been expressed in this case will
be regarded as a very useful authority for guiding their decisions.<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c015'><sup>[203]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Case. Demurrer to the declaration.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Carpenter, J.</span> The declaration alleges that by the defendants’
careless management of their engine and cars, the plaintiffs’ horse was
frightened, and caused to run upon and injure Ursula Clapp, who was
without fault; that Clapp brought her action therefor against the
plaintiffs, and recovered judgment for damages, which they paid; that
the defendants had notice of, and were requested to defend, the suit.
The defendants demur. Inasmuch as Clapp could not have recovered
against the plaintiffs unless they were in fault (Brown <em>v.</em> Collins, 53
N. H. 442; Lyons <em>v.</em> Child, 61 N. H. 72), it must be taken that their
negligence co-operated with that of the defendants to produce the injury.
If the plaintiffs were not liable in that action because their
negligence was not, and the defendants’ negligence was, the cause of
the accident, the objection is not now open to the defendants. Littleton
<em>v.</em> Richardson, 34 N. H. 179. In relation to Clapp, both parties
were wrong-doers. She could pursue her remedy against either or
both of them at her election. Burrows <em>v.</em> March Gas Co., L. R. 5 Ex.
67, 71.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of several wrong-doers, who has been compelled to pay the damages
caused by the wrong, has in general no remedy against the others.
He cannot make his own misconduct the ground of an action in his
favor. To this proposition there are, it has been said, so many exceptions,
that it can hardly, with propriety, be called a general rule.
Bailey <em>v.</em> Bussing, 28 Conn. 455. Its application is restricted to cases
where the person seeking redress knew, or is presumed to have known,
that the act for which he has been mulcted in damages was unlawful.
Jacobs <em>v.</em> Pollard, 10 Cush. 287, 289; Coventry <em>v.</em> Barton, 17 Johns.
142. In many instances several parties may be liable in law to the
person injured, while as between themselves some of them are not
wrong-doers at all; and the equity of the guiltless to require the actual
wrong-doer to respond for all the damages, and the equally innocent
to contribute his proportion, is complete. Wooley <em>v.</em> Batte, 2 C. &amp; P.
417; Pearson <em>v.</em> Skelton, 1 M. &amp; W. 504; Betts <em>v.</em> Gibbins, 2 A. &amp; E.
57; Adamson <em>v.</em> Jarvis, 4 Bing. 66; Avery <em>v.</em> Halsey, 14 Pick. 174;
Gray <em>v.</em> Boston Gas Light Co., 114 Mass. 149; Churchill <em>v.</em> Holt, 127
Mass. 165, and 131 Mass. 67; Bailey <em>v.</em> Bussing, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>; Smith <em>v.</em>
Foran, 43 Conn. 244. These cases, instead of being exceptions to the
rule, seem rather not to fall within it. The right of recovery rests in
the one case upon the principle that he who without fault on his part is
injured by another’s wrongful act is entitled to indemnity, and in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>other upon the doctrine of contribution. One of two masters, who is
compelled to pay damages by reason of his servant’s negligence, may
have contribution from the other because he has removed a burden
common to both. They may recover indemnity of the servant, because
as against him they are without fault, and are directly injured by
his misconduct. One who is so far innocent that he can recover for an
injury to his person or property, may also recover whatever sum he, by
reason of his relation to the wrong, has been compelled to pay to a
third person. If the plaintiffs could recover for an injury to their
horse, caused by the accident, they may recover the sum which they
paid to Clapp.</p>

<p class='c007'>The declaration is general. It does not disclose the particulars of
the plaintiffs’ negligence, by reason of which Clapp recovered against
them. Under it, cases differing widely in their facts and legal aspects
may be proved. Among others possible, it may be shown that the
horse was in the charge of the plaintiffs’ servants, who might have prevented
its fright or its running after the fright, or if they could do
neither, that they might nevertheless have avoided the injury to Clapp;
or it may appear that the plaintiffs’ negligence consisted solely in permitting
the horse, whether attended or unattended by their servants,
to be at the place where it was at the time of the fright. The generality
of the declaration does not render it bad in law. Corey <em>v.</em> Bath, 35
N. H. 531. If the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment upon any state
of facts provable under it, the demurrer must be overruled. Whether
the plaintiffs can recover in any case, and if so, in what cases, possible
to be proved under the declaration, are speculative or hypothetical
questions, of which none may, and all cannot, arise. They involve
substantially the whole subject of the law relating to mutual negligence.
The case might properly be discharged without considering
them (Smith <em>v.</em> Cudworth, 24 Pick. 196), and the parties required to
present by the pleadings, or by a verdict, the facts upon which their
rights depend. A brief consideration, however, of the general questions
involved, may, it is thought, facilitate a trial, and save expense
to the parties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ordinary care is such care as persons of average prudence exercise
under like circumstances. Tucker <em>v.</em> Henniker, 41 N. H. 317; Sleeper
<em>v.</em> Sandown, 52 N. H. 244; Aldrich <em>v.</em> Monroe, 60 N. H. 118. Every
one in the conduct of his lawful business is bound to act with this degree
of care, and if he fails to do so is responsible for the consequences.
It follows that a person injured by reason of his want of ordinary care,
or (since the law makes no apportionment between actual wrong-doers)
by the joint operation of his own and another’s negligence, is
remediless. This general rule of law justly applied to the facts determines,
it is believed, the rights of the parties in all actions for negligence.
In its application, the law, as in various other cases, deals with
the immediate cause,—the cause as distinguished from the occasion,—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>looks at the natural and reasonably to be expected effects.

<p class='c007'>Actions for negligence may, for convenience of consideration, be
separated into four classes, namely,—where, upon the occasion of the
injury complained of (1) the plaintiff, (2) the defendant, or (3)
neither party was present, and (4) where both parties were present.
In all of them it may happen that both parties were more or less negligent.
Actions upon the statute of highways are a common example of
the first class. The negligence of the defendant, however great, does
not relieve the plaintiff from the duty of exercising ordinary care.
If, notwithstanding the defective condition of the highway, this degree
of care on the part of the plaintiff would prevent the accident, his
and not the defendant’s negligence, though but for the latter it could
not happen, is, in the eye of the law, its sole cause. Farnum <em>v.</em> Concord,
2 N. H. 394; Butterfield <em>v.</em> Forrester, 11 East, 60. In this class
of cases, an injury which the plaintiff’s negligence contributes to produce
could not happen without it. The not uncommon statement that
the plaintiff cannot recover if his negligence contributes in any degree
to cause the injury, is strictly correct, although the word “contribute”
may be, as Crompton, J., in Tuff <em>v.</em> Warman, 5 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 584,
says it is, “a very unsafe word to use,” and “much too loose.” The
result is the same whether the plaintiff acts with full knowledge of the
danger, or, by reason of a want of proper care, fails to discover it seasonably.
If he is not bound to anticipate, and in advance provide for,
another’s negligence, he may not wilfully or negligently shut his eyes
against its possibility. He is bound to be informed of everything
which ordinary care would disclose to him. He can no more recover
for an injury caused by driving into a dangerous pit, of which he is
ignorant, but of which ordinary care would have informed him, than
for one caused by carelessly driving into a known pit. Norris <em>v.</em>
Litchfield, 35 N. H. 271; Clark <em>v.</em> Barrington, 41 N. H. 44; Tucker
<em>v.</em> Henniker, 41 N. H. 317; Winship <em>v.</em> Enfield, 42 N. H. 213, 214;
Underhill <em>v.</em> Manchester, 45 N. H. 220.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant’s negligence being found or conceded, the remaining
question is, whether the plaintiff, by the exercise of ordinary care,
could have escaped the injury. If he could not, he is free from fault,
and is entitled to recover. If he could, he not only cannot recover for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>his own injury, but is himself liable to the other party, if the latter is
injured; and the case becomes one of the second class, of which Davies
<em>v.</em> Mann, 10 M. &amp; W. 546, is an instance. The defendant is liable
here for the same reason that, as plaintiff, he could not recover,—that
is to say, because ordinary care on his part would have prevented the
injury. The fact that one has carelessly exposed his property in a
dangerous situation does not absolve his neighbors from the obligation
of conducting themselves in regard to it with ordinary care. An injury
which that degree of care would prevent is caused by the want of
it, and not by the owner’s negligence in leaving his property in a
perilous position. A surgeon, called to set a leg carelessly broken, cannot
successfully urge, in answer to a suit for mal-practice, that the
patient’s negligence in breaking his leg caused the crooked or shortened
limb. Lannen <em>v.</em> Albany Gas-light Co., 44 N. Y. 459, 463; Hibbard
<em>v.</em> Thompson, 109 Mass. 286, 289. So far as the question of civil
liability is concerned, there is no distinction, except it may be in the
measure of damages (Fay <em>v.</em> Parker, 53 N. H. 342, Bixby <em>v.</em> Dunlap,
56 N. H. 456), between wilful and negligent wrongs. One who, without
reasonable necessity, kills his neighbor’s ox, found trespassing in
his field, is equally liable whether he does it purposely or carelessly.
Aldrich <em>v.</em> Wright, 53 N. H. 398; McIntire <em>v.</em> Plaisted, 57 N. H. 606;
Cool. Torts, 688–694. Mann would be no more liable for wilfully
shooting the fettered ass which Davies has carelessly left in the public
highway, than he is for the running over it, which, by ordinary care,
he could avoid. The owner’s negligence, in permitting the ox to stray
and in leaving the ass fettered in the street, although without it the
injury would not happen, is no more the cause, in a legal sense, of
the negligent than of the wilful wrong. In each case alike,—as in
that of the broken leg,—it merely affords the wrong-doer an opportunity
to do the mischief. Bartlett <em>v.</em> Boston Gas-light Co., 117 Mass.
533; Clayards <em>v.</em> Dethick, 12 Q. B. 439, 445.</p>

<p class='c007'>Knowledge, or its equivalent, culpable ignorance, and ignorance
without fault of the situation, are circumstances by which, among
others, the requisite measure of vigilance is determined. Griffin <em>v.</em>
Auburn, 58 N. H. 121, 124; Palmer <em>v.</em> Dearing, 93 N. Y. 7; Robinson
<em>v.</em> Cone, 22 Vt. 213. The question of contributory negligence is
not involved. The wrong, if any, is the negligent injury of property
carelessly exposed to danger. The only question is, whether the defendant
could have prevented it by ordinary care. If he could not, he
is without fault, and not liable. If he could, his negligence is, in law,
the sole cause of the injury. Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, 10 M. &amp; W. 546;
Radley <em>v.</em> London, &amp;c. Railway, 1 App. Ca. 754; Mayor of Colchester
<em>v.</em> Brooke, 7 Q. B. 377; Isbell <em>v.</em> N. Y. &amp; N. H. Railroad, 27 Conn.
393; Trow <em>v.</em> Vt. Central Railroad, 24 Vt. 487; Harlan <em>v.</em> St. Louis,
&amp;c. Railroad, 64 Mo. 480; Kerwhacker <em>v.</em> Cleveland, &amp;c. Railroad, 3
Ohio St. 172.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>The law is not affected by the presence or the absence of the parties,
nor by the difficulty of applying it to complicated facts. To
warrant a recovery where both parties are present at the time of the
injury, as well as in other cases, ability on the part of the defendant
must concur with non-ability on the part of the plaintiff to prevent it
by ordinary care. Their duty to exercise this degree of care is equal
and reciprocal; neither is exonerated from his obligation by the present
or previous misconduct of the other. The law no more holds one
responsible for an unavoidable, or justifies an avoidable, injury to the
person of one who carelessly exposes himself to danger, than to his
property, similarly situated in his absence. He who cannot prevent
an injury negligently inflicted upon his person or property by an intelligent
agent, “present and acting at the time” (State <em>v.</em> Railroad,
52 N. H. 528, 557; White <em>v.</em> Winnisimmet Co., 7 Cush. 155, 157;
Robinson <em>v.</em> Cone, 22 Vt. 213), is legally without fault, and it is immaterial
whether his inability results from his absence, previous negligence,
or other cause. On the other hand, his neglect to prevent it, if
he can, is the sole or co-operating cause of the injury. No one can
justly complain of another’s negligence, which, but for his own wrongful
interposition, would be harmless. Parker <em>v.</em> Adams, 12 Met. 415.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cases of this class assume a great variety of aspects. While all are
governed by the fundamental principle, that he only who by ordinary
care can and does not prevent an injury, is responsible in damages, it
is impossible to formulate a rule in language universally applicable.
A statement of the law correct in its application to one state of facts
may be inaccurate when applied to another. Instructions to the jury
proper and sufficient in a case of the first class, would be not only
inappropriate but incorrect in one of the second class. The doctrine
laid down in Tuff <em>v.</em> Warman, 5 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 573, 585, however just
and well suited to the evidence in that case, was held erroneous as
applied to the facts in Murphy <em>v.</em> Deane, 101 Mass. 455, 464–466, and,
as a general proposition, seems indefensible.</p>

<p class='c007'>An accident may result from a hazardous situation caused by the
previous negligence of one or both parties. If, at the time of the
injury, the defendant is unable to remove the danger which his negligence
has created, the case becomes, in substance, one of the first
class; the plaintiff can recover or not, according as, by ordinary care,
he can or cannot protect himself from the natural consequences of the
situation. If the plaintiff, in like manner, is unable to obviate the
danger which his prior negligence has produced, the case becomes,
substantially, one of the second class; he can recover or not, according
as the defendant, by the same degree of care, can or cannot avoid
the natural consequences of such negligence. If due care on the part
of either at the time of the injury would prevent it, the antecedent
negligence of one or both parties is immaterial, except it may be as
one of the circumstances by which the requisite measure of care is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>be determined. In such a case the law deals with their behavior in
the situation in which it finds them at the time the mischief is done,
regardless of their prior misconduct. The latter is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">incuria</span></i>, but not
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">incuria dans locum injuriae</span></i>,—it is the cause of the danger; the
former is the cause of the injury. Metropolitan Railway <em>v.</em> Jackson,
3 App. Ca. 193, 198; Dublin, &amp;c. Railway <em>v.</em> Slattery, 3 App. Ca.
1155, 1166; Davey <em>v.</em> London, &amp;c. Railway, 12 Q. B. Div. 70, 76;
Churchill <em>v.</em> Rosebeck, 15 Conn. 359, 363–365.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a person, who by his carelessness is put in a position perilous to
himself and to others, while in that position does all that a person of
average prudence could, he is guilty of no wrong towards another who
embraces the opportunity negligently to injure him, or who receives
an injury which proper care on his part would prevent. It would
doubtless be esteemed gross carelessness to navigate the Atlantic in a
vessel without a rudder, but if the owner, while sailing his rudderless
ship with ordinary care, is negligently run down by a steamer, the
latter must pay the damages, and can recover none if it is injured.
Dowell <em>v.</em> Steam Navigation Co., 5 E. &amp; B. 195; Haley <em>v.</em> Earle, 30
N. Y. 208; Hoffman <em>v.</em> Union Ferry Co., 47 N. Y. 176. If the vessel,
by reason of its lack of a rudder, runs upon and injures the steamer,
both being in the exercise of ordinary care at the time, the former
must pay the damages. He who by his negligence has produced a dangerous
situation is responsible for an injury resulting from it to one
who is without fault.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, at the time of the injury, each of the parties, or, in the absence
of antecedent negligence, if neither of them could prevent it by ordinary
care, there can be no recovery. The comparatively rare cases of
simultaneous negligence will ordinarily fall under one or the other of
these heads. If the accident results from the combined effect of the
negligence of both parties, that of neither alone being sufficient to produce
it, proof by the plaintiff that due care on the part of the defendant
would have prevented it will not entitle him to recover, because
like care on his own part would have had the same effect. If the misconduct
of each party is an adequate cause of the injury, so that it
would have occurred by reason of either’s negligence without the
co-operating fault of the other, proof by the plaintiff that by due care
he could not have prevented it will not entitle him to recover, because
no more could the defendant have prevented it by like care. Murphy
<em>v.</em> Deane, 101 Mass. 464, 465; Churchill <em>v.</em> Holt, 131 Mass. 67. In
each case alike they are equally in fault. To warrant a recovery, the
plaintiff must establish both propositions, namely, that by ordinary
care he could not, and the defendant could, have prevented the injury.
State <em>v.</em> Railroad, 52 N. H. 528; Bridge <em>v.</em> Grand Junction Railway,
3 M. &amp; W. 244; Dowell <em>v.</em> Steam Navigation Co., 5 E. &amp; B. 195; Tuff

45 N. Y. 194; Cool. Torts, 674, 675, and cases cited.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the comparatively unfrequent cases of the third class, a negligent
plaintiff can seldom, if ever, recover. Where both parties are careless,
they are usually, if not always, equally in fault; ordinary care on
the part of either would prevent the injury. Not being present on the
occasion of the accident, neither can, in general, guard against the
consequences of the other’s negligence. Blyth <em>v.</em> Topham, Cro. Jac.
158; Sybray <em>v.</em> White, 1 M. &amp; W. 435; Williams <em>v.</em> Groucott, 4 B.
&amp; S. 149; Lee <em>v.</em> Riley, 18 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 722; Wilson <em>v.</em> Newberry, L. R.

Mass. 71; Page <em>v.</em> Olcott, 13 N. H. 399.</p>

<p class='c007'>If there are actions for negligence of such a character that the rights
of the parties are not determinable by the application of these principles,
the present case is not one of them. If, notwithstanding the
defendants’ negligence, the plaintiffs, by ordinary care, could have
prevented the fright of the horse, or its running, after the fright, or,
in the absence of ability to do either, if they could have avoided the
running upon and injury to Clapp, their misconduct, and not that of
the defendants, was the cause of the accident, and they cannot recover.
On the other hand, if the plaintiffs’ carelessness consisted solely in
permitting the horse to be where it was at the time, and ordinary care
by the defendants would have prevented its fright, or, if the plaintiffs,
by proof of any state of facts competent to be shown under the declaration,
can make it appear that at the time of the occurrence they
could not, and the defendants could, by such care have prevented the
accident, they are entitled to recover.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Marshall, J.</span>... Instructions three and seven given for the defendant
sharply drew a distinction between the negligence of the defendant and the
contributory negligence of the plaintiff. Those instructions declared the law
to be that the defendant was not liable unless its negligence was the direct
cause of the injury, while the plaintiff was not entitled to recover if his negligence
“but contributes to the injury.” That is, that the defendant was liable
only for direct negligence, while the plaintiff was cut off from recovery if he
was guilty of any negligence, however slight or remote or indirect it may have
been.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>The law is that a defendant is liable if his negligence was the direct and
proximate cause of the injury, unless the plaintiff has also been guilty of such
negligence as directly contributed to the happening of the injury, and the
defendant is not liable no matter how negligent he may have been if the plaintiff’s
negligence has thus contributed to the injury, for the doctrine of comparative
negligence has never obtained in this State. Hurt <em>v.</em> Railroad, 94 Mo.
264. In each instance the negligence and the contributory negligence must be
direct, that is, must have entered into and formed a part of the efficient cause
of the accident. Hoepper <em>v.</em> Hotel Co., 142 Mo. 388; Beach on Contr. Neg. (2
ed.), sec. 24; Matthews <em>v.</em> Toledo, 21 Ohio Cir. Ct. Rep. 69; Dunkman <em>v.</em>

59 Mo. 223.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mere negligence, without any resulting damage, no more bars a plaintiff’s
recovery than it creates a liability against a defendant. Dickson <em>v.</em> Railroad,
124 Mo. 140. Remote negligence which does not become an efficient cause,
neither creates nor bars a liability. Kennedy <em>v.</em> Railroad, 36 Mo. 351; Meyers
<em>v.</em> Railroad, 59 Mo. 223. It is only where the plaintiff’s negligence contributes
directly to his injury that it precludes his recovery therefor, Moore <em>v.</em> Railroad,
126 Mo. 265. And the plaintiff’s contributory negligence must mingle
with the defendant’s negligence as a direct and proximate cause in order to bar
a recovery. Nolan <em>v.</em> Shickle, 69 Mo. 336; Frick <em>v.</em> Railroad, 75 Mo. 542.</p>

<p class='c019'>These instructions were, therefore, erroneous, and as the jury was misdirected
and as the plaintiff had made out a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> case, he was entitled to
have the law properly declared to the jury, and the trial court did right in
granting a new trial.<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c015'><sup>[204]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Carpenter, J., in</span> NIEBOER <em>v.</em> DETROIT ELECTRIC RAILWAY<br /> (1901) <cite>128 Michigan, 486, 491, 492.</cite><a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c015'><sup>[205]</sup></a></h5>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Carpenter, J.</span> “... The law by which it is determined whether or not
the contributory negligence of the plaintiff bars recovery is very uncertain.
The adjudicated cases are by no means harmonious, and there is an irreconcilable
conflict between the principles announced by eminent judges and the
text-book writers. It has been stated that the plaintiff cannot recover if the
injury complained of would not have occurred without his negligence. It has
also been stated that plaintiff’s negligence will not bar his recovery if due care
on the part of the defendant would have prevented the injury. If the first
statement is correct, contributory negligence always prevents a recovery; if
the second statement is correct, contributory negligence never prevents recovery.
The truth is that the first statement can be correctly applied only in
cases of simultaneous negligence, as in the case of an injury to a person while
crossing a railway in consequence of his own and the railway company’s negligence.
The second statement can be correctly applied only in cases of successive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>negligence, as in the famous Donkey Case, of Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, 10 Mees.
&amp; W. 546, where defendant negligently ran into and injured the plaintiff’s donkey,
which plaintiff had negligently permitted to go unattended on the
highway. The test almost universally approved is whether or not plaintiff’s
negligence is the proximate cause of his injury. If it is, he cannot recover; if it
is not, he can. Even this test has been criticised on the ground that the term
‘proximate’ is misleading. I think this criticism just and important. The
word ‘proximate’ is ordinarily used to indicate the relation between defendant’s
negligence and the plaintiff’s injury. As so used, it has not the same
meaning that it has when used to indicate the relation between plaintiff’s
negligence and plaintiff’s injury. To illustrate, suppose in the case of Davies
<em>v.</em> Mann, above referred to, that, as a result of the collision between the cart
and the donkey, a third person had been injured; I think all will agree that the
owner of the donkey, as well as the owner of the cart, would have been liable.
See Lynch <em>v.</em> Nurdin, 1 Q. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 29. And we have already seen that the
negligence of the owner of the donkey was not so related to the collision as to
preclude recovery in a suit by him against the owner of the cart. As used in
relation to contributory negligence, the term ‘proximate’ simply means that
in some way the relation between plaintiff’s negligence and his injury is more
remote than that between defendant’s negligence and the injury.”<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c015'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Action for damage done to plaintiff’s buggy by an electric car which came
up behind it and hit it. Answer: denying that defendant was negligent, and
alleging negligence on plaintiff’s part.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the trial, it appeared that Hardy, plaintiff’s driver, drove upon the
track without looking behind to see if a car was coming.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant requested the following instructions:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) If the jury find from the evidence that the plaintiff, through his agent,
Hardy, and the defendant were both negligent, and that the negligence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>both directly contributed to cause the injury complained of in plaintiff’s
petition, then your verdict should be for the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) If the jury find that the negligence of both plaintiff’s agent and the defendant
combined so as to directly cause the injury complained of by plaintiff,
then your verdict should be for the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>These requests to instruct were refused.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court, among other instructions, charged in substance as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>If you find that the motorman could, by the exercise of ordinary care, have
seen the plaintiff and stopped the car, and that by reason of the failure to stop
the car Hardy’s team was knocked down and injured, it would be such negligence
on the part of the defendant as would entitle the plaintiff to recover,
provided Hardy was free from contributory negligence on his part.</p>

<p class='c007'>If Hardy was on this track driving south, and you find that he was negligent
in being on it as he was, his failure to look or failure to watch to avoid injury,
if he was negligent, would not prevent him from recovering in this suit, if the
motorman, after discovering him in that position, could have, by the use of
reasonable and ordinary care, avoided the injury by stopping the car. [This
was a restatement in concrete form of an abstract proposition already stated in
the charge.]</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Common Pleas Court there was a verdict for plaintiff and judgment
thereon. The Circuit Court reversed the judgment of the Common Pleas.
Plaintiff brought error.<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c015'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Davis, J.</span> Under the issues in this case, evidence was introduced tending to
prove that the plaintiff’s agent was guilty of negligence directly contributing
to the injury to plaintiff’s property. If the driver of the plaintiff’s team, immediately
upon entering Main Street, and without afterwards looking to the
north, as he admits, drove southward upon the track until the car coming from
the north overtook and collided with the buggy, he was negligent; because the
street was open and unobstructed for from two hundred to two hundred and
fifty feet from the point at which he entered upon it, and it was not necessary
for him to go upon the street railway track, and because, the night being dark,
he unnecessarily put himself in a place of obvious danger and continued
therein until the moment of the accident, without looking out for an approaching
car or doing anything whatever to avoid injury, apparently risking his life
and the property of his principal upon the presumption that the defendant’s
employees would make no mistakes nor be guilty of any negligence. If, on the
other hand, he drove along the street until he came to the obstruction and
then turned out upon the track to go around it without again looking, as his
own testimony shows that he did not, and was then almost in the same instant
struck by the car, he was negligent. Upon either hypothesis, assuming that
the defendant was negligent in not keeping a proper lookout, or was otherwise
not exercising ordinary care to prevent collision with persons lawfully on its
track, the plaintiff could not recover, if it should appear in the case that the
negligence of both is contemporaneous and continuing until after the moment
of the accident, because, in such case the negligence of each is a direct cause of
the injury without which it would not have occurred, rendering it impracticable
in all such instances, if not impossible, to apportion the responsibility
and the damages. Suppose, for example, that not only the buggy and horses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>had been injured, but the defendant’s car also, by what standard could the
extent of liability of either party be determined? Timmons <em>v.</em> The Central
Ohio Railroad Co., 6 Ohio St. 105; Village of Conneaut <em>v.</em> Naef, 54 Ohio St.
529, 531. In short, there can be no recovery in such a case unless the whole
doctrine of contributory negligence, a doctrine founded in reason and justice,
should be abolished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under these circumstances, therefore, it was not sufficient to say to the jury
that if they should find that the motorman who had charge of the car which
struck the team, could by the exercise of ordinary care have seen the team and
could have stopped the car and that by reason of the failure to do so the team
was injured, it would be such negligence by the defendant as would entitle the
plaintiff to recover, provided that the plaintiff’s driver was “free from contributory
negligence.” The defendant had the right to have the jury specifically
instructed, as it requested, that if the jury should find from the evidence that
both the plaintiff and the defendant, through their agents, were negligent, and
that the negligence of both combined so as to directly cause the injury complained
of, then the verdict should be for the defendant. The court refused to
so instruct the jury, and the circuit court correctly held that the refusal to so
charge was erroneous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The error in refusing the defendant’s request to charge, was extended and
made much more prejudicial when the court, after giving instructions as to
contributory negligence by the plaintiff in very general terms, proceeded to
impress upon the jury, by repetition and with some emphasis, the doctrine
known as “the last chance.” This doctrine is logically irreconcilable with the
doctrine of contributory negligence, and accordingly it has been vigorously
criticised and warmly defended. Probably, as in many such controversies, the
truth lies in middle ground; but it is certain that the rule is applicable only in
exceptional cases, and the prevalent habit of incorporating it in almost every
charge to the jury in negligence cases, in connection with, and often as a part
of, instructions upon the subject of contributory negligence, is misleading and
dangerous.</p>

<p class='c007'>This confusion seems to arise either from misapprehension of the law or a
want of definite thinking. The doctrine of the “last chance” has been clearly
defined by a well-known text-writer as follows: “Although a person comes
upon the track negligently, yet if the servants of the railway company, <em>after
they see</em> his danger, can avoid injuring him, they are bound to do so. And,
according to the better view with reference to injuries to travellers at highway
crossings—as distinguished from injuries to <em>trespassers</em> and <em>bare licensees</em>
upon railway tracks at places where they have no legal right to be—the servants
of the railway company are bound to keep a vigilant lookout in front of
advancing engines or trains, to the end of discovering persons exposed to danger
on highway crossings; and the railway company will be liable for running
over them if, by maintaining such a lookout and by using reasonable care and
exertion to check or stop its train, it could avoid injury to them.” 2 Thompson,
Negligence, sec. 1629. The italics are the author’s. Now, it must be
apparent upon even a slight analysis of this rule that it can be applied only
in cases where the negligence of the defendant is proximate and that of the
plaintiff remote; for if the plaintiff and the defendant both be negligent and
the negligence of both be concurrent and directly contributing to produce the
accident, then the case is one of contributory negligence pure and simple. But
if the plaintiff’s negligence merely put him in the place of danger and stopped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>there, not actively continuing until the moment of the accident, and the defendant
either knew of his danger, or by the exercise of such diligence as the
law imposes on him would have known it, then, if the plaintiff’s negligence
did not concurrently combine with defendant’s negligence to produce the
injury, the defendant’s negligence is the proximate cause of the injury and
that of the plaintiff is a remote cause. This is all there is of the so-called doctrine
of “the last clear chance.” A good illustration is found in the case of
Railroad Co. <em>v.</em> Kassen, 49 Ohio St. 230. Kassen walked through the rear car
of the train on which he was a passenger to the rear platform, from which he
either stepped off or fell off upon the track, where he lay for about two hours,
when he was run over by another train. It was held that, although Kassen
may have been negligent in going upon the rear platform and stepping or falling
off, yet since the railroad company knew of his peril and had ample time
to remove him or to notify the trainmen on the later train, its negligence in not
doing so was the proximate cause of Kassen’s death and the negligence of
Kassen was remote. In that case the proximate cause and the remote cause
were so clearly distinguishable, and it is so very evident from the opinion and
the syllabus that this distinction was the real ground of the judgment of the
court, that it is somewhat surprising that the doctrine of last chance as stated
in that case should have been so often misinterpreted as a qualification of the
doctrine of contributory negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is clear, then, that the last chance rule should not be given as a hit or miss
rule in every case involving negligence. It should be given with discrimination.
Since the plaintiff can recover only upon the allegations of his petition,
if there is no charge in the petition that the defendant after having notice of
the plaintiff’s peril could have avoided the injury to plaintiff, and there is no
testimony to support such charge, the giving of such a charge would be erroneous.
There is no such allegation in the petition in this case. But further,
there is testimony tending to prove that the plaintiff’s team was driven upon
the street railway track in the night time, ahead of the car, and that it continued
on the track for a distance of two hundred and fifty feet until struck by
the car, without taking any precaution to avoid accident. Assuming that the
defendant was negligent in not seeing the buggy on the track and in not avoiding
the accident, yet the plaintiff’s negligence was continuous and was concurrent
at the very moment of the collision. It proximately contributed to
the collision, for without it the collision would not have occurred. There was
no new act of negligence by the defendant, which was independent of the concurrent
negligence and which made the latter remote. Therefore there was
no place in the case for the doctrine of “the last clear chance.”</p>

<h5 class='c013'><span class='sc'>McLain, J., in</span> FULLER <em>v.</em> ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY<br /> (1911) <cite>100 Mississippi, 705, 716.</cite></h5>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>McLain, J.</span>... The rule is settled beyond controversy or doubt, first
that all that is required of the railroad company as against a trespasser is the
abstention from wanton or willful injury, or that conduct which is characterized
as gross negligence; second, although the injured party may be
guilty of contributory negligence, yet this is no defense if the injury were willfully,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>wantonly, or recklessly done or the party inflicting the injury was guilty
of such conduct as to characterize it as gross; and, third, that the contributory
negligence of the party injured will not defeat the action if it is shown
that the defendant might by the exercise of reasonable care and prudence have
avoided the consequence of the injured party’s negligence. This last principle
is known as the doctrine of the “last clear chance.” The origin of this doctrine
is found in the celebrated case of Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, 10 Mees. &amp; W. 545....
It is impossible to follow this case through its numerous citations in
nearly every jurisdiction subject to Anglo-American jurisprudence. For the
present it will be sufficient to say that the principle therein announced has
met with practically almost universal favor. It has been severely criticised
by some text-writers.... The law as enunciated in that case has come to
stay....</p>

<p class='c019'>An analytical examination of the adjudged cases upon this subject will demonstrate
the correctness of the above analysis, and, in addition, establish the
soundness and technical accuracy announced in Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>. This
case has been criticised most severely&#160;... by courts of high authority, but
these courts have utterly and entirely failed to appreciate the base upon which
the principle is bottomed, and in repudiating the principle do so upon the idea
that Davies <em>v.</em> Mann establishes the much-abused comparative negligence doctrine,
a doctrine repudiated by this court, but established in this state by
Laws 1910, ch. 135, p. 125. (But this statute has no reference to the instant
case because passed subsequent to the injuries complained of.) In order for
the injured party’s negligence to bar recovery, all of the authorities hold that
it must be the proximate cause; otherwise, it is not contributory. Now, when
it is fully understood that the negligence of the injured party must be the
proximate cause in order to bar the remedy (and, as said above, all authorities
everywhere, ancient and modern, so affirm), the principle announced in
Davies <em>v.</em> Mann must, from necessity, be the correct and true rule. If the
proximate and immediate cause of the injury—the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">causa causans</span></i>—is the
controlling and determining factor in ascertaining whether the injured party
has the right to recover or whether the injuring party is not liable, then it must
follow, as night the day, that the party who has the last opportunity to avoid
the injury is the one upon whom the blame shall fall. To express the idea
differently: If the injured party’s negligence be remote, and not proximate,
he can recover against the party who is guilty of negligence proximately contributing
or causing the injury. The North Carolina courts have perhaps
more satisfactorily and more clearly elucidated this question than have any
opinions that have come under the writer’s eye. In Smith <em>v.</em> N. &amp; S. R. R. Co.,
114 N. C. 728, 19 S. E. 863, 923, 25 L. R. A. 287, it is said that the rule in
Davies <em>v.</em> Mann simply furnishes a means for ascertaining whether the plaintiff’s
negligence is a remote or proximate cause of the injury; that, before the
introduction of this rule, any negligence on the part of the plaintiff, which in
any degree contributes to the injury, was judicially treated as the proximate
cause, and constituted contributory negligence which barred recovery. The
same is clearly stated in Nashua Iron &amp; Steel Co. <em>v.</em> W. &amp; N. R. R. Co., 62
N. H. 159, 163, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i> The antecedent negligence of the injured party, having
been thus relegated to the position of a condition or remote cause of the accident,
it cannot be regarded as contributory, since it is well established that
negligence, in order to be contributory, must be at least one of the proximate
causes.<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c015'><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Lord O’Brien, L. C. J.</span>:—</p>

<p class='c019'>The facts which give rise to the controversy we have to determine, in this
case, are comprised within a narrow compass. The plaintiff, on a Saturday
morning, was coming into the town of Drogheda in a car driven by himself.
Coming near the town he, as he alleged, was overtaken by the horse and car of
Mrs. Morgan. She desired to pass. He says he made way for her, and, in
doing so, ran against a heap of stones on the road, and his car was upset and
he was injured. It appears that there were two heaps of stones on the road.
They had been, immediately before the collision, thrown on the road in order
that they might be spread on the road. The man who brought the load, and
had thrown them on the road, was a servant of the defendants. The intention
was to spread them immediately on the road. The man who brought them
was in fact, at the time of the accident, engaged in spreading the heap next the
town, some little distance from the heap where the accident occurred. Now
the first heap, where the accident occurred, was placed on the road in such a
position that there was between it and the right side of the road a space of
12 feet, and between this heap and the left side of the road, 6 feet. That is to
say, on the right side there was a space sufficient for two cars to pass simultaneously,
and on the left a space for one car to pass. The plaintiff’s case was
that, Mrs. Morgan overtaking him, he made room for her, pulled to the left,
and without any default of his, his car ran upon the heap and was capsized.
His case was that Mrs. Morgan caught him exactly where the heap was, and,
in endeavoring to avoid her, and without any default or negligence on his part,
the accident occurred. Now, three questions were left to the jury:—</p>

<p class='c019'>1. Were the defendants, by their workmen, guilty of negligence? Yes.</p>

<p class='c019'>2. Was the plaintiff guilty of negligence? Yes.</p>

<p class='c019'>And if so—</p>

<p class='c019'>3. Could the defendants, by the exercise of ordinary care, have avoided
the consequence of the plaintiff’s negligence? Yes.</p>

<p class='c019'>I have invariably refused, in these negligence cases, to leave questions in
this form to a jury. This formula appears to me calculated to perplex and
embarrass a jury. No doubt this formula is used, and judges do their best to
explain it, but I fear that when juries take up the questions in the jury-room,
the explanation has not the desired effect. Chief Justice Monahan consistently
refused to put the questions in this shape to the jury. I have always
tried these cases on two questions: 1st, Were the defendants guilty of negligence?
and, 2d, if so, was the defendant’s negligence the real, direct, and
immediate cause of the misfortune? Now, the jury in the present case
answered the questions submitted to them in the way I have read. I am of
opinion that the answer to the question finding that the plaintiff was guilty of
negligence, determines the matter in favor of the defendants. It is quite
plain, in my opinion, that his negligence was a direct contributory cause of the
accident. It was a cause which brought him on the heap of stones. Assuming
that there was negligence on the part of the defendants in having the stones
there, still his negligence must have contributed to his running up against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>them. He either did not keep a sufficient lookout, or his unskilful driving
brought him on the stones. Getting on the stones, through negligence, was at
least a contributory cause of the accident. It directly contributed to the
accident. If there be two causes directly contributing to the accident, one
the negligence of the defendant and the other the negligence of the plaintiff,
the result is a verdict for the defendant.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>BRITISH COLUMBIA ELECTRIC RAILWAY COMPANY <em>v.</em> LOACH<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Privy Council, July 26, 1915.</span><br /> <em>Reported in [1916] Appeal Cases, 719.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Lord Sumner.</span> This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal of British Columbia in favor of the administrator of the estate
of Benjamin Sands, who was run down at a level crossing by a car of
the appellant railway company and was killed. One Hall took Sands
with him in a cart, and they drove together on to the level crossing,
and neither heard nor saw the approaching car till they were close to
the rails and the car was nearly on them. There was plenty of light
and there was no other traffic about. The verdict, though rather
curiously expressed, clearly finds Sands guilty of negligence in not
looking out to see that the road was clear. It was not suggested in
argument that he was not under a duty to exercise reasonable care,
or that there was not evidence for the jury that he had disregarded
it. Hall, who escaped, said that they went “right on to the track,”
when he heard Sands, who was sitting on his left, say “Oh,” and
looking up saw the car about fifty yards off. He says he could then do
nothing, and with a loaded wagon and horses going two or three miles
an hour he probably could not. It does not seem to have been suggested
that Sands could have done any good by trying to jump off
the cart and clear the rails. The car knocked cart, horses, and men
over, and ran some distance beyond the crossing before it could be
stopped. It approached the crossing at from thirty-five to forty-five
miles an hour. The driver saw the horses as they came into view
from behind a shed at the crossing of the road and the railway, when
they would be ten or twelve feet from the nearest rail, and he at once
applied his brake. He was then 400 feet from the crossing. If the
brake had been in good order it should have stopped the car in 300
feet. Apart from the fact that the car did not stop in time, but
overran the crossing, there was evidence for the jury that the brake
was defective and inefficient and that the car had come out in the
morning with the brake in that condition. The jury found that the
car was approaching at an excessive speed and should have been
brought under complete control, and although they gave as their
reason for saying so the presence of possible passengers at the station
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>by the crossing, and not the possibility of vehicles being on the
road, there can be no mistake in the matter, and their finding stands.
It cannot be restricted, as the trial judge and the appellants sought to
restrict it, to a finding that the speed was excessive for an ill-braked
car, but not for a properly-braked car, or to a finding that there was
no negligence except the “original” negligence of sending the car
out ill-equipped in the morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Clearly if the deceased had not got on to the line he would have
suffered no harm, in spite of the excessive speed and the defective
brake, and if he had kept his eyes about him he would have perceived
the approach of the car and would have kept out of mischief. If the
matter stopped there, his administrator’s action must have failed, for
he would certainly have been guilty of contributory negligence. He
would have owed his death to his own fault, and whether his negligence
was the sole cause or the cause jointly with the railway company’s
negligence would not have mattered.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was for the jury to decide which portions of the evidence were
true, and, under proper direction, to draw their own inferences of fact
from such evidence as they accepted. No complaint was made against
the summing-up, and there has been no attempt to argue before their
Lordships that there was not evidence for the jury on all points. If
the jury accepted the facts above stated, as certainly they well might
do, there was no further negligence on the part of Sands after he
looked up and saw the car, and then there was nothing that he could
do. There he was, in a position of extreme peril and by his own
fault, but after that he was guilty of no fresh fault. The driver of the
car, however, had seen the horses some perceptible time earlier, had
duly applied his brakes, and if they had been effective he could, as the
jury found, have pulled up in time. Indeed, he would have had 100
feet to spare. If the car was 150 feet off when Sands looked up and
said “Oh,” then each had the other in view for fifty feet before the
car reached the point at which it should have stopped. It was the
motorman’s duty, on seeing the peril of Sands, to make a reasonable
use of his brakes in order to avoid injuring him, although it was by
his own negligence that Sands was in danger. Apparently he did his
best as things then were, but partly the bad brake and partly the
excessive speed, for both of which the appellants were responsible,
prevented him from stopping, as he could otherwise have done. On
these facts, which the jury were entitled to accept and appear to have
accepted, only one conclusion is possible. What actually killed Sands
was the negligence of the railway company, and not his own, though
it was a close thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the judges in the Courts below appear to have thought that
because the equipment of the car with a defective brake was the original
cause of the collision, and could not have been remedied after
Sands got on the line, no account should be taken of it in considering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the motorman’s failure to avoid the collision after he knew that Sands
was in danger. “You cannot charge up the same negligence under
different heads,” said Murphy, J., at the trial; “you cannot charge it
up twice.” “On the question of ultimate negligence,” he observed,
“that negligence must arise on the conditions as existing at the time
of the accident. It would, of course, be absurd to say the company
had any opportunity between the time that this rig appeared upon the
track and the collision to remedy any defect in the brake. If there
was such a defect I think it was original negligence and not what may
possibly be termed ‘ultimate negligence.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Court of Appeal Macdonald, C. J. A., delivering a dissentient
judgment in favor of the present appellants, said: “Where one party
negligently approaches a point of danger, and the other party, with
like obligation to take care, negligently approaches the same point of
danger, if there arises a situation which could be saved by one and not
by the other, and the former then negligently fail to use the means in
his power to save it, and injury is caused to the latter, that failure is
designated ultimate negligence, in the sense of being the proximate
cause of the injury. In this case it is sought to carry forward, as it
were, an anterior negligent omission of the defendants, though continuing,
it is true, up to the time of the occurrence, and to assign to it
the whole blame for the occurrence, although by no effort of the
defendants or their servants could the situation at that stage have
been saved.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So, too, McPhillips, J. A., also dissenting, said: “Upon the evidence,
whether it was because of defective brakes or any of the acts of
negligence found against the defendants, none of them were acts of
negligence arising after the act of contributory negligence of the deceased,
and cannot be held to be acts of negligence which, notwithstanding
the later negligence of the deceased, warrant judgment
going for the plaintiff.... The motorman after he saw the vehicle
could not have stopped the car&#160;... therefore, as nothing could be
then done by the motorman to remedy the ineffective brake, the want
of care of the deceased was the direct and effective contributory cause
of the accident resulting in his death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These considerations were again urged at their Lordships’ bar under
somewhat different forms. It was said (1) that the negligence relied
on as an answer to contributory negligence must be a new negligence,
the initial negligence which founded the cause of action being
spent and disposed of by the contributory negligence. Further, it
was said (2) that if the defendants’ negligence continued up to the
moment of the collision, so did the deceased’s contributory negligence,
and that this series, so to speak, of replications and rebutters
finally merged in the accident without the deceased ever having been
freed from the legal consequence of his own negligence having contributed
to it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>The last point fails because it does not correspond with the fact.
The consequences of the deceased’s contributory negligence continued,
it is true, but, after he had looked, there was no more negligence, for
there was nothing to be done, and, as it is put in the classic judgment
in Tuff <em>v.</em> Warman, (1858) 5 C. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 573, 585, his contributory
negligence will not disentitle him to recover “if the defendant might
by the exercise of care on his part have avoided the consequences of
the neglect or carelessness of the plaintiff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the former point, there seems to be some ambiguity in the
statement. It may be convenient to use a phraseology which has been
current for some time in the Canadian Courts, especially in Ontario,
though it is not precise. The negligence which the plaintiff proves to
launch his case is called “primary” or “original” negligence. The
defendant may answer that by proving against the plaintiff “contributory
negligence.” If the defendant fails to avoid the consequences
of that contributory negligence and so brings about the injury, which
he could and ought to have avoided, this is called “ultimate” or
“resultant” negligence. The opinion has been several times expressed,
in various forms, that “original” negligence and “ultimate”
negligence are mutually exclusive, and that conduct which has once
been relied on to prove the first cannot in any shape constitute proof
of the second.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here lies the ambiguity. If the “primary” negligent act is done
and over, if it is separated from the injury by the intervention of the
plaintiff’s own negligence, then no doubt it is not the “ultimate”
negligence in the sense of directly causing the injury. If, however,
the same conduct which constituted the primary negligence is repeated
or continued, and is the reason why the defendant does not avoid the
consequences of the plaintiff’s negligence at and after the time when
the duty to do so arises, why should it not be also the “ultimate”
negligence which makes the defendant liable?</p>

<p class='c007'>This matter was much discussed in Brenner <em>v.</em> Toronto Ry. Co.,
13 Ont. L. R. 423, when Anglin, J., delivered a very valuable judgment
in the Divisional Court. The decision of the Divisional Court
was reversed on appeal, 15 Ont. L. R. 195, (1908) 40 Can. S. C. R. 540,
but on other grounds, and in their comments on the decision of the
Divisional Court, Duff, J., in the Supreme Court, and also Chancellor
Boyd in Rice <em>v.</em> Toronto Ry. Co., (1910) 22 Ont. L. R. 446, 450, and
Hunter, C. J., in Snow <em>v.</em> Crow’s Nest Pass Coal Co., (1907) 13 B. C.
Rep. 145, 155, seem to have missed the point to which Anglin, J., had
specially addressed himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts of that case were closely similar to those in the present
appeal, and it was much relied on in argument in the court below.
Anglin, J., following the decision in Scott <em>v.</em> Dublin and Wicklow
Ry. Co., (1861) 11 Ir. C. L. Rep. 377, 394, observed as follows, 13
Ont. L. R. 437, 439, 440: “Again, the duty of the defendants to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>plaintiff, breach of which would constitute ‘ultimate’ negligence,
only arose when her danger was or should have been apparent. Prior
to that moment there was an abstract obligation incumbent upon
them to have their car equipped with efficient emergency appliances
ready and in condition to meet the requirements of such an occasion.
Had an occasion for the use of emergency appliances not arisen, failure
to fulfil that obligation would have given rise to no cause of action.
Upon the emergency arising, that abstract obligation became a concrete
duty owing to the plaintiff to avoid the consequences of her
negligence by the exercise of ordinary care.... Up to that moment
there was no such breach of duty to the plaintiff. In that sense the
failure of the defendants to avoid the mischief, though the result of an
antecedent want of care, was negligence which occurred, in the sense
of becoming operative, immediately after the duty, in the breach of
which it consisted, arose. It effectively intervened between the negligence
of the plaintiff and the happening of the casualty. But there is
a class of cases where a situation of imminent peril has been created,
either by the joint negligence of both plaintiff and defendant, or it
may be, by that of the plaintiff alone, in which, after the danger is or
should be apparent, there is a period of time, of some perceptible
duration, during which both or either may endeavor to avert the
impending catastrophe.... If, notwithstanding the difficulties of
the situation, efforts to avoid injury duly made would have been successful,
but for some self-created incapacity which rendered such
efforts inefficacious, the negligence that produced such a state of disability
is not merely part of the inducing causes—a remote cause or
a cause merely <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</span></i>—it is, in very truth, the efficient, the
proximate, the decisive cause of the incapacity, and therefore of the
mischief.... Negligence of a defendant incapacitating him from
taking due care to avoid the consequences of the plaintiff’s negligence,
may, in some cases, though anterior in point of time to the plaintiff’s
negligence, constitute ‘ultimate’ negligence, rendering the defendant
liable notwithstanding a finding of contributory negligence of the
plaintiff....”</p>

<p class='c007'>Their Lordships are of opinion that, on the facts of the present
case, the above observations apply and are correct. Were it otherwise
the defendant company would be in a better position, when they had
supplied a bad brake but a good motorman, than when the motorman
was careless but the brake efficient. If the superintendent engineer
sent out the car in the morning with a defective brake, which, on seeing
Sands, the motorman strove to apply, they would not be liable,
but if the motorman failed to apply the brake, which, if applied,
would have averted the accident, they would be liable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole law of negligence in accident cases is now very well
settled, and, beyond the difficulty of explaining it to a jury in terms of
the decided cases, its application is plain enough. Many persons are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>apt to think that, in a case of contributory negligence like the present,
the injured man deserved to be hurt, but the question is not one of
desert or the lack of it, but of the cause legally responsible for the injury.
However, when once the steps are followed the jury can see
what they have to do, for the good sense of the rules is apparent. The
inquiry is a judicial inquiry. It does not always follow the historical
method and begin at the beginning. Very often it is more convenient
to begin at the end, that is at the accident, and work back along the
line of events which led up to it. The object of the inquiry is to fix
upon some wrong-doer the responsibility for the wrongful act which
has caused the damage. It is in search not merely of a causal agency
but of the responsible agent. When that has been done, it is not necessary
to pursue the matter into its origins; for judicial purposes they
are remote. Till that has been done there may be a considerable sequence
of physical events, and even of acts of responsible human
beings, between the damage done and the conduct which is tortious
and is its cause. It is surprising how many epithets eminent judges
have applied to the cause, which has to be ascertained for this judicial
purpose of determining liability, and how many more to other acts and
incidents, which for this purpose are not the cause at all. “Efficient
or effective cause,” “real cause,” “proximate cause,” “direct cause,”
“decisive cause,” “immediate cause,” “causa causans,” on the one
hand, as against, on the other, “causa sine qua non,” “occasional
cause,” “remote cause,” “contributory cause,” “inducing cause,”
“condition,” and so on. No doubt in the particular cases in which
they occur they were thought to be useful or they would not have
been used, but the repetition of terms without examination in other
cases has often led to confusion, and it might be better, after pointing
out that the inquiry is an investigation into responsibility, to be content
with speaking of the cause of the injury simply and without
qualification.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present case their Lordships are clearly of opinion that,
under proper direction, it was for the jury to find the facts and to determine
the responsibility, and that upon the answers which they returned,
reasonably construed, the responsibility for the accident was
upon the appellants solely, because, whether Sands got in the way of
the car with or without negligence on his part, the appellants could
and ought to have avoided the consequences of that negligence, and
failed to do so, not by any combination of negligence on the part of
Sands with their own, but solely by the negligence of their servants
in sending out the car with a brake whose inefficiency operated to
cause the collision at the last moment, and in running the car at an
excessive speed, which required a perfectly efficient brake to arrest it.
Their Lordships will accordingly humbly advise His Majesty that the
appeal should be dismissed with costs.<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c015'><sup>[209]</sup></a></p>

  <h5 class='c013'>NEHRING <em>v.</em> THE CONNECTICUT COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Connecticut, July 19, 1912.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 86 Connecticut Reports, 109.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Prentice, J.</span> It is clear and unquestioned that there was evidence,
justifying its submission to the jury, tending to establish the defendant’s
negligence in the premises directly contributing to produce the
fatal injury which the plaintiff’s intestate suffered. The verdict for
the defendant was directed upon the ground that the plaintiff had
failed to present evidence, sufficient to go to the jury, tending to establish
the intestate’s freedom from contributory negligence. Plaintiff’s
counsel in his brief formally takes issue with this conclusion of the
court, asserting that the evidence was such as entitled the plaintiff to
go to the jury upon the question of the intestate’s negligence. It is
apparent, however, that little reliance is placed upon this particular
claim, and that the contention that the court erred must fail unless
the appeal which is made to the so-called doctrine of “the last clear
chance,” otherwise known as supervening or intervening negligence,
is well made. This appeal is urged with vigor, so that the plaintiff’s
main contention, which alone calls for serious consideration, is that,
notwithstanding the intestate’s failure to use ordinary care, the defendant
is liable through the operation of the doctrine referred to,
which, it is said, the court disregarded.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The notion appears to be more or less prevalent that this so-called
doctrine is a discovery of recent years, that it embodies a new legal
principle, and that this principle is one which invades the domain
formerly assigned to contributory negligence, and sets limitations
upon the operation of this latter doctrine so long and so deeply imbedded
in English and American jurisprudence. This is by no means
true as respects either the age or the character and scope of the
principle which it embodies. The names by which it has come to be
known are indeed of recent origin, and perhaps its present vogue and
the misconception which prevails as to its true place in the law of
negligence are due in part to its thus being given an independent
status in the terminology of the law. In fact, the principle is no
modern discovery. It runs back to the famous “Donkey Case” of
Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, 10 Mees. &amp; W. 546, decided in 1842. It was distinctly
recognized by this court in 1858 in Isbell <em>v.</em> New York &amp;
N. H. R. Co., 27 Conn. 393. It was then not only recognized, but its
true place in the law was assigned to it. It was shown to be no independent
principle operating by the side of, and possibly overstepping
the bounds of, other principles, but merely a logical and inevitable
corollary of the long accepted doctrine of actionable negligence as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>affected by contributory negligence. The definition of its place,
which was made in the clear-cut language of Judge Ellsworth, inexorably
forbade that it could by possibility run counter in its application
to the contributory negligence rule. This fundamental principle we
have steadily adhered to. Smith <em>v.</em> Connecticut Ry. &amp; Ltg. Co., 80
Conn. 268, 270, 67 Atl. 888; Elliott <em>v.</em> New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co.,
83 Conn. 320, 322, 76 Atl. 298, 84 Conn. 444, 447, 80 Atl. 283.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are, indeed, cases which give countenance to a different
view upon this latter subject. But their dicta, oftentimes, not to say
generally, uttered without an apparent comprehension of their logical
consequence, would create havoc with the law, and leave it guideless,
or with two conflicting guides. A sober second thought is, however,
fast correcting this mistake, so that there has already come to be a
general concurrence of the well-considered authorities in the view
which has been taken in this jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contributory negligence rule has no practical application save
in cases where the defendant has been guilty of actionable negligence.
It proceeds upon the theory that whenever a person injured has contributed
essentially to his injury by his own negligent conduct, the
law will not give him redress, even against another who may have been
directly instrumental in producing the result. To furnish a basis
for its application there must have been a concurrence of negligent
conduct. This negligent conduct, furthermore, must have been of
such a character and so related to the result as to entitle it to be considered
an efficient or proximate cause of it. If there is a failure to
use due care on the part of either party at such a time, in such a way
or in such a relation to the result that it cannot fairly be regarded as
an efficient or proximate cause, the law will take no note of it. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Causa
proxima, non remota, spectatur.</span></i></p>

<p class='c007'>It thus logically follows that, although a plaintiff may have failed
to exercise reasonable care in creating a condition, or in some other
way, which cannot be fairly said to have been the proximate cause of
the injuries of which he complains, the contributory negligence rule
cannot be invoked against him. The question with respect to negligent
conduct on the part of a person injured through the negligence of
another, as affecting the former’s right to recover, thus becomes resolved
in every case into one as to whether or not that conduct of his
was a proximate cause of the injury. If it was, then the contributory
negligence rule is applicable, and the plaintiff will by its operation
be barred from recovery. If it was not, that rule has no pertinence
to the situation, since there was no concurrence of negligence, without
which there can be no contributory negligence in the legal sense. It
is conduct of the latter kind—that is, conduct careless in itself, but
not connected with the injury as a proximate cause of it—to which
the so-called doctrine of “the last clear chance” relates, and that
doctrine embraces within its purview such conduct only.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>This being so, it may well be questioned whether the doctrine
deserves a classification and a name as of an independent principle.
But if, for convenience sake or other reason, it is to be dignified in
that way, it is apparent that there is no manner of inconsistency between
it and the contributory-negligence rule, and that the domain of
the latter rule is in no way invaded or narrowed by a full recognition
of it. It follows that the decisive question in each case, where a plaintiff
injured is found to have been at fault in the premises from his
failure to exercise the required degree of care, resolves itself into one
as to whether that fault was or was not a proximate cause of the
injury, and that the answer to that question will infallibly determine
whether or not it will bar a recovery.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>Thus far we have had the way marked out for us by the clearly
defined doctrine of former opinions. But the proposition just stated,
which is thus supported, while sufficient for the determination of many
cases and furnishing a helpful guide in most others, does not resolve
all the difficulties which may be encountered. It leaves the question
open as to when negligent conduct in a person injured in his person
or property is to be regarded as a proximate cause of the injury. How
close must be the causal connection between the negligence and the
injury? It is at this point that any real uncertainty or trouble arises
under the doctrine of this jurisdiction.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The negligence referred to in the claimed rule is, of course, that
which the law so denominates, to wit, want of due care which is a
proximate cause of harm. The proposition is not dealing with a lack
of due care which the law ignores. When it speaks of the negligence
ceasing, negligence in the legal sense is meant. It may in a given
sense cease in the sense that prudent conduct takes its place. It may
for all legal purposes cease through the relegation of it, as events progress,
to the domain of remote cause. In other words, it ceases when,
and only when, the conditions of contributory negligence disappear.
The claimed test thus solves no problems. It only brings one back, in
doubtful cases, to the inquiry whether the plaintiff’s conduct, lacking
in due care, was of such a character, or so related to the injury, that it
ought to be regarded as a proximate cause of it, as the real test which
must be applied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The impossibility of framing any general abstract statement which
will suffice to resolve the difficulties which may be presented under
varying conditions, or to anticipate all such conditions, is apparent.
We shall undertake no such task. There are, however, certain sets of
conditions, of not infrequent occurrence, concerning which general
conclusions may be made safely and profitably.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is, for instance, the occasional case where, after the plaintiff’s
peril, to which he has carelessly exposed himself or his property, becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>known to the defendant, the latter introduces into the situation
a new and independent act of negligence without which there would
have been no injury. Such was the case of Smith <em>v.</em> Connecticut Ry.
&amp; Ltg. Co., 80 Conn. 268, 270, 67 Atl. 888, and it was there held, in
accordance with sound reason, that this new negligence was to be
regarded as the sole proximate cause of the accident which ensued.
The rule for that type of case is thus furnished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cases of another class occasionally arise, where it is disclosed that
the plaintiff has by his lack of care placed himself in a position of
danger from which he either cannot, or cannot reasonably, escape after
the discovery of his danger. Here, again, there can be no hesitation
in saying, that if the defendant, after his discovery that the plaintiff
is in the situation described, fails to use reasonable care—and that is
care proportioned to the danger—to save him from harm, and harm
results from such failure, the defendant’s want of care will be regarded
as the sole proximate cause, and the plaintiff’s a remote cause
only.</p>

<p class='c007'>The situation just stated is not infrequently changed, in that means
of escape were open to the plaintiff by the exercise of reasonable care,
but it was apparent to the defendant, in season to have avoided the
doing of harm by the exercise of due care, that the plaintiff would not
avail himself of them. Here it is assumed that the situation of exposure
had been created and established by the plaintiff’s action before
the period of time began within which the defendant, acting reasonably,
might have saved him, and that within that period the plaintiff
did nothing to create or materially change that situation by active
conduct which was not marked by reasonable care. Under the assumption
he remains passive, in so far at least as negligent action is
concerned, and can be regarded as careless only in this that he did not
awake to his surroundings and do what he reasonably could to avoid
the threatened consequences of a situation which he had already
negligently brought about. In such cases the humane, and, to our
mind, the better reason, all things considered, leads to the conclusion
to which our former opinions, already cited, commit us, and which a
large number of cases elsewhere approve, that the want of care on the
part of the plaintiff will be regarded as a remote and not a proximate
cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another important variation is oftentimes introduced into the
situation, in that the plaintiff continued as an active agent in producing
the conditions under which his injury was received down to
the time of its occurrence, or at least until it was too late for the defendant,
with knowledge of his peril, to have saved him by the exercise
of reasonable care under the circumstances. This variation imports
into the situation an important factor. The plaintiff, during the
period named, is not merely passively permitting an already fixed
condition to remain unchanged. He is an actor upon the scene. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>is, by acts of his volition, bringing into the situation which confronts
the defendant changed conditions and, in the fullest sense, co-operating
with the latter in bringing about the ultimate result. In such
case his conduct must be regarded as a concurring efficient cause. It
is, in the fullest sense, a proximate and not a remote one, making his
negligence contributory.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said, however, that there are cases, and undoubtedly there are,
where it is reasonably apparent to the one who inflicts the injury that
the injured one is careless of his safety, and that, in continuance of
his carelessness, he is about to place himself in a position of danger,
which he subsequently does, and where the former thereafter, having a
reasonable opportunity to save him from harm, fails to do so; and it
is contended that in such cases the conduct of the injured person
should be regarded as a remote cause only of the resulting harm. We
are unable to discover any logical reason for such a conclusion, or any
place at which a practical or certain line of division can be drawn
between that careless conduct of a man, playing some part in an injury
to him, which the law will regard as having that causal connection
with the injury which makes it a proximate cause, and that careless
conduct which will not be so regarded, if the contention under consideration
is to be approved. The conduct of the man who inflicts
the injury under such general conditions may indeed be such that it
is open to the charge of wilfulness or wantonness. If so, the case is
not one of negligence, and the defense of contributory negligence
would not be available. Rowen <em>v.</em> New York, N. Y. &amp; H. R. Co., 59
Conn. 364, 371, 21 Atl. 1073. If the conduct is not wilful or wanton,
it is negligent only. Thus treated, it forms one factor of negligence
in the situation. The plaintiff’s want of care is another factor, and
it certainly has something substantial to do in bringing about the
result reached. Upon what theory or foundation in reason it can be
said that, under the circumstances assumed, it is not an efficient cause
of that result co-operating concurrently with the other cause to be
found in the other party’s negligence, we are unable to discover. The
causal connection is plain to be seen, and the act of causation is that
of a positive act of volition. The two actors upon the scene owe precisely
the same duty to be reasonably careful. Dexter <em>v.</em> McCready,
54 Conn. 171, 174, 5 Atl. 855. Neither occupies in that regard a
superior position, and the one who suffers can claim no precedence
over his fellow actor or at the hands of the law. To say that no matter
if one be negligent in going forward into danger, or in creating new
conditions or complicating them, the law will protect him and cast
upon the other party the responsibility for the result, is to ignore the
fundamental principle of contributory negligence and bring the law
upon that subject into hopeless confusion, and merit for it the condemnation
which Thompson has so forcibly expressed. 1 Thompson
on Negligence, §§ 230, 233. The well-considered cases which have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>directly dealt with this subject agree with us, we think, in our view
that active continuing negligence of the kind assumed is to be regarded
as contributory in the legal sense. Butler <em>v.</em> Rockland, T. &amp; C.
Street Ry. Co., 99 Me. 149, 160, 58 Atl. 775; Murphy <em>v.</em> Deane, 101
Mass. 455, 465; Dyerson <em>v.</em> Union Pacific R. Co., 74 Kan. 528, 87
Pac. 680; Little <em>v.</em> Superior Rapid Transit Ry. Co., 88 Wis. 402, 409,
60 N. W. 705; Green <em>v.</em> Los Angeles Terminal Ry. Co., 143 Cal. 31,
47, 76 Pac. 719; Olson <em>v.</em> Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 84 Minn. 258,
87 N. W. 843.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have thus far dealt with cases in which actual knowledge on the
part of the defendant of the plaintiff’s peril enters into the assumption
of facts. Suppose, however, that such knowledge is not established,
but facts are shown from which it is claimed that the defendant ought
in the exercise of due care to have known of it. What shall be said
of such a situation?</p>

<p class='c007'>In so far as imputed or constructive knowledge may be embraced
in the assumption, the simple answer is to be found in the legal principle
that full and adequate means of knowledge, present to a person
when he acts, are, under ordinary circumstances, treated as the
equivalent of knowledge. Post <em>v.</em> Clark, 35 Conn. 339, 342.</p>

<p class='c007'>But our assumption reaches outside of the domain of knowledge,
either actual or constructive. It suggests, in the use of the phrase
“ought in the exercise of due care to have known,” frequently met
with in the books, the existence of a duty to exercise due care to acquire
knowledge, and the query is, whether the law recognizes the
existence of such a duty to the extent of making it a foundation for
responsibility for conduct akin to that which flows from conduct with
actual or constructive knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have frequently held that the character of one’s conduct in
respect to care is to be determined in view of what he should have
known as well as of what he did in fact know. Snow <em>v.</em> Coe Brass
Mfg. Co., 80 Conn. 63, 66 Atl. 881. In these cases the question has
been as to one’s duty for his own self-protection. That duty, according
to established principles, involves the making of reasonable use of
one’s senses under the penalty of forfeiture of all claim for redress
in the event that harm results. Popke <em>v.</em> New York, N. H. &amp; H. R.
Co., 81 Conn. 724, 71 Atl. 1098.</p>

<p class='c007'>But how about a duty of acquiring knowledge, owed to others for
their safety, which, not being performed, will furnish a basis of liability?
In Elliott <em>v.</em> New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 83 Conn. 320,
76 Atl. 298, we recognized that such a duty might exist. That case
involved the conduct of a locomotive engineer operating his engine
at a grade-crossing, and we approved a charge which gave to the
knowledge which the engineer, under the conditions, ought, in the
use of due care, to have had, the same effect as actual knowledge. The
duty imposed upon him was one to be watchful in order that needless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>harm might not come to persons who might be using the crossing,
from the dangerous instrument of his calling. The duty was one toward
others, which the circumstances and conditions must be regarded
as fairly creating. For a like reason a similar duty rests upon
other persons and under other conditions, in greater or lesser measure.
Whether it exists, and the extent of it, depends upon the circumstances
of each situation. A circumstance of chief significance, perhaps, is
one which concerns the character of that about which the person is
engaged in respect to its being calculated, under the conditions, to
work injury to others. And so it is that a locomotive engineer, a
motorman of a trolley-car running in a highway, or a chauffeur driving
an automobile, is under a duty to be watchful for the protection
of others which another man under other conditions would not owe
to his fellows. Unreasonableness in one’s conduct, as a foundation
for responsibility to others, cannot justly be established upon the
basis of knowledge not possessed. It can with propriety be predicated
upon negligence in not having acquired more knowledge. Negligence
in this respect, as in all others, implies the existence of a duty to make
use of means of knowledge. This duty must be found in the circumstances,
and caution must be exercised in order that it, with its consequences,
be not raised where the circumstances do not fairly impose
it, or be extended beyond the limits which the circumstances fairly
justify.<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c015'><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>George W. Wheeler, J.</span> (dissenting). Just prior to the accident
the defendant’s car was being negligently operated. Assuming the
decedent walked either diagonally toward and upon the track, or close
to it, without using his senses to learn of the approaching car, and
that there was no excuse for his failure, he was negligent. If the
accident occurred while decedent and defendant were negligent and
decedent’s negligence was a proximate cause of the accident, and there
was nothing more to the case, there could be no recovery. But if the
defendant’s motorman saw, or could by the exercise of reasonable care
have seen, the decedent either approaching the track and about to
place himself in danger, or walking so near the track as to be in danger,
apparently heedless and unconscious of his peril, he owed to the deceased
the duty of warning him and of observing such precautions as
might avoid running into him. This was the case before the jury. We
hold knowledge and the means of knowledge of one having a duty to
know equivalent. Elliott <em>v.</em> New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 83 Conn.
320, 76 Atl. 298. This duty originated after the negligence of the
motorman and of the deceased, and after the latter’s peril and his
unconsciousness of it might have been discovered by the motorman.
If its performance would have avoided the injury to the deceased, its
breach was the proximate cause of the accident, and his negligence in
placing himself in the place of peril a condition, or the remote cause,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>of it. Of course, if he had not gone upon the track he would not have
been injured; if he was negligent in going upon the track without
using his senses, that was not the proximate cause of the accident, but
the failure of the defendant to avoid the accident after it had the opportunity
of avoidance and after it knew of the decedent’s peril and
his unconsciousness of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In each case of discovered peril caused by one’s negligence the question
is, did the defendant have the opportunity after such discovery,
and was it his duty, to have avoided the accident? Whether the
conduct of the motorman was gross negligence, or ordinary negligence,
the breach of duty was the same in kind, though differing in degree.
If one walks upon a railway track drunk, or in a reverie, or otherwise
careless; or if one stands or lies on or so near the railway track as to
be in danger and unconscious of it; or if one is in a position of peril
through his own negligence from which he is unable to extricate himself,
the person knowing or having the means and the duty to know
of his presence owes him the duty of avoiding injuring him. One
who is negligently in a position of danger and unconscious of it is in
no different situation than if he were incapable of extricating himself
from his peril.</p>

<p class='c007'>The few authorities which hold the antecedent negligence of the
deceased in getting into peril is concurrent with the defendant’s negligence
so as to bar a recovery, make meaningless the rule of duty compelling
the defendant to use reasonable care to avoid the accident after
discovery of the peril. A legal duty without a corresponding obligation
is an anomaly. When we relieve the motorman of liability for
failure to avoid an accident, he may operate his car at a negligent
speed, without having it under control, without keeping an outlook,
without giving warning of approach, and neither having nor using
the ordinary instrumentalities of equipment for avoiding injury to
travellers, and so long as his conduct is not gross negligence it carries
with it no liability.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opinion of the court classifies in five groups the several kinds
of cases which have been thought to be within the “last clear chance”
doctrine. In group one, the defendant, instead of doing his duty,
does something which is a new act of negligence. In group two, the
peril is one from which the plaintiff cannot, or cannot reasonably,
extricate himself. Each group supports a recovery. In group three,
means of escape were open to the plaintiff down to the accident, but
he remained unconscious of his peril. The opinion holds that if the
plaintiff remains passive after exposing himself to peril and does
nothing to materially change that condition, there may be a recovery.
But in group four, assuming the same facts as in group three, the
court holds that if the plaintiff after exposing himself to peril, instead
of permitting the fixed condition to remain unchanged continues as
an active agent in producing the conditions under which the injury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>was received down to its occurrence, or until it was too late for the
defendant to avoid the accident, there can be no recovery. In group
five, the defendant knows, or ought to know, that the injured one is
careless and is about to expose himself to danger of which he is unconscious,
and after such knowledge has the opportunity to avoid injury
to him, and in such case the court holds there can be no recovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have attempted to show that the breach of duty of the defendant
in each of these several groups is the same, and was a new act of
negligence of the defendant, viz.: the failure of the defendant to avoid
injuring the plaintiff after he knew of his peril when he was either unconscious
of it or incapable of extricating himself from it, and that this
breach was the proximate cause of the accident while the plaintiff’s
prior negligence was the remote cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction between active and passive negligence made in
groups three and four, is new to our law, as well as to the law of negligence
generally prevailing in this country and in England. On analysis
it does not seem logical. A is crossing a trolley track when hailed
by a friend; he stops upon the track to talk and negligently fails to
use his senses to discover an approaching car. The motorman could
have seen A in his place of peril, unconscious of his danger, and in
time, with the exercise of reasonable care to have avoided injuring
him; instead he drives on his car and kills A. The opinion would hold
A negligent in being upon the track without using his senses to keep
out of the way of the oncoming car, but that as he remained passive
and did nothing to change his situation of peril after the motorman
had the opportunity to have avoided the accident, he may recover.
But if A, instead of stopping on the track had gone on his way across
or upon the track and been struck, his negligence would have been
active and continued to the accident and would have been concurrent
with that of the motorman. It must be conceded that the breach of
the motorman’s duty would have been the same in each case: a failure
to use reasonable care to avoid the accident. We see no reason why
it should be available in the one case and not in the other. In neither
case has the plaintiff’s negligence changed. It never became passive
or nonexistent. It remained to the time of the accident. It ceased,
in a legal sense, to be a proximate cause of the accident. A was relieved
of its consequences because the negligence of the motorman in
failing to avoid the accident intervened and became its proximate
cause. If this distinction holds, and A be upon a trolley track intoxicated
and asleep, his negligence is passive; if awake and walking his
negligence is active.<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c015'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

  <h5 class='c013'>GAHAGAN <em>v.</em> BOSTON &amp; MAINE RAILROAD<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New Hampshire, December, 1900.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 70 New Hampshire Reports, 441.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Plaintiff was struck by a train while attempting to use a crossing
provided by the Railroad Company for persons having business with
a manufacturing company. From a point twenty-two feet from the
nearest rails there was an unobstructed view of the track in the direction
from which the train came. The accident happened near noon on
a bright and clear day. Generally the engine bell was rung, while the
whistle was sometimes sounded, for this crossing. Plaintiff knew it
was usual to ring the bell. In this instance a danger whistle was
sounded at, or immediately before, the time when plaintiff was struck;
but there was evidence tending to prove that no other warning of the
approach of the train was given. Plaintiff testified that he did not
look or listen for an approaching train; and that he did not look because
he expected to hear the bell or whistle if one was coming. The
engineer testified that, when about one hundred and fifty to two
hundred feet from the crossing, he saw plaintiff approaching the
track; and that he kept watch of plaintiff until he got within a few
feet of the track, when he whistled.<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c015'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A nonsuit was ordered, subject to exception.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Parsons, J.</span>... It is urged that the plaintiff relied upon the ringing
of the bell, and that the failure to give the warning signals (of
which there was some evidence which must here be taken to be true)
excused him from the exercise of vigilance. Though the plaintiff testified
that he did not look to see if a train was approaching because he
expected to hear the whistle or bell if there was, it cannot be claimed
that he was consciously at the time placing any reliance thereon, for
he further testifies that he had no thought of a train coming and did
not listen for the bell. As his counsel state in their brief, “There
was no positive effort, no conscious ‘harking’ or ‘listening’ to ascertain
if the train was coming.” But assuming that it might be found
as a fact that he did rely on the awakening of his consciousness by the
performance of the railroad’s duty of warning, the failure of the defendants
to perform their duty did not release him from his. The
obligation to use care was equally imposed upon each. If the defendants’
negligence excused the plaintiff from his duty of care, the plaintiff’s
negligence with equal reason would excuse the defendants. If
the plaintiff had the right to assume the defendants would perform
their duty, and, relying thereon, approach the crossing without exercising
care, the defendants had the right to assume that the plaintiff
would perform his duty, and omit the warning of bell and whistle.
The duty of care rested on each equally. If neither performed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>duty both are in fault, and neither can recover of the other. The
collision in this case resulted, it may be, because neither party performed
their duty. If either had, there might and probably would
have been no accident. The rights and liabilities of the parties consequent
upon their acts resulting in the collision are not affected by
the fact that subsequently one is plaintiff and the other defendant in
a suit growing out of the collision. Their several responsibility is
fixed at the time by their acts or failure to act. A suit by the engineer
against Gahagan for personal injury resulting from the collision
would present precisely the same legal question as that we now have.
It would hardly be urged that the engineer was not guilty of contributory
negligence in failing to ring the bell because he relied upon
Gahagan’s performance of his duty of stopping and allowing the train
to go by. The negligence of neither is an excuse for concurrent want
of care in the other, because for an injury resulting from the concurrent
negligence of both neither can recover. Nashua Iron and Steel
Co. <em>v.</em> Railroad, 62 N. H. 159, 163.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rule is laid down in Railroad Co. <em>v.</em> Houston, 95 U. S. 697, 702,
also a crossing case, as follows: “The failure of the engineer to sound
the whistle or ring the bell, if such were the fact, did not relieve the
deceased from the necessity of taking ordinary precautions for her
safety. Negligence of the company’s employees in these particulars
was no excuse for negligence on her part.”</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>It is not claimed that after the plaintiff stepped upon the track
almost immediately in front of the approaching train the defendants
could have prevented the injury, or that the employees in charge of
the train, when the danger thus became imminent, did not do all that
could be done to prevent the collision. At any time before this the
plaintiff could have avoided the collision. There was no moment
when the defendants could, while the plaintiff could not, have prevented
the injury. The plaintiff’s act in stepping upon the track,
without precaution to ascertain whether he could safely do so, was the
last act in point of time in the causation producing the injury. As
there was no evidence upon which it could reasonably be found that
the plaintiff’s action in this respect was the exercise of care, he cannot
recover unless upon the evidence some negligent act or omission of
the defendants’ employees could be found to be the sole proximate
cause of the injury.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff’s negligent occupation of the track did not authorize
the defendants to run upon and injure him, if by care they could have
avoided it. Ordinarily, the negligent act or omission which fails to
avoid the consequences of the plaintiff’s negligence is the last act in
time in the series leading to the injury. Such was the case in the
cases cited; the negligent occupation of the track by the plaintiffs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>preceded the negligence of the defendants in failing to observe and
guard against the danger so produced. But as ordinary care may require
vigilance to guard against a dangerous situation reasonably to
be apprehended, as well as actually imminent, it cannot always follow
that the last negligent act in point of time is necessarily the proximate
cause of the injury. If the engineer knew or ought to have
known that the plaintiff’s negligence would place him upon the crossing
when the train reached it, the engineer was equally bound to avoid
the collision as if he saw the plaintiff actually on the track. The
question is one of evidence merely. The mere fact that the person
when first seen is on the track is not decisive. If a person on foot is
seen crossing the track at such distance ahead that it could not reasonably
be apprehended that the train would reach him in this position,
the engineer would not be in fault for not preparing to avoid a
danger not reasonably to be expected. In the present case there is
evidence that when the plaintiff was first seen by the engineer the
collision could have been prevented. If the engineer knew or ought
to have known then that the plaintiff would be upon the crossing
when the train reached it, and could have avoided the collision, his
failure to do so is the proximate cause of the injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>As there was evidence the collision might then have been prevented
by him, the sole remaining question is whether upon the evidence
reasonable men might find the engineer ought then to have foreseen
the plaintiff’s negligence. The bare fact that the plaintiff was seen
approaching the track is not sufficient to authorize such a finding. If
it were, the rule heretofore laid down and found to be approved by the
authorities and the reason of the case, that it is the duty of the highway
traveller to stop and allow the train to pass, would be reversed.
It would become the duty of the train to stop and wait for the person
on foot to go by. This would be unreasonable, impracticable, and put
an end to the modern system of rapid transportation demanded by the
public, and to effectuate which railroads are authorized by the state.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The company’s servants may ordinarily presume that a person
apparently of full age and capacity, who is walking on the track at
some distance before the engine, will leave it in time to save himself
from harm; or if approaching the track, that he will stop if it becomes
dangerous for him to cross it. This presumption will not be justified
under some circumstances, as when the person who is on the track
appears to be intoxicated, asleep, or otherwise off his guard.” Pierce

general principle of right acting and the instinct of self-preservation.

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>The case discloses no evidence apparent to the engineer taking the
present case out of the rule.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>Aside from the plaintiff’s own statement and the fact of the subsequent
collision, the case contains no evidence that the plaintiff, when
seen by the engineer approaching the crossing, was not alert to the
situation, or tending to produce a belief that he would voluntarily
rush into danger without care. Until he stepped upon the track his
only danger consisted in the fact of his mental obliviousness to his
duty of taking care. So defining his danger, the claim of his counsel,
that if the engineer knew the plaintiff’s danger he could have avoided
the injury and is in fault for not doing so, is sound; but to submit to
the jury the question of fact whether the engineer ought to have
known the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">status</span></i> of the plaintiff’s mind in season to have prevented
the accident, not only in the absence of evidentiary facts tending to
prove such knowledge but in the face of all the facts open only to a
contrary inference, would be a violation of the familiar and elementary
rule that in judicial trials facts are to be found upon evidence,
not conjecture. Deschenes <em>v.</em> Railroad, 69 N. H. 285.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evidence upon which counsel mainly rely, tending to show that
when seen by the engineer Gahagan’s face was not turned toward the
train and that his appearance did not indicate whether he saw the train
or not, does not tend to establish that he proposed to rush carelessly
into known danger, or that he would go upon the track without care
to ascertain if a train was approaching. That Gahagan knew the
crossing, its danger, and his approach to it, was conceded. Hence, in
the face of this admitted fact, although this evidence may have some
tendency to prove the contrary, the jury could not find that Gahagan
did not know he was approaching a place of danger, or that the engineer
ought to have inferred a fact which it is conceded did not exist.
As there is no evidence that the defendants ought to have known the
plaintiff’s danger in season to have avoided the results of his negligence,
they cannot be found guilty of negligence for not doing so.</p>

use any measure to prevent the accident. Such being the issue to be determined,

licensee or a trespasser. He was a human being, and when his dangerous position
was seen and known, and that he himself was unconscious of his peril, and
would take no measures for his own protection, it became the duty of the
railroad company to do all that could be done consistent with its higher duties
to others to save him from the consequences of his own act, regardless of
whether he was guilty of contributory negligence or not. Seaboard &amp; Roanoke

<p class='c014'>Appeal from Polk District Court.</p>

<p class='c007'>Action by an administratrix to recover damages for the death of her
husband, Dennis O’Keefe, alleged to have been killed by being run
over on the defendant’s road, through the negligence of the defendant’s
agents and employees. Defence in denial, and also that the
death was caused by the drunkenness and negligence of the plaintiff’s
intestate. There was a jury trial, resulting in a verdict and judgment
for plaintiff for $1000. The defendant appeals.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cole, J.</span> [Omitting statement of evidence.] After the evidence
was closed, the defendant asked the court to instruct the jury as follows:
“If you are satisfied from the evidence that Dennis O’Keefe,
plaintiff’s intestate, was, a short time before the alleged injury, in a
state of intoxication; that in such condition he went upon defendant’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>railroad and laid himself down upon the track, or fell down unable
to support himself because of such intoxication; that remaining
in that condition a passing train crushed one of his legs; that after the
injury he was yet under the influence of intoxicating liquors drank
before the injury; that the injured limb was amputated and death ensued,
you will find for the defendant, unless you further find from a
preponderance of the evidence that defendant or its agents had knowledge
that he was thus lying in time to prevent the accident,” to which
the court added, and then gave it, “<em>or, could have known with the
exercise of ordinary caution</em>.” This modification was excepted to at
the time, and is now assigned as error.</p>

<p class='c007'>The well-established law of this state is, that in an action to recover
damages for the negligent act of the defendant, the plaintiff will not
be entitled to recover if his own negligence contributed directly to the
injury. In other words, this court recognizes and applies the doctrine
of “contributory negligence,” and not the doctrine of “comparative
negligence.” The latter doctrine obtains only in Illinois and Georgia,
while the former obtains in the other states, and also in the Federal
courts. The modification complained of ignored the doctrine of contributory
negligence, and substantially told the jury that plaintiff
might recover without regard to his negligence, if the defendant could
have prevented the injury with the exercise of ordinary caution. The
doctrine of the modification goes even farther than that of comparative
negligence; for, by the latter, a plaintiff can only recover when
he shows the defendant’s negligence to have been greater, by comparison,
than his, while by the modification the plaintiff might recover if
the defendant did not exercise ordinary caution, although the plaintiff’s
intestate may have been guilty of a much greater negligence in
laying himself down, in a condition of intoxication, near to or upon the
track. A similar modification was made to the second instruction.
In each there was error.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Avery, J.</span><a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c015'><sup>[213]</sup></a> The most important question presented by the appeal is

at his command, to have stopped the train before it reached him.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>In Gunter <em>v.</em> Wicker, 85 N. C. 310, this court gave its sanction to the principle
first distinctly formulated in Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, 10 M. &amp; W. (Ex.) 545,
that “Notwithstanding the previous negligence of the plaintiff, if at the time
the injury was done it might have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable
care and prudence on the part of the defendant, an action will lie for damages.”
This doctrine was subsequently approved in Saulter <em>v.</em> Steamship Co.,
88 N. C. 123; Turrentine <em>v.</em> Railroad, 92 N. C. 638; Meredith <em>v.</em> Iron Co., 99

104 N. C. 108; Bullock <em>v.</em> Railroad, 105 N. C. 180, and it was repeatedly
declared in those cases that it was negligence on the part of the engineer of a
railway company to fail to exercise reasonable care in keeping a lookout not
only for stock and obstructions but for apparently helpless or infirm human
beings on the track, and that the failure to do so supervening after the negligence
of another, where persons or animals were exposed to danger, would be
deemed the proximate cause of any resulting injury.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>[As to argument for defendant.] But the reasons and the authorities relied
upon emanate generally from courts which hold that both persons and animals
upon a track are trespassers and entitled to consideration only where
actually seen in time to save them....</p>

<p class='c019'>It cannot be denied that, in a number of the states which have adopted the
doctrine of Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, it has also been held that both man and beast
were trespassers when they went upon a railway track and except at public
crossings or in towns it was not the duty of the engineer to exercise care in
looking to his front with a view to the protection of either. Where the law
does not impose the duty of watchfulness it follows that the failure to watch
is not an omission, of duty intervening between the negligence of the plaintiff
in exposing himself and the accident, unless he be actually seen in time to
avert it. The negligence of the corporation grows out of omission of a legal
duty and there can be no omission where there is no duty prescribed.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>We are of opinion that, when by the exercise of ordinary care an engineer
can see that a human being is lying apparently helpless from any cause on the
track in front of his engine in time to stop the train by the use of the appliances
at his command and without peril to the safety of persons on the train, the
company is liable for any injury resulting from his failure to perform his duty.
If it is the settled law of North Carolina (as we have shown) that it is the duty
of an engineer on a moving train to maintain a reasonably vigilant outlook
along the track in his front, then the failure to do so is an omission of a legal
duty. If by the performance of that duty an accident might have been
averted, notwithstanding the previous negligence of another, then, under the
doctrine of Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, and Gunter <em>v.</em> Wicker,<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c015'><sup>[214]</sup></a> the breach of duty was
the proximate cause of any injury growing out of such accident, and where it is
a proximate cause the company is liable to respond in damages. Having
adopted the principle that one whose duty it is to see does see, we must follow
it to its logical results. The court committed no error of which the defendant
could justly complain in stating the general rule which we have been
discussing.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>Plaintiff sued for damages caused by being struck by the tender of an
engine.</p>

<p class='c019'>Plaintiff, an employee of the R. R. Co., had occasion to cross the track. As
he was about to step upon the track, he was struck by the tender of a locomotive
which was backing east at the rate of fifteen or twenty miles an hour without
giving a signal of its approach and without keeping a lookout along the
track. The track was straight for a quarter of a mile west. It was a clear day,
and there was nothing to have prevented the plaintiff from seeing the engine
and tender if he had looked.<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c015'><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>At the trial, the court rendered judgment against plaintiff upon his petition
and preliminary statement to the jury which disclosed the above facts. Plaintiff
brought error.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Mason, J.</span></p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>Finally it is contended in behalf of the plaintiff that, even admitting his own
want of care to have been such as would ordinarily bar a recovery, still he had
a right to submit to the jury the question whether the employees in charge of
the engine by the use of reasonable diligence could have discovered his negligence
in time to avert the accident, and that an affirmative answer would have
entitled him to a verdict.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>In a number of cases it has been held that if the engineer by the exercise of
reasonable diligence could have learned that danger was imminent but did not
do so, the liability of the company will be determined in all respects as though
he had in fact become aware of it, the constructive knowledge being apparently
deemed the equivalent of actual knowledge. It is difficult or impossible
to reconcile the decisions upon this and related questions, or to derive
from them any generally accepted statement either of principle or result.
Many of them are collected and discussed in chapter ix of volume i of Thompson’s
Commentaries on the Law of Negligence, especially in sections 222 to
247.</p>

<p class='c019'>There seems, however, to be no sufficient reason why the mere fact that a
defendant is negligent in failing to discover a plaintiff’s negligence, or his danger,
should in and of itself exclude all consideration of contributory negligence.
Take the not unusual situation of a train being negligently operated, let us say
by being run at too high a speed and without proper signals of warning being
given. Now, any one injured as a result of such negligence has <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> a
right to recover. But, if his own negligence has contributed to his injury, then
ordinarily his right is barred. How is the situation altered if the railroad employees
add to their negligence in regard to speed and signals the negligence of
failing to keep a sufficient lookout? The negligence is of the same sort; and, if
the contributory negligence of the person injured prevents a recovery when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>but the two elements of negligence are present, consistency requires that it
should have the same effect although a third element is added. If in the present
case the plaintiff was entitled to recover in spite of his own negligence it
must be because the order of its occurrence with respect to that of the defendant
made the latter the proximate cause of the injury. This indeed is his
contention, and to support it reliance is placed upon the following text, which
was quoted with approval in Railway Co. <em>v.</em> Arnold, 67 Kan. 260, 72 Pac. 857,
and the substance of which is to be found also in volume xx of the American
and English Encyclopædia of Law, at page 137:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“And upon the principle that one will be charged with notice of that which
by ordinary care he might have known, it is held that if either party to an
action involving the questions of negligence and contributory negligence
should, by the exercise of ordinary care, have discovered the negligence of the
other, after its occurrence, in time to foresee and avoid its consequences, then
such party is held to have notice; and his negligence in not discovering the
negligence of the other, under such circumstances, is held the sole proximate
cause of a following injury.” (7 A. &amp; E. Encycl. of L. 387.)</p>

<p class='c019'>This may be accepted as a correct statement of a principle of universal
application, according with both reason and authority, provided the words
“after its occurrence” be interpreted to mean after the person concerned had
ceased to be negligent. The rule that under the circumstances stated the
neglect of one party to discover the omission of the other is to be held to be the
sole proximate cause of a resulting injury is not an arbitrary but a reasonable
one. The test is, What wrongful conduct occasioning an injury was in operation
at the very moment it occurred or became inevitable? If just before that
climax only one party had the power to prevent the catastrophe, and he
neglected to use it, the legal responsibility is his alone. If, however, each had
such power, and each neglected to use it, then their negligence was concurrent
and neither can recover against the other. As is said in the paragraph from
which the foregoing quotation is made, “it is only when the negligence of one
party is subsequent to that of the other that the rule can be invoked.” In a
note printed in volume ii of the supplement to the American and English
Encyclopædia of Law, at page 64, many recent cases are cited bearing on the
subject, and it is said:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“This so-called exception to the rule of contributory negligence (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, the
doctrine of ‘the last clear chance’) will not be extended to cases where the
plaintiff’s own negligence extended up to and actually contributed to the injury.
To warrant its application there must have been some new breach of
duty on the part of the defendant subsequent to the plaintiff’s negligence.”</p>

<p class='c019'>In the present case it may be granted that the negligence of the plaintiff
began when he walked between the track and the ice-box on the way to get the
bucket, and that the employees in charge of the engine were themselves negligent
in not discovering this negligence on his part and the peril to which it exposed
him, and taking steps to protect him. But his negligence as well as theirs
continued up to the moment of the accident, or until it could not possibly
be averted. His opportunity to discover and avoid the danger was at least as
good as theirs. His want of care existing as late as theirs was a concurring
cause of his injury, and bars his recovery. This determination is entirely
consistent with what Mr. Thompson in his work above cited has styled the
“last clear chance” doctrine, as is obvious from a consideration of the terms
in which it is stated. As originally announced it was thus phrased:—</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“The party who has the last opportunity of avoiding accident is not excused
by the negligence of any one else. His negligence, and not that of the
one first in fault, is the sole proximate cause of the injury.” (1 Shear. &amp; Red.
Law of Neg., 5th ed., § 99.)</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Thompson rewords it as follows:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“Where both parties are negligent, the one that had the last clear opportunity
to avoid the accident, notwithstanding the negligence of the other, is
solely responsible for it—his negligence being deemed the direct and proximate
cause of it.” (1 Thomp. Com. Law Neg. § 240.)</p>

<p class='c019'>Expressions are to be found in the reports seemingly at variance with the
conclusion here reached, but for the most part the decisions holding a defendant
liable for failure to discover and act upon the plaintiff’s negligence were
made in cases which were in fact like Railway Co. <em>v.</em> Arnold, 67 Kan. 260, 72
Pac. 857, or were decided upon the theory that they fell within the same rule.
There the plaintiff’s decedent while riding a bicycle was through his own fault
run into by a street car; he clung to the fender, was carried some seventy-five
feet, then fell under the wheels, and was killed. A judgment against the
street-car company was upheld only upon the theory that after he had reached
a position of danger from which he could not extricate himself—that is, after
his negligence had ceased—the defendant’s employees were negligent in
failing to discover his peril and stop the car.</p>

<p class='c019'>In Robinson <em>v.</em> Cone, 22 Vt. 213, 54 Am. Dec. 67, the writer of the opinion
said:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“I should hesitate to say that if it appeared that the want of ordinary care
on the part of the plaintiff, <em>at the very time of the injury</em>, contributed either to
produce or to enhance the injury, he could recover; because it seems to me
that is equivalent to saying that the plaintiff, by the exercise of ordinary care
at the time, could have escaped the injury.” (Page 223.)</p>

<p class='c019'>The principle thus intimated was embodied in a decision in French <em>v.</em> The
Grand Trunk Railway Co., 76 Vt. 441, 58 Atl. 722, where it was said:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“It is true that when a traveller has reached a point where he cannot help
himself, cannot extricate himself, and vigilance on his part will not avert the
injury, his negligence in reaching that position becomes the condition and not
the proximate cause of the injury, and will not preclude a recovery; but it is
equally true that if a traveller, when he reaches the point of collision, is in a
situation to help himself, and by a vigilant use of his eyes, ears, and physical
strength to extricate himself and avoid injury, his negligence at that point will
prevent a recovery, notwithstanding the fact that the trainmen could have
stopped the train in season to have avoided injuring him. In such a case the
negligence of the plaintiff is concurrent with the negligence of the defendant,
and the negligence of each is operative at the time of the accident. When negligence
is concurrent and operative at the time of the collision, and contributes
to it, there can be no recovery.” (Page 447.)</p>

<p class='c019'>To the same effect are these extracts:—</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>[As to the rule holding the defendant liable notwithstanding the contributory
negligence of the plaintiff.]</p>

<p class='c019'>Of the same rule it was said in O’Brien <em>v.</em> McGlinchy, 68 Me. 552:</p>

<p class='c019'>“This rule applies usually in cases where the plaintiff or his property is in
some position of danger from a threatened contact with some agency under the
control of the defendant when the plaintiff cannot and the defendant can prevent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>an injury.... But this principle would not govern where both parties
are contemporaneously and actively in fault, and by their mutual carelessness
an injury ensues to one or both of them.” (Pages 557, 558.)</p>

<p class='c019'>In Smith <em>v.</em> Railroad, 114 N. C. 728, 19 S. E. 863, 25 L. R. A. 287, the general
rule was thus concretely stated:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“Applying the rule which we have stated to accidents upon railroad tracks,
it may be illustrated as follows: First, there must be a duty imposed upon the
engineer, as otherwise there can be no negligence to which the negligence of the
injured party is to contribute. The duty under consideration is to keep a vigilant
lookout&#160;... in order to discover and avoid injury to persons who may be
on the track and who are apparently in unconscious or helpless peril. When
such a person is on the track and the engineer fails to discover him in time to
avoid a collision, when he could have done so by the exercise of ordinary care,
the engineer is guilty of negligence. The decisive negligence of the engineer is
when he has reached that point when no effort on his part can avert the collision.
Hence, if A, being on the track and after this decisive negligence, fails
to look and listen and is in consequence run over and injured, his negligence is
not concurrent merely but really subsequent to that of the engineer, and he
cannot recover, as he and not the engineer has ‘the last clear opportunity of
avoiding the accident.’ If, however, A is on the track&#160;... and while there,
and before the decisive negligence of the engineer, he by his own negligence
becomes so entangled in the rails that he cannot extricate himself in time to
avoid the collision, and his helpless condition could have been discovered had
the engineer exercised ordinary care, then the negligence of A would be previous
to that of the engineer, and the engineer’s negligence would be the
proximate cause, he, and not A, having the last clear opportunity of avoiding
the injury. The same result would follow in the case of a wagon negligently
stalled, when no effort of the owner could remove it, and there are other cases
to which the principle is applicable.” (Pages 755, 756.)</p>

<p class='c019'>The principle running through these cases is reasonable and is consistent
with the general rules that have met with practically universal acceptance.
Applied to the facts of this case it requires an affirmance of the judgment.</p>

<p class='c019'>All the Justices concurring.</p>

<h5 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Baker, J.</span>, IN CLEVELAND R. CO. <em>v.</em> KLEE<br /> (1900) <cite>154 Indiana, 430, 434, 435.</cite></h5>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Baker, J.</span> It is alleged in the fifth paragraph: “That on or about the 22d
day of June, 1894, this plaintiff, a child nine years of age, was on the said crossing
of Georgia and Helen streets and upon said track of said defendant in said
Georgia Street; and while in said position and place, the defendant through
and by its said employees and servants, ran said locomotive against this plaintiff
and negligently dragged this plaintiff without fault or negligence on his
part, a long distance, to wit, two hundred feet; that the defendant knew that
it had run its locomotive against this plaintiff at said crossing; and knew that
it had knocked this plaintiff down in front of its said locomotive upon its said
track; and knew that this plaintiff was dragging in front of said locomotive on
said track; but that this defendant negligently failed to stop said locomotive
before this plaintiff was injured, although by the exercise of due care and caution
it could have stopped said locomotive before this plaintiff was injured;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>but negligently dragged this plaintiff as aforesaid, without fault or negligence
on the part of this plaintiff, and negligently injured this plaintiff in his body,
back, and limbs.” The injury for which compensation is sought in this paragraph
was not sustained in the collision at the crossing, but was wholly inflicted
after appellant knew that appellee was being dragged along the track in
front of the engine. By the exercise of due care appellant could have stopped
the engine before appellee was injured, but failed to do so. Appellee, after
being struck and while being dragged along the track, was free from fault contributing
to his injury. These allegations constitute a cause of action. Though
the paragraph confesses, by not denying, that appellee was guilty of negligence
in being upon the track, that negligence was only the remote condition, not
the proximate cause, of the injury complained of; for the injury resulted, after
the collision, entirely from occurrences in which it is alleged that appellant
was negligent and appellee was not.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>HOLMES <em>v.</em> MISSOURI PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Missouri, November 27, 1907.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 207 Missouri Reports, 149.</em></h5>

<p class='c022'>Action by C. W. Holmes and wife to recover for the death of their child,
F. G. Holmes. The child, eight years old, was struck and killed by a locomotive
engine at the crossing of an avenue. Two points in conflict were, whether
defendant was negligent, and whether the child was contributorily negligent.</p>

<p class='c019'>The following instruction was given at plaintiff’s request: “(4) If the jury
believe from the evidence that Freeborn G. Holmes was a boy of immature
age, and had not the capacity of an adult, and that he exercised such care as
ought reasonably to have been expected for one of his age and capacity, then
he was not guilty of contributory negligence.”</p>

<p class='c019'>To this instruction defendant excepted.</p>

<p class='c019'>An instruction given at the request of defendant was, that, if the child failed
to exercise such care and caution as an ordinarily prudent boy of his age and
capacity should have exercised under the circumstances, and by reason thereof
contributed to his own death, then your verdict must be for the defendant,
regardless of all other facts in the case.</p>

<p class='c019'>Verdict for plaintiff. Judgment for plaintiff in Circuit Court. Defendant
appealed.<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c015'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Valliant, J.</span>... In the brief for defendant, pages 61 and 139, the idea is
advanced that the only theory on which the plaintiffs’ judgment could be sustained
would be that the defendant is liable for the consequences of the reckless
conduct of the deceased child. That is a misconception of the theory on
which the defendant’s liability rests. The defendant is liable only for its own
negligence, and if its plea of contributory negligence is not sustained, still, it is
not charged with the consequence of the child’s negligence; but it is only not
excused thereby for the result of its own negligence. It is not always essential
to a plaintiff’s recovery, in an action for tort, that the evidence should show
that the accident was the result of the defendant’s negligence alone. A defendant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>may be liable if his negligence contributes with that of a third person
to produce the injury complained of; in such case he is not held liable for the
negligence of the third person, but only for his own negligence, without the
contributing force of which the negligence of the third person would not have
caused the injury. But the policy of the law is such that ordinarily a defendant
guilty of negligence is relieved from the liability for his own conduct if the
person injured was himself guilty of negligence that contributed to the result.
On that theory the defendant’s act is none the less negligent, and he is none the
less culpable, but the law will not allow a plaintiff to recover when he himself,
or the person for whose injury he sues, was also guilty of negligence contributing
with that of defendant to the result. There is reason and justice in that
policy of the law; it is an admonition to every one to exercise due care for his
own safety, and it authorizes another to presume that he will do so, and, so
presuming, adjust his own conduct. But common experience tells us that a
child may be too young and immature to observe the care necessary to his own
preservation and therefore when a person comes in contact with such a child,
if its youth and immaturity are obvious, he is chargeable with knowledge of
that fact and he cannot indulge the presumption that the child will do what is
necessary to avoid an impending danger. Therefore one seeing such a child in
such a position is guilty of negligence if he does not take into account the fact
that it is a child and regulate his own conduct accordingly.<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c015'><sup>[217]</sup></a> An act in relation
to a person of mature years might be free from the imputation of negligence
while an act of like character in view of a child would be blameworthy. Therefore
when the law says to the defendant although the act of the deceased child
contributed with your act to produce the result, yet, because of his youth and
immaturity, he is not adjudged guilty of negligence, it does not charge the defendant
with the consequence of the child’s conduct, but it only does not, for
that reason, excuse him for its [his] own negligence.</p>

<p class='c019'>If the defendant in such case had been guilty of no negligence there would
have been no accident.</p>

<p class='c022'>Plaintiff sued for the killing of his son, 6 years and 11 months old, who
was hit by a car at a street crossing.</p>

<p class='c019'>In the District Court, there was a verdict for plaintiff, and judgment

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Breaux, J.</span> [After stating the claims of both parties, and reciting the testimony
of plaintiff’s witnesses and of part of defendant’s witnesses.]</p>

<p class='c019'>The motorman and the conductor substantially testify that everything
was done to prevent the accident; that the boy darted in front of the car and,
that the motorman quickly stopped the car.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>After as careful and close an analysis of the evidence as it was possible for
us to make, we think that the weight of the testimony is with the defendant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Plaintiff’s theory that the little boy was standing on the track, between the
rails, and that the motorman ought to have seen him, is not sustained by the
evidence of his own witnesses; they do not testify, with any degree of certainty,
where he was just preceding the accident. The witnesses for the
defendant agree in stating that he was not on the track, and that the accident
was occasioned by the sudden act of the child.</p>

<p class='c019'>Granted as contended by the plaintiff that the motorman did not see the
child before he was knocked down by the fender: if the child had escaped his
attention, because of his sudden and unanticipated act itself, it becomes evident
that the defendant is not liable. Whether he was seen or was not seen by
the motorman would not render the defendant responsible, if owing to
thoughtless impulse of the child he brought about the accident by a sudden
act which could not be foreseen or guarded against by the motorman or any
one else in charge of the car.</p>

<p class='c019'>This brings us to the question of contributory negligence. Courts are
averse to finding children guilty of contributory negligence, and are readily
and properly inclined to disregard the thoughtlessness natural to boyhood, but
accidents may happen for which the unconscious agent may not be responsible.</p>

<p class='c019'>The fact that a child may not be capable of contributory negligence does
not always render a defendant liable upon the mere proof of the injury. The
test is negligence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vel non</span></i>. If the defendant or the defendant’s agent or employee
was not negligent, it is not liable.</p>

<p class='c019'>The only alternative, after the conclusion reached, is to set aside the verdict.</p>

<p class='c019'>The verdict and judgment are reversed, annulled and avoided.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>HUTCHINSON <em>v.</em> ST. LOUIS &amp; MERAMEC RIVER RAILROAD COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>St. Louis Court of Appeals, Missouri, April 9, 1901.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 88 Missouri Appeal Reports, 376.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Appeal from St. Louis City Circuit Court.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plaintiff (respondent) was injured while driving on the track of the
street railroad at the crossing of two streets. The car collided with
the rear of his wagon. Plaintiff testified that he had been driving for
some three hundred yards with the left wheels of his wagon inside the
north rail. Defendant’s (appellant’s) testimony tended to prove that
plaintiff did not drive on the track until he had either reached or was
near the crossing, and that he then turned and drove onto the track,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>when the motor car coming up from behind collided with the rear of
his wagon.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is undisputed is, that he did not look back to see if a car was
coming before attempting to cross, nor, according to his own testimony,
after he drove onto the track three hundred yards or more to
the east. He drove very slowly. There was testimony tending to
show the motorneer in charge of the car was watching a train on the
railroad just south of Manchester avenue, which inattention prevented
him from observing plaintiff’s perilous position until the car
was within twenty or thirty feet of the wagon. He was required by a
city ordinance, to be watching the track.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evidence as to the warning of the car’s approach was conflicting.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff was entitled to the use of the entire street, and, therefore,
was not a trespasser, while the defendant was entitled to the
right of way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Failure to signal the car’s approach was omitted from the instructions.
The only ground of recovery submitted to the jury was alleged
negligence of the defendant’s motorneer in not using ordinary care to
avoid injuring plaintiff after he knew, or by the proper care might have
known, the latter was in a dangerous position. One instruction was
given that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence if he failed
to look back at reasonable intervals to see if a car was coming and to
get off the track if he saw one. This was practically telling them he
was actually negligent, for he admitted he did not look back.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Goode, J.</span> The general principle on which the case was referred to
the jury, commonly styled the humane doctrine, is well supported by
authorities. It is accepted in some form in most of the state and federal
jurisdictions. So far as this court is concerned, the rule is no
longer debatable. All uncertainty about it being a substantive part
of the law of torts has been set at rest by recent deliberate pronouncements
of the Supreme Court. The authority of the rule is not impugned
by the learned counsel for the appellant, who only insist that
it is inapplicable to the cause in hand on account of the plaintiff’s
clear contributory negligence which continued to the moment of the
collision. This contention requires a brief examination of some cases
in which the doctrine has been applied. They divide into two classes
and the disputation which has raged over it has been on the border
line between the two. As enforced in one class, the rule has always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>seemed to the writer to be a phase of the doctrine of proximate cause,
consistent with the theory of the entire law of negligence and without
which the system would be incomplete. These instances are where
the plaintiff’s negligent act was detached from the injury so that the
defendant’s want of care was the sole active agency in inflicting it.
When an accident happens under such circumstances, the plaintiff
ought not to be refused a recovery because, though remiss, his fault
does not contribute to the injury. Illustrations of this class of cases
are numerous in the books, beginning with the one from which all the
others proceeded. Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, 10 Mees. &amp; W. 546, where the
plaintiff had carelessly fettered his beast in the highway and the defendant’s
servant drove over him. It is manifest that the original
negligence of the owner was separated from the injury, which was
proximately caused solely by the defendant’s tort. Another apt
illustration is found in the Reardon case (114 Mo. 384), where the
plaintiff carelessly went on the railway track and fell in endeavoring
to get off when he saw a train coming. It was held that if the engineer
failed to employ ordinary care to stop the train when he saw him
prostrate, the company was liable. The same ruling has been made in
actions where plaintiffs had fallen asleep on tracks or become fastened
in cattle guards or switches or where the person hurt was a child or
otherwise not of full legal capacity (Gabel <em>v.</em> Railway Co., 60 Mo.
475). The doctrine is exclusively met with, so far as our reading has
shown, in controversies arising from injuries due to violent impacts
and collisions. The above instances exemplify its use in such cases
where properly expounded, it does not clash with the doctrine of contributory
negligence, though some of the applications made have laid
it open to that charge. The reconciliation and harmonious working
of the two rules may be achieved by considering closely whether the
defendant’s carelessness was alone the proximate cause of the injury.
If only the defendant’s was the proximate cause, the plaintiff, while
guilty of negligence, was not guilty of contributory negligence; his
failure to use care did not proximately contribute to the mischief.
Time elapsed between his wrongful act and the injury, during which
the wrongful act of the defendant supervened or entered, as a separate
agency, which, by its own independent action, wrought the
unfortunate result. If, however, the plaintiff’s want of care continues
to the instant of the accident, or so near the instant as to be immediately
influential in producing it, he is as much to blame as the defendant,
and if the latter is compelled to compensate him, the theory
of the law of negligence is thus far abandoned. When it is deemed
expedient to allow a recovery under such circumstances, it must be
done as a measure of public policy. The rule then becomes, in fact,
an exception to the law of contributory negligence, as was said in
Kelly <em>v.</em> Railway Co., 101 Mo. 67. The real basis of it, as it obtains
in many jurisdictions in respect to injuries by cars and locomotives
when the injured individual was negligent to the very instant of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>collision, is to be sought, on an ultimate analysis, in its supposed
necessity for the public security. The guilt of the plaintiff is excused,
while that of the defendant is punished. In such instances, its administration
in cases of injuries by cars and engines is attended with
serious difficulty, viz.: determining when the employees of the railway
company may be justly said to have had notice that the injured
party was in a position of danger. Persons frequently remain on railway
tracks when a car or train is approaching, until it would be impossible
to stop it in time to avoid striking them, but easily get off
themselves in time. Accustomed to take care of their safety where
cars are constantly moving, they grow dexterous in avoiding them and
run risks. Engineers and motormen have a right to presume an individual
travelling on the track will leave it, and to act on that presumption
until his situation becomes alarming. Riley <em>v.</em> Railway Company,
68 Mo. App. 661. Just when this happens must often be largely conjectural,
which circumstance weighs heavily with many against the
rule in question.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine in its wider scope prevails in this State. The plaintiff
may recover, notwithstanding his negligence directly contributed to
his hurt, if the defendant by ordinary care could have prevented the
accident. In the Morgan case (60 S. W. Rep. 195), where a recovery
was sustained, this language is spoken: “There can be no doubt,
under the evidence, that the death of the plaintiff’s husband resulted
from the negligence of the defendant’s servants in charge of the train,
<em>and the negligence of the deceased himself contributing thereto</em>.” Similar
expositions have been made in many other cases. Schmidt <em>v.</em> R’y Co.,
50 S. W. 921; Klockenbrink <em>v.</em> Railway Co., 81 Mo. App. 351;
Cooney <em>v.</em> Railway Co., 80 Mo. App. 226. They seem in conflict with
the opinion in Hogan <em>v.</em> R’y Co., 150 Mo. 36. We must follow the
latest controlling decision. The Morgan case was decided in banc.</p>

<p class='c007'>In view of the strong utterances to be found in the foregoing authorities,
it is useless to descant on the wisdom or fallacy of the rule, to
explore its foundation, extol its justice, or regret its hardship. Our
unmistakable duty is to enforce it as we would any other part of the
law. The present case differs in no material respect, calling for its
application, from the Morgan or Cooney cases, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, which become
therefore controlling precedents. The Morgan case is stronger because
there the engineer did not see the deceased, who was flagrantly
careless, to the time the engine struck him; here the motorman did
not see the plaintiff. The court below did not err in refusing an
instruction to find the issue for the defendant, but rightly submitted
them. This practically disposes of the case.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Worden, J.</span> Action by the appellee against the appellant for assault
and battery. The complaint consisted of three paragraphs, a
demurrer to each of which, for want of sufficient facts, was overruled.
The first, the only one to which any specific objection is made in this
Court, alleged that the defendant, on, &amp;c., “violently and unlawfully
assaulted the plaintiff, and struck him, and also threw him, the plaintiff,
from the house of the defendant on to the street pavement, in
front of the defendant’s house, with great violence, fracturing,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant answered:—</p>

<p class='c007'><em>First.</em> [That there was a justifiable occasion for his use of force,
and that he used no more force than was necessary.]</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Second.</em> General denial.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff replied by general denial to the first paragraph of the
answer. Trial by jury, verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for
$500.</p>

<p class='c007'>The counsel for the appellant in their brief say: “We shall not stop
now to discuss the merits of the complaint further than to say that the
first paragraph of the complaint shows an eviction from the defendant’s
premises, and we have thought that the paragraph should aver
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>that the injury occurred without the fault of the plaintiff.” The paragraph
does not charge an injury to the plaintiff arising out of the
negligence of the defendant, but an unlawful assault upon, and battery
of, the plaintiff’s person. In such cases it is not necessary to
allege that the plaintiff was without fault, or, in other words, was not
guilty of contributory negligence. There remains nothing more to be
considered except such questions as arise on a motion for a new trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Omitting part of opinion.]</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant asked that the following interrogatory be answered
by the jury, if they should return a general verdict, viz.: “Did the
fault or negligence of the plaintiff contribute in any way to the injury
of the plaintiff, received on the evening of the 3d of March, 1876?”
The Court declined to direct the jury to answer the interrogatory, and
in this we think no error was committed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The right of the plaintiff to recover depended not upon any negligence
of the defendant, but upon the assault and battery, which, if
perpetrated at all by the defendant, was intentional and purposed. It
may be that the defendant did not intend to inflict so severe an injury
upon the plaintiff as seemed to result from the excess of force applied
by him; but it does not therefore follow that he did not intend to
apply that force.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine that contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff
will defeat his action has been generally applied in actions based
on the negligence of the defendant, in short, in cases involving mutual
negligence. But it has also been applied in some cases where the matter
complained of was not negligence merely, but the commission of
some act in itself unlawful, without reference to the manner of committing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>it, as the wilful and unauthorized obstruction of a highway,
whereby a person is injured. Butterfield <em>v.</em> Forrester, 11 East, 60;
Dygert <em>v.</em> Schenck, 23 Wend. 446.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine, however, can have no application to the case of an
intentional and unlawful assault and battery, for the reason that the
person thus assaulted is under no obligation to exercise any care to
avoid the same by retreating or otherwise, and for the further reason
that his want of care can in no just sense be said to contribute to the
injury inflicted upon him by such assault and battery.</p>

<p class='c007'>An intentional and unlawful assault and battery inflicted upon a
person is an invasion of his right of personal security, for which the
law gives him redress, and of this redress he cannot be deprived on the
ground that he was negligent and took no care to avoid such invasion
of his right.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trespass was purposely committed by the defendant. If he
could excuse it on the ground of the alleged misconduct of the plaintiff,
and if he employed no more force than was necessary and reasonable,
that was a complete defence. Otherwise the plaintiff, if he
made out the trespass, was entitled to recover, and no negligence on
his part, as before observed, could defeat his action. The case of
Ruter <em>v.</em> Foy, 46 Iowa, 132, is in point. There the plaintiff alleged
that the defendant had assaulted and beat her with a pitchfork. On
the trial the defendant asked, but the Court refused, the following instruction:
“If you find from the evidence that the plaintiff was
injured, or contributed to her injury, by her own act or negligence,
defendant would not be liable for assault and battery upon her, and
plaintiff cannot recover.” On appeal the Court said upon this point:
“The doctrine of contributory negligence has no application in an
action for assault and battery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The case here is entirely unlike that of Brown <em>v.</em> Kendall, 6 Cush.
292. There the defendant’s dog and another were fighting. The
defendant was beating the dogs with a stick in order to separate them,
in doing which he accidentally hit the plaintiff in the eye with the
stick. It was held that trespass <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi et armis</span></i> was the proper form of
action, because the injury to the plaintiff was immediate; but that as
the parting of the dogs was a proper and lawful act, and as the hitting
of the plaintiff was not intentional, but a mere accident or casualty,
the plaintiff could not recover at all without showing a want of ordinary
care on the part of the defendant; and then that contributory
negligence on the part of the plaintiff would defeat the action.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although, according to the common-law system of pleading, trespass
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi et armis</span></i> was the proper form of action in such case, the essential
and only ground on which the action could rest was the negligence
of the defendant in doing an act lawful in itself whereby the plaintiff

<h5 class='c013'>AIKEN <em>v.</em> HOLYOKE STREET RAILWAY CO.<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, October 21, 1903.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 184 Massachusetts Reports, 269.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Tort by an infant against a street railway company for personal
injuries. Writ dated July 6, 1898.</p>

<p class='c007'>At a previous stage of this case, reported in 180 Mass. 8, the plaintiff’s
exceptions were sustained by this court after a verdict had been
ordered in the Superior Court for the defendant. At the new trial in
the Superior Court before Lawton, J., the jury returned a verdict for
the plaintiff in the sum of $5000. The defendant alleged exceptions,
raising the questions stated by the court.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Knowlton, C. J.</span> The most important question in this case grows
out of the instructions to the jury upon the third count. This count
charges the defendant, by its servants, with having started up the car
recklessly, wantonly and with gross disregard of the plaintiff’s safety,
while he was in a place of great peril upon the step of the car, and
with having thrown him upon the ground and under the wheels of the
car. There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff, a boy six
and one half years of age, ran near or against the car, and was upon
the lower step at the forward end as the car was going around a curve
from one street into another, and was clinging to the step trying to
get into a stable position, and that he there cried out to the motorman,
“Let me off”; that the motorman saw and heard him and knew that
he was in a place of danger, and that he then turned on the power in
a wanton and reckless way, with a view to start the car quickly, and
that the plaintiff was thus thrown off and injured. This testimony
was contradicted, but it was proper for the consideration of the jury.
The judge instructed the jury that if they found the facts to be in accordance
with this contention of the plaintiff, they would be warranted
in finding that the conduct of the motorman was wanton and reckless,
and in returning a verdict for the plaintiff. He also instructed them
that to maintain the action on this ground, it must be proved that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>motorman wilfully and intentionally turned on the power, with a view
to making the car start forward rapidly and go at full speed quickly,
but that it was not necessary to prove that he did this with the intention
of throwing the boy off and injuring him. He also told them that
to warrant a recovery upon this state of facts, the plaintiff need not
show that he was in the exercise of due care. The defendant excepted
to that part of the instruction which relates to due care on the part of
the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant contends that while it was not necessary for the
plaintiff to show due care anterior to the act of the motorman, he was
bound to show due care which was concurrent with this act and immediately
subsequent to it. This brings us to a consideration of the
rules and principles applicable to this kind of liability. It is familiar
law that in the absence of a statutory provision, mere negligence,
whatever its degree, if it does not include culpability different in kind
from that of ordinary negligence, does not create a liability in favor
of one injured by it, if his own negligence contributes to his injury.
It is equally true that one who wilfully and wantonly, in reckless disregard
of the rights of others, by a positive act or careless omission
exposes another to death or grave bodily injury, is liable for the consequences,
even if the other was guilty of negligence or other fault in
connection with the causes which led to the injury. The difference
in rules applicable to the two classes of cases results from the difference
in the nature of the conduct of the wrong-doers in the two kinds
of cases. In the first case the wrong-doer is guilty of nothing worse
than carelessness. In the last he is guilty of a wilful, intentional
wrong. His conduct is criminal or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi</span></i> criminal. If it results in the
death of the injured person, he is guilty of manslaughter. Commonwealth
<em>v.</em> Pierce, 138 Mass. 165; Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Hartwell, 128
Mass. 415. The law is regardful of human life and personal safety,
and if one is grossly and wantonly reckless in exposing others to
danger, it holds him to have intended the natural consequences of his
act, and treats him as guilty of a wilful and intentional wrong. It is
no defence to a charge of manslaughter for the defendant to show
that, while grossly reckless, he did not actually intend to cause the
death of his victim. In these cases of personal injury there is a constructive
intention as to the consequences, which, entering into the
wilful, intentional act, the law imputes to the offender, and in this
way a charge which otherwise would be mere negligence, becomes,
by reason of a reckless disregard of probable consequences, a wilful
wrong. That this constructive intention to do an injury in such cases
will be imputed in the absence of an actual intent to harm a particular
person, is recognized as an elementary principle in criminal law. It
is also recognized in civil actions for recklessly and wantonly injuring
others by carelessness. Palmer <em>v.</em> Chicago, St. Louis &amp; Pittsburgh
Railroad, 112 Ind. 250; Shumacher <em>v.</em> St. Louis &amp; San Francisco
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>Railroad, 39 Fed. Rep. 174; Brannen <em>v.</em> Kokomo, Greentown &amp;
Jerome Gravel Road Co., 115 Ind. 115. In an action to recover
damages for an assault and battery, it would be illogical and absurd
to allow as a defence, proof that the plaintiff did not use proper care
to avert the blow. See Sanford <em>v.</em> Eighth Avenue Railroad, 23 N. Y.
343, 346. It would be hardly less so to allow a similar defence where
a different kind of injury was wantonly and recklessly inflicted. A
reason for the rule is the fact that if a wilful, intentional wrong is
shown to be the direct and proximate cause of an injury, it is hardly
conceivable that any lack of care on the part of the injured person
could so concur with the wrong as also to be a direct and proximate
contributing cause to the injury. It might be a condition without
which the injury could not be inflicted. See Newcomb <em>v.</em> Boston
Protective Department, 146 Mass. 596. It might be a remote cause,
but it hardly could be a cause acting directly and proximately with
the intentional wrongful act of the offender. Judson <em>v.</em> Great Northern
Railway, 63 Minn. 248, 255. The offence supposed is different in
kind from the plaintiff’s lack of ordinary care. It is criminal or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi</span></i>
criminal. Not only is it difficult to conceive of a plaintiff’s negligence
as being another direct and proximate cause foreign to the first, yet
acting directly with it, but it would be unjust to allow one to relieve
himself from the direct consequences of a wilful wrong by showing
that a mere lack of due care in another contributed to the result. The
reasons for the rule as to the plaintiff’s care in actions for ordinary
negligence are wanting, and at the same time the facts make the rule
impossible of application. The general rule that the plaintiff’s failure
to exercise ordinary care for his safety, is not a good defence to an
action for wanton and wilful injury caused by a reckless omission of
duty, has been recognized in many decisions, as well as by writers of
text-books. Aiken <em>v.</em> Holyoke Street Railway, 180 Mass. 8, 14, 15;
Wallace <em>v.</em> Merrimack River Navigation &amp; Express Co., 134 Mass.
95; Banks <em>v.</em> Highland Street Railway, 136 Mass. 485, 486; Palmer
<em>v.</em> Chicago, St. Louis &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad, 112 Ind. 250; Brannen
<em>v.</em> Kokomo, Greentown &amp; Jerome Gravel Road Co., 115 Ind. 115;
Florida Southern Railway <em>v.</em> Hirst, 30 Fla. 1; Shumacher <em>v.</em> St. Louis
&amp; San Francisco Railroad, 39 Fed. Rep. 174; 7 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of
Law (2d ed.) 443 and note; Beach, Contr. Neg. (3d ed.) §§ 46, 50, 64,
65; Wood, Railroads (2d ed.), 1452; Elliott, Railroads, § 1175;
Thompson, Neg. § 206; Cooley, Torts (2d ed.), 810. We have been
referred to no case in which it is held that it makes any difference
whether the plaintiff’s lack of ordinary care is only previous to the
defendant’s wrong and continuing to the time of it, or whether there
is such a lack after the wrong begins to take effect. It is difficult to
see how there can be any difference in principle between the two cases.
In this Commonwealth, as in most other jurisdictions, liability does
not depend upon which of different causes contributing to an injury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>is latest in the time of its origin, but upon which is the direct, active,
efficient cause, as distinguished from a remote cause, in producing
the result.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are expressions in some of the cases which imply the possibility
of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff in a case of
wanton and reckless injury by a defendant. If there is a conceivable
case in which a plaintiff’s want of due care may directly and proximately
contribute as a cause of an injury inflicted directly and proximately
by the wilful wrong of another, such a want of care must be
something different from the mere want of ordinary care to avoid an
injury coming in a usual way. There is nothing to indicate the existence
of peculiar conditions of this kind in the present case. Conduct
of a plaintiff which would be negligence precluding recovery if the
injury were caused by ordinary negligence of a defendant, will not
commonly preclude recovery if the injury is inflicted wilfully through
wanton carelessness. This is illustrated by the former decision in this
case and by many others. Aiken <em>v.</em> Holyoke Street Railway, 180 Mass.
8; McKeon <em>v.</em> New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, 183
Mass. 271. As to this kind of liability of the defendant, it was certainly
proper to instruct the jury that, in reference to ordinary kinds
of care to avoid an injury from a car, the plaintiff need not show that
he was in the exercise of due care if a lack of such care would have
no tendency to cause the wilful and wanton injury. The fair interpretation
of the instruction given is, that it referred to ordinary kinds
of care to avoid an injury from an electric car. On this branch of the
case there seems to have been no reason for an instruction in regard
to any special care, and probably neither counsel nor the court had
any care in mind except that, in reference to which, in any view of
the law, the instruction was properly given. We are of opinion that
the ruling excepted to was correct.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>BANKS <em>v.</em> BRAMAN<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, June 20, 1905.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 188 Massachusetts Reports, 367.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Tort, for injuries from being struck by an automobile driven by the
defendant on Mount Auburn Street in Cambridge near its intersection
with Belmont Street shortly after eight o’clock on the evening of May
17, 1903. Writ dated November 18, 1903.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>At the trial in the Superior Court before Aiken, C. J., the jury
returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $3750; and the
defendant alleged exceptions, raising the questions stated by the court.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Knowlton, C. J.</span> This is an action to recover for injuries received
from being struck by an automobile alleged to have been negligently
run at an excessive rate of speed, and negligently managed by the defendant.
The case was submitted to the jury on two alleged grounds
of liability: one, that the defendant, with gross negligence, wantonly
and recklessly injured the plaintiff, and the other that the plaintiff
was in the exercise of due care, and that the injury was due to the defendant’s
negligence. On the first claim the judge instructed the jury
as follows: “Gross negligence is great negligence. To make out the
proposition of gross negligence, you must be satisfied that the way the
machine was operated by Braman was reckless, was careless to the degree
of recklessness; that it was run with a reckless disregard to the
rights of Banks in this street. If that is established, namely, that there
was a reckless disregard of the rights of Banks in the way this machine
was run, then Banks is not required to show that he was himself
in the exercise of due care. If the way—I repeat this for the purpose
of plainness perhaps unnecessarily—if the manner in which the
machine—the automobile, I mean by the machine—was run on the
occasion of this accident was such that it was grossly negligent, that
is, careless to such a degree that you can say it was reckless, using
your common sense and judgment, and applying them to the evidence,
then Banks is not required to show that he was in the exercise of due
care; because if the defendant’s carelessness was gross in the sense
that has been defined to you, there is an obligation to pay damages
independent of the matter of due care.” The defendant excepted to
this instruction. The jury were instructed as to the liability for a failure
to exercise ordinary care, but there was no fuller statement of the
law on this branch of the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question is whether the difference between the two kinds of liability
was sufficiently pointed out to give the jury an adequate understanding
of it. The difference in culpability of the defendant, which
distinguishes these different kinds of liability, is something more than
a mere difference in the degree of inadvertence. In one case there
need be nothing more than a lack of ordinary care, which causes an
injury to another. In the other case there is wilful, intentional conduct
whose tendency to injure is known, or ought to be known, accompanied
by a wanton and reckless disregard of the probable harmful
consequences from which others are likely to suffer, so that the whole
conduct together, is of the nature of a wilful, intentional wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Here the learned judge quoted at length from Aiken <em>v.</em> Holyoke
Street Railway, 184 Mass. 269, 271.]</p>

<p class='c007'>In dealing with the same subject in Bjornquist <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Albany
Railroad, 185 Mass. 130, 134, the court said: “The conduct which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>creates a liability to a trespasser in cases of this kind has been referred
to in the books in a variety of ways. Sometimes it has been
called gross negligence and sometimes wilful negligence. Plainly it is
something more than is necessary to constitute the gross negligence
referred to in our statutes and in decisions of this court. The term
‘wilful negligence’ is not a strictly accurate description of the wrong.
But wanton and reckless negligence in this class of cases includes
something more than ordinary inadvertence. In its essence it is like
a wilful, intentional wrong. It is illustrated by an act which otherwise
might be unobjectionable, but which is liable or likely to do great
harm, and which is done in a wanton and reckless disregard of the
probable injurious consequences.” The ground on which it is held
that, when an act of the defendant shows an injury inflicted in this
way, the plaintiff need introduce no affirmative evidence of due care,
is that such a wrong is a cause so independent of previous conduct of
the plaintiff, which, in a general sense, may fall short of due care, that
this previous conduct cannot be considered a directly contributing
cause of the injury, and, in reference to such an injury, the plaintiff,
without introducing evidence, is assumed to be in a position to claim
his rights and to have compensation. So far as the cause of his injury
is concerned, he is in the position of one who exercises due care.
Aiken <em>v.</em> Holyoke Street Railway, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not easy to explain to a jury the nature of this liability. What
was said by the judge in this case comes very near to a correct statement
of the law. But it lacks something in fulness, and we think the
jury may have understood that negligence somewhat greater in degree
than a mere lack of ordinary care or a simple inadvertence, but not
different from it in kind, would constitute the gross negligence referred
to. We are of opinion that when there is an attempt to establish
this peculiar kind of liability, which exists independently of a
general exercise of due care by the plaintiff, the jury should be instructed
with such fulness as to enable them to know that they are
dealing with a wrong materially different in kind from ordinary negligence.
Because we think the instruction may have left the jury with
a misunderstanding of the law, the exceptions are sustained.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are of opinion that there was evidence which justified the submission
of the case to the jury on this ground, as well as on the
ground that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>McClellan, J.</span><a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c015'><sup>[224]</sup></a>&#160;... Many of the rulings of the trial court in defining the
gross negligence, recklessness or wantonness on the part of the defendant,
which will authorize recovery, notwithstanding plaintiff’s contributory negligence,
are presented for review. The fault in the court’s definitions in this regard
lies, in our opinion, in the assumption that recklessness or wantonness
implying wilful and intentional wrong-doing may be predicated of a mere
omission of duty, under circumstances which do not, of themselves, impute to
the person so failing to discharge the duty a sense of the probable consequences
of the omission. The charges given by the court in this connection, and its
rulings on charges requested by the defendant, proceed on the theory that a
mere failure on the part of defendant’s employees to see plaintiff’s wagon and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>team as soon as they might have seen them by the exercise of due care was
such recklessness or wantonness as implies a willingness or a purpose on their
part to inflict the injury complained of. We do not think this proposition can
be maintained either logically or upon the authorities. The failure to keep a
lookout, which it was the duty of defendant’s employees to maintain, and
which would have sooner disclosed the peril of the driver and plaintiff’s
wagon and team—even conceding that such would have been the case—was,
at the most, mere negligence, inattention, inadvertence; and it cannot
be conceived, in the nature of things, how a purpose to accomplish a given
result can be imputed to mental conditions, the very essence of which is the
absence of all thought on the particular subject. To say that one intends a
result which springs solely from his mind not addressing itself to the factors
which conduce to it, to imply a purpose to do a thing from inadvertence in
respect of it, are contradictions in terms. Wilful and intentional wrong, a
willingness to inflict injury, cannot be imputed to one who is without consciousness,
from whatever cause, that his conduct will inevitably or probably
lead to wrong and injury. In the case at bar, this consciousness could not
exist on the part of defendant’s employees until they knew plaintiff’s wagon
and team were in a position of danger; and no degree of ignorance on their
part of this state of things, however reprehensible in itself, could supply this
element of conscious wrong, or reckless indifference to consequences, which,
from their point of view, would probably or necessarily ensue.</p>

<p class='c019'>The true doctrine, and that supported by many decisions of this court, as
well as the great weight of authority in other jurisdictions, is that notwithstanding
plaintiff’s contributory negligence he may yet recover, if, in a case
like this, the defendant’s employees <em>discover the perilous situation in time to
prevent disaster by the exercise of due care and diligence, and fail, after the peril
of plaintiff’s property becomes known to them as a fact</em>—and not merely after
they should have known it—<em>to resort to all reasonable effort to avoid the injury</em>.
Such failure, with such knowledge of the situation and the probable consequences
of the omission to act upon the dictates of prudence and diligence to
the end of neutralizing plaintiff’s fault and averting disaster, notwithstanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>his lack of care, is, strictly speaking, not <em>negligence</em> at all, though the term
“gross negligence” has been so frequently used as defining it that it is perhaps
too late, if otherwise desirable, to eradicate what is said to be an unscientific
definition, if not indeed a misnomer; but it is more than any degree
of negligence, inattention or inadvertence—which can never mean other than
the omission of action without intent, existing or imputed, to commit wrong—it
is that recklessness, or wantonness, or worse, which implies a willingness
to inflict the impending injury, or a wilfulness in pursuing a course of conduct
which will naturally or probably result in disaster, or an intent to perpetrate
wrong. The theory of contributory negligence, as a defence, is that, conjointly
with <em>negligence</em> on the part of the defendant, it conduces to the damnifying
result, and defeats any action, the <em>gravamen</em> of which is such negligence.
If defendant’s conduct is not merely negligent, but worse, there is nothing for
plaintiff’s want of care to contribute to—there is no lack of mere prudence
and diligence of like kind on the part of defendant to conjunctively constitute
the efficient cause. Mere negligence on the one hand cannot be said to aid
wilfulness on the other. And hence such negligence of a plaintiff is no defence
against the consequences of the wilfulness of the defendant. But nothing
short of the elements of actual knowledge of the situation on the part of
defendant’s employees, and their omission of preventive effort after that
knowledge is brought home to them, when there is reasonable prospect that
such effort will avail, will suffice to avoid the defence of contributory negligence
on the part of, or imputable to, the plaintiff.</p>

&amp;c., by a fire alleged to have originated in the negligence of the railway
company. Fire was communicated by sparks from railroad

on defendant’s land, on both sides of the track; and thence the fire
passed upon plaintiff’s land where dry grass and weeds had also been
permitted to accumulate. A strong wind was blowing from the track
toward plaintiff’s buildings, about one hundred and forty rods distant.
The dry and combustible matter on the railroad land and on

<p class='c007'>Trial; verdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c015'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dixon, C. J.</span> All the authorities agree that the presence of dry
grass and other inflammable material upon the way of a railroad, suffered
to remain there by the company without cause, is a fact from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>which the jury may find negligence against the company. The cases in
Illinois, cited and relied upon by counsel for the defendant, hold this.
They hold that it is proper evidence for the jury, who may find negligence
from it, although it is not negligence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. Railroad Co. <em>v.</em>
Shanefelt, 47 Ill. 497; Illinois Central Railroad Co. <em>v.</em> Nunn, 51 id.
78; Railroad Co. <em>v.</em> Mills, 42 id. 407; Bass <em>v.</em> Railroad Co., 28 id. 9.
The Court below ruled in the same way, and left it for the jury to say
whether the suffering of the combustible material to accumulate upon
the right of way and sides of the track, or the failure to remove the
same, if the jury so found, was or was not, under the circumstances,
negligence on the part of the company. No fault can be found with the
instructions in this respect; and the next question is as to the charge
of the Court, and its refusal to charge, respecting the alleged negligence
of the plaintiff contributing, as it is said, to the loss or damage
complained of. This is the leading and most important question
in the case. It is a question upon which there is some conflict of
authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts were, that the plaintiff had permitted the weeds, grass,
and stubble, to remain upon his own land immediately adjoining the
railway of the defendant. They were dry and combustible, the same
as the weeds and grass upon the right of way, though less in quantity,
because within the right of way no mowing had ever been done, and
the growth was more luxuriant and heavy. The plaintiff had not cut
and removed the grass and weeds from his own land, nor ploughed in
or removed the stubble, so as to prevent the spread of fire in case the
same should be communicated to the dry grass and weeds upon the
railroad, from the engines operated by the defendant. The grass,
weeds, and stubble, upon the plaintiff’s land, together with the wind,
which was blowing pretty strongly in that direction, served to carry
the fire to the stacks, buildings, and other property of the plaintiff,
which were destroyed by it, and which were situated some distance
from the railroad. The fire originated within the line of the railroad,
and near the track, upon the land of the defendant. It was communicated
to the dry grass and other combustible material there, by
coals of fire dropped from an engine of the defendant passing over
the road. The evidence tends very clearly to establish these facts,
and under the instructions the jury must have so found. The plaintiff
is a farmer, and, in the particulars here in controversy, conducted
his farming operations the same as other farmers throughout the
country. It is not the custom anywhere for farmers to remove the
grass or weeds from their waste lands, or to plough in or remove their
stubble, in order to prevent the spread of the fire originating from such
causes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this question, as upon the others, the Court charged the jury
that it was for them to say whether the plaintiff was guilty of negligence,
and, if they found he was, that then he could not recover. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>the other hand, the defendant asked an instruction to the effect that it
was negligence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i> for the plaintiff to leave the grass, weeds, and
stubble upon his own land, exposed to the fire which might be communicated
to them from the burning grass and weeds on the defendant’s
right of way, and that for this reason there could be no recovery on the
part of the plaintiff. The Court refused to give the instruction, and, I
think, rightly. The charge upon this point, as well as upon the other,
was quite as favorable to the defendant as the law will permit, and
even more so than some of the authorities will justify. The authorities
upon this point are, as I have said, somewhat in conflict. The two
cases first above cited from Illinois hold that it is negligence on the
part of the adjoining landowner not to remove the dry grass and combustible
material from his own land under such circumstances, and
that he cannot recover damages where the loss is by fire thus communicated.
Those decisions were by a divided Court, by two only of the
three judges composing it. They rest upon no satisfactory grounds,
whilst the reasons found in the opinions of the dissenting judge are
very strong to the contrary. Opposed to these are the unanimous
decisions of the courts of New York, and of the English Court of
Exchequer, upon the identical point. Cook <em>v.</em> Champlain Transportation
Co., 1 Denio, 91; Vaughan <em>v.</em> Taff Vale Railway Co., 3
Hurl. and Nor. 743; Same <em>v.</em> Same, 5 id. 679. These decisions,
though made many years before the Illinois cases arose, are not referred
to in them. The last was the same case on appeal in the
Exchequer Chamber, where, although the judgment was reversed,
it was upon another point. This one was not questioned, but was
affirmed, as will be seen from the opinions of the judges, particularly
of Cockburn, C. J., and Willes, J. The reasoning of those cases is,
in my judgment, unanswerable. I do not see that I can add anything
to it. They show that the doctrine of contributory negligence is
wholly inapplicable,—that no man is to be charged with negligence
because he uses his own property or conducts his own affairs as other
people do theirs, or because he does not change or abandon such use,
and modify the management of his affairs, so as to accommodate
himself to the negligent habits or gross misconduct of others, and in
order that such others may escape the consequences of their own
wrong, and continue in the practice of such negligence or misconduct.
In other words, they show that no man is to be deprived of the free,
ordinary, and proper use of his own property by reason of the negligent
use which his neighbor may make of his. He is not his neighbor’s
guardian or keeper, and not to answer for his neglect. The case put
by the Court of New York, of the owner of a lot who builds upon it
in close proximity to the shop of a smith, is an apt illustration. Or
let us suppose that A. and B. are proprietors of adjoining lands. A.
has a dwelling-house, barns, and other buildings upon his, and cultivates
some portion of it. B. has a planing mill, or other similar manufacturing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>establishment upon his, near the line of A., operated by
steam. B. is a careless man, habitually so, and suffers shavings and
other inflammable material to accumulate about his mills and up to
the line of A., and so near to the fire in the mill that the same is liable
at any time to be ignited. A. knows this, and remonstrates with B.,
but B. persists. Upon A.’s land, immediately adjoining the premises
of B., it is unavoidable, in the ordinary course of husbandry, or of
A.’s use of the land, that there should be at certain seasons of the
year, unless A. removes them, dry grass and stubble, which, when set
fire to, will endanger his dwelling-house and other property of a combustible
nature, especially with the wind blowing in a particular
direction at the time. It may be a very considerable annual expense
and trouble to A. to remove them. It may require considerable time
and labor, a useless expenditure to him, diverting his attention from
other affairs and duties. The constant watching to guard against the
carelessness and negligence of B. is a great tax upon his time and
patience. The question is: Does the law require this of him, lest, in
some unguarded moment, the fire should break out, his property be
destroyed, and he be remediless? If the law does so require, if it imposes
on him the duty of guarding against B.’s negligence, and of
seeing that no injury shall come from it, or, if it does come, that it
shall be his fault and not B.’s, it is important to know upon what principle
it is that the burden is thus shifted from B. to himself. I know
of no such principle, and doubt whether any Court could be found
deliberately to announce or affirm it. And yet such is the result of
holding the doctrine of contributory negligence applicable to such a
case. A. is compelled, all his lifetime, at much expense and trouble,
to watch and guard against the negligence of B., and to prevent any
injuries arising from it, and for what? Simply that B. may continue
to indulge in such negligence at his pleasure. And he does so with
impunity. The law affords no redress against him. If the property is
destroyed, it is because of the combustible material on A.’s land, which
carries the fire, and which is A.’s fault, and A. is the loser. No loss can
ever possibly overtake him. A. is responsible for the negligence, but
not he himself. He kindles the fire, and A. stands guard over it. He
sets the dangerous element in motion, and uses and operates it for his
own benefit and advantage, negligently as he pleases, whilst A., with
sleepless vigilance, sees to it that no damage is done, or if there is,
that he will be the sufferer. This is the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</span></i> of applying
the doctrine of contributory negligence in such a case. And it is
absurd, I care not by what Court or where applied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the case of a railroad company is like the case of an individual.
Both stand on the same footing with respect to their rights and liabilities.
Both are engaged in the pursuit of a lawful business, and are
alike liable for damage or injury caused by their negligence in the
prosecution of it. Fire is an agent of an exceedingly dangerous and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>unruly kind, and, though applied to a lawful purpose, the law requires
the utmost care in the use of all reasonable and proper means to prevent
damage to the property of third persons. This obligation of
care, the want of which constitutes negligence according to the circumstances,
is imposed upon the party who uses the fire, and not upon
those persons whose property is exposed to danger by reason of the
negligence of such party. Third persons are merely passive, and have
the right to remain so, using and enjoying their own property as they
will, so far as responsibility for the negligence of the party setting the
unruly and destructive agent in motion is concerned. If he is negligent,
and damage ensues, it is his fault and cannot be theirs, unless
they contribute to it by some unlawful or improper act. But the use
of their own property as best suits their own convenience and purposes,
or as other people use theirs, is not unlawful or improper. It
is perfectly lawful and proper, and no blame can attach to them. He
cannot, by his negligence, deprive them of such use, or say to them,
“Do this or that with your property, or I will destroy it by the negligent
and improper use of my fire.” The fault, therefore, in both a
legal and moral point of view, is with him, and it would be something
strange should the law visit all the consequences of it upon them. The
law does not do so, and it is an utter perversion of the maxim <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic
utere tuo, etc.</span></i>, thus to apply it to the persons whose property is so
destroyed by the negligence of another. It is changing it from “So
use your own as not to injure another’s property,” to “So use your
own that another shall not injure your property,” by his carelessness
and negligence. It would be a very great burden to lay upon all the
farmers and proprietors of lands along our extensive lines of railway,
were it to be held that they are bound to guard against the negligence
of the companies in this way,—that the law imposes this duty upon
them. Always burdensome and difficult, it would, in numerous instances,
be attended with great expense and trouble. Changes would
have to be made in the mode of use and occupation, and sometimes
the use abandoned, or at least all profitable use. Houses and buildings
would have to be removed, and valuable timber cut down and
destroyed. These are, in general, very combustible, especially at
particular seasons of the year. The presence of these along or near
the line of the railroad would be negligence in the farmer or proprietor.
In the event of their destruction by the negligence of the
company, he would be remediless. He must remove them, therefore,
for his own safety. His only security consists in that. He must remove
everything combustible from his own land in order that the
company may leave all things combustible on its land and exposed
without fear of loss or danger to the company to being ignited at any
moment by the fires from its own engines. If this duty is imposed
upon the farmers and other proprietors of adjoining lands, why not
require them to go at once to the railroad and remove the dry grass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>and other inflammable material there? There is the origin of the
mischief, and there the place to provide securities against it. It is
vastly easier, by a few slight measures and a little precaution, to prevent
the conflagration in the first place than to stay its ravages when
it has once begun, particularly if the wind be blowing at the time, as
it generally is upon our open prairies. With comparatively little
trouble and expense upon the road itself, a little labor bestowed for
that purpose, the mischief might be remedied. And this is an additional
reason why the burden ought not to be shifted from the company
upon the proprietor of the adjoining land; although, if it were
otherwise, it certainly would not change what ought to be the clear
rule of law upon the subject.</p>

Action for Negligence (A. 6).</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that some of these cases arose under statutes creating a
liability on the part of railroad companies, but that does not affect the
principle. Negligence in the plaintiff, contributing to the loss, is a
defence to an action under the statutes, the same as to an action at
common law. 8 Allen, 440; 6 id. 87.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendants moved for a rehearing.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dixon, C. J.</span> (Sept. 21, 1871.)...</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned counsel&#160;... argue that, if logically carried out, the
doctrine would utterly abrogate the rule that a party cannot recover
damages where, by the exercise of ordinary care, he could have avoided
the injury; and so, in the present case, after discovering the fire, the
plaintiff might have leaned on his plough-handles and watched its
progress, without effort to stay it, where such effort would have been
effectual, and yet have been free from culpable negligence. The distinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>is between a known, present, or immediate danger, arising
from the negligence of another,—that which is imminent and certain,
unless the party does or omits to do some act by which it may
be avoided,—and a danger arising in like manner, but which is remote
and possible or probable only, or contingent and uncertain, depending
on the course of future events, such as the future conduct of
the negligent party, and other as yet unknown and fortuitous circumstances.
The difference is that between realization and anticipation.
A man in his senses, in face of what has been aptly termed a “seen
danger” (Shearman and Redfield, § 34, note 1), that is, one which
presently threatens and is known to him, is bound to realize it, and to
use all proper care and make all reasonable efforts to avoid it, and if he
does not, it is his own fault; and he having thus contributed to his
own loss or injury, no damage can be recovered from the other party,
however negligent the latter may have been. But, in case of a danger
of the other kind, one which is not “seen,” but exists in anticipation
merely, and where the injury may or may not accrue, but is probable
or possible only from the continued culpable negligence of another,
there the law imposes no such duty upon the person who is or may be
so exposed, and he is not obliged to change his conduct or the mode
of transacting his affairs, which are otherwise prudent and proper, in
order to avoid such anticipated injuries or prevent the mischiefs which
may happen through another’s default and culpable want of care.</p>

  <h5 class='c013'>THE BERNINA<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Court of Appeal, January 24, 1887.</span><br /> <em>Reported in Law Reports, 12 Probate Division, 58.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Appeal from a judgment of Butt, J. (in the Probate, Divorce, and
Admiralty Division, reported in 11 Prob. Div. 31), on a special case
stated for the opinion of the Court, in three actions brought <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in personam</span></i>
against the owners of the steamer Bernina.</p>

<p class='c007'>Butt, J., held, on the authority of Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, 8 C. B. 115,
that the plaintiffs were unable to recover against the defendants, and
dismissed the actions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiffs appealed.<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c015'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lindley, L. J.</span> This was a special case. Three actions are brought
in the Admiralty Division of the High Court by the respective legal
personal representatives of three persons on board the Bushire against
the owners of the Bernina. Those persons were killed by a collision
between the two vessels, both of which were negligently navigated.
One of the three persons (Toeg) was a passenger on the Bushire; one
(Armstrong) was an engineer of the ship, though not to blame for
the collision. The third (Owen) was her second officer, and was in
charge of her, and was himself to blame for the collision. The questions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>for decision are, whether any, and if any, which of these actions
can be maintained? and if any of them can, then whether the claims
recoverable are to be awarded according to the principles which prevail
at common law, or according to those which are adopted in the Court
of Admiralty in cases of collision.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The learned judge then decides that although actions under Lord
Campbell’s Act for causing death can now be brought in the Admiralty
Division, yet the assessment of damages is to be governed by the
rules prevailing in common-law actions.]</p>

<p class='c007'>Having cleared the ground thus far, it is necessary to return to the
statute and see under what circumstances an action upon it can be
supported. The first matter to be considered is whether there has been
any such wrongful act, neglect, or default of the defendants as would,
if death had not ensued, have entitled the three deceased persons respectively
to have sued the defendants. Now, as regards one of them,
namely, Owen, the second officer, who was himself to blame for the
collision, it is clear that, if death had not ensued, he could not have
maintained an action against the defendants. There was negligence on
his part contributing to the collision, and no evidence to show that,
notwithstanding his negligence, the defendants could, by taking reasonable
care, have avoided the collision. There was what is called
such contributory negligence on his part as to render an action by him
unsustainable. It follows, therefore, that his representatives can recover
nothing under Lord Campbell’s Act for his widow and children,
and their action cannot be maintained. The other two actions are not
so easily disposed of. They raise two questions: (1) Whether the passenger
Toeg, if alive, could have successfully sued the defendants; and
if he could, then (2) whether there is any difference between the case
of the passenger and that of the engineer Armstrong. The learned
judge whose decision is under review felt himself bound by authority
to decide both actions against the plaintiffs. The authorities which the
learned judge followed are Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, 8 C. B. 115, and
Armstrong <em>v.</em> Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Ry. Co., Law Rep. 10 Ex. 47;
and the real question to be determined is whether they can be properly
overruled or not. Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, was decided in 1849,
and has been generally followed at Nisi Prius ever since when cases
like it have arisen. But it is curious to see how reluctant the Courts
have been to affirm its principle after argument, and how they have
avoided doing so, preferring, where possible, to decide cases before
them on other grounds. See, for example, Rigby <em>v.</em> Hewitt, 5 Ex.
240; Greenland <em>v.</em> Chaplin, 5 Ex. 243; Waite <em>v.</em> North Eastern Ry.
Co., E. B. &amp; E. 719. I am not aware that the principle on which
Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, was decided has ever been approved by
any Court which has had to consider it. On the other hand, that case
has been criticised and said to be contrary to principle by persons of
the highest eminence, not only in this country, but also in Scotland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>and in America. And while it is true that Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,
has never been overruled, it is also true that it has never been affirmed
by any Court which could properly overrule it, and it cannot be yet
said to have become indisputably settled law. I do not think, therefore,
that it is too late for a Court of Appeal to reconsider it, or to
overrule it if clearly contrary to well settled legal principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, was an action founded on Lord Campbell’s
Act. The facts were shortly as follows. The deceased was a
passenger in an omnibus, and he had just got off out of it. He was
knocked down and killed by another omnibus belonging to the defendants.
There was negligence on the part of the drivers of both omnibuses,
and it appears that there was also negligence on the part of the
deceased himself. The jury found a verdict for the defendants, and
there does not seem to have been any reason why the Court should
have disallowed the verdict if not driven to do so on technical grounds.
In those days, however, a misdirection by the judge to the jury compelled
the Court to grant a new trial, whether any injustice had been
done or not; and accordingly the plaintiff moved for a new trial on
the ground of misdirection, and it is with reference to this point that
the decision of the Court is of importance. The learned judge who
tried the case told the jury in effect to find for the defendant if they
thought that the deceased was killed either by reason of his own want
of care or by reason of want of care on the part of the driver of the
omnibus out of which he was getting. The last direction was complained
of, but was upheld by the Court. The <em>ratio decidendi</em> was
that if the death of the deceased was not occasioned by his own negligence
it was occasioned by the joint negligence of both drivers, and
that, if so, the negligence of the driver of the omnibus off which the
deceased was getting was the negligence of the deceased; and the
reason for so holding was that the deceased had voluntarily placed
himself under the care of the driver. Maule, J., puts it thus: “The
deceased must be considered as identified with the driver of the omnibus
in which he voluntarily became a passenger, and the negligence of
the driver was the negligence of the deceased.” This theory of identification
was quite new. No trace of it is to be found in any earlier
decision, nor in any legal treatise, English or foreign, so far as I have
been able to ascertain, nor has it ever been satisfactorily explained.
It must be assumed, for the purpose of considering the grounds of
the decision in question, that the passenger was not himself in fault.
Assuming this to be so, then, if both drivers were negligent, and both
caused the injury to the passenger, it is difficult to understand why
both drivers or their masters should not be liable to him. The doctrine
of identification laid down in Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, is, to
me, quite unintelligible. It is, in truth, a fictitious extension of the
principles of agency, but to say that the driver of a public conveyance
is the agent of the passengers is to say that which is not true in fact.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Such a doctrine, if made the basis of further reasoning, leads to results
which are wholly untenable, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</span></i>, to the result that the passengers
would be liable for the negligence of the person driving them,
which is obviously absurd, but which, of course, the Court never
meant. All the Court meant to say was that for purposes of suing
for negligence the passenger was in no better position than the man
driving him. But why not? The driver of a public vehicle is not
selected by the passenger otherwise than by being hailed by him as one
of the public to take him up; and such selection, if selection it can be
called, does not create the relation of principal and agent or master
and servant between the passenger and the driver, the passenger
knows nothing of the driver and has no control over him; nor is the
driver in any proper sense employed by the passenger. The driver, if
not his own master, is hired, paid, or employed by the owner of the
vehicle he drives or by some other person who lets the vehicle to him.
The orders he obeys are his employer’s orders. These orders, in the
case of an omnibus, are to drive from such a place to such a place and
take up and put down passengers; and in the case of a cab the orders
are to drive where the passenger for the time being may desire to go,
within the limits expressly or impliedly set by the employer. If the
passenger actively interferes with the driver by giving him orders as
to what he is to do, I can understand the meaning of the expression
that the passenger identifies himself with the driver, but no such interference
was suggested in Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>. The principles
of the law of negligence, and in particular of what is called contributory
negligence, have been discussed on many occasions since that case
was decided, and are much better understood now than they were
thirty years ago. Tuff <em>v.</em> Warman, 5 C. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 573, in the Exchequer
Chamber, and Radley <em>v.</em> London &amp; North Western Ry. Co., 1 App.
Cas. 754, in the House of Lords, show the true grounds on which a
person himself guilty of negligence is unable to maintain an action
against another for an injury occasioned by the combined negligence
of both. If the proximate cause of the injury is the negligence of the
plaintiff as well as that of the defendant, the plaintiff cannot recover
anything. The reason for this is not easily discoverable. But I take
it to be settled that an action at common law by A. against B. for
injury directly caused to A. by the want of care of A. and B. will not
lie. As Pollock, C. B., pointed out in Greenland <em>v.</em> Chaplin, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,
the jury cannot take the consequences and divide them in proportion
according to the negligence of the one or the other party. But if the
plaintiff can show that although he has himself been negligent, the
real and proximate cause of the injury sustained by him was the negligence
of the defendant, the plaintiff can maintain an action, as is
shown not only by Tuff <em>v.</em> Warman, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, and Radley <em>v.</em> London &amp;
North Western Ry. Co., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, but also by the well-known case of
Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, 10 M. &amp; W. 546, and other cases of that class. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>cases which give rise to actions for negligence are primarily reducible
to three classes, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. A. without fault of his own is injured by the negligence of B.,
then B. is liable to A. 2. A. by his own fault is injured by B. without
fault on his part, then B. is not liable to A. 3. A. is injured by B.
by the fault more or less of both combined; then the following further
distinctions have to be made: (<em>a</em>) if, notwithstanding B.’s negligence,
A. with reasonable care could have avoided the injury, he cannot sue
B.: Butterfield <em>v.</em> Forrester, 11 East, 60; Bridge <em>v.</em> Grand Junction
Ry. Co., 3 M. &amp; W. 244; Dowell <em>v.</em> General Steam Navigation Co.,
5 E. &amp; B. 195; (<em>b</em>) if, notwithstanding A.’s negligence, B. with reasonable
care could have avoided injuring A., A. can sue B.: Tuff <em>v.</em>
Warman, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>; Radley <em>v.</em> London &amp; North Western Ry. Co., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>;
Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>; (<em>c</em>) if there has been as much want of reasonable
care on A.’s part as on B.’s or, in other words, if the proximate
cause of the injury is the want of reasonable care on both sides, A.
cannot sue B. In such a case A. cannot with truth say that he has
been injured by B.’s negligence, he can only with truth say that he has
been injured by his own carelessness and B.’s negligence, and the two
combined give no cause of action at common law. This follows from
the two sets of decisions already referred to. But why in such a case
the damages should not be apportioned, I do not profess to understand.
However, as already stated, the law on this point is settled,
and not open to judicial discussion. If now another person is introduced
the same principles will be found applicable. Substitute in the
foregoing cases B. and C. for B., and unless C. is A.’s agent or servant
there will be no difference in the result, except that A. will have two
persons instead of one liable to him. A. may sue B. and C. in one
action, and recover damages against them both; or he may sue them
separately and recover the whole damage sustained against the one he
sues: Clark <em>v.</em> Chambers, 3 Q. B. D. 327, where all the previous authorities
were carefully examined by the late L. C. J. Cockburn. This
is no doubt hard on the defendant, who is alone sued, and this hardship
seems to have influenced the Court in deciding Thorogood <em>v.</em>
Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>. In that case the Court appears to have thought it hard
on the defendant to make him pay all the damages due to the plaintiff,
and that it was no hardship to the plaintiff to exonerate the defendant
from liability, as the plaintiff had a clear remedy against the master of
the omnibus in which he was a passenger. But it is difficult to see the
justice of exonerating the defendant from all liability in respect of his
own wrong and of throwing the whole liability on some one who was no
more to blame than he. The injustice to the defendant, which the
Court sought to avoid, is common to all cases in which a wrong is done
by two people and one of them alone is made to pay for it. The rule
which does not allow of contribution among wrong-doers is what produces
hardship in these cases, but the hardship produced by that rule (if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>really applicable to such cases as these under discussion) does not justify
the Court in exonerating one of the wrong-doers from all responsibility
for his own misconduct or the misconduct of his servants. I can
hardly believe that if the plaintiff in Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, had
sued the proprietors of both omnibuses it would have been held that
he had no right of action against one of them. Having given my reasons
for my inability to concur in the doctrine laid down in Thorogood
<em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, I proceed to consider how far that doctrine is supported
by other authorities. [After commenting on various authorities];
Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, and Armstrong <em>v.</em> Lancashire &amp;
Yorkshire Ry. Co., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, affirm that, although if A. is injured by the
combined negligence of B. and C., A. can sue B. and C., or either of
them, he cannot sue C. if he, A., is under the care of B. or in his employ.
From this general doctrine I am compelled most respectfully to
dissent, but if B. is A.’s agent or servant the doctrine is good. In
Scotland the decision in Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, was discussed
and held to be unsatisfactory in the case of Adams <em>v.</em> Glasgow &amp;
South Western Ry. Co., 3 Court Sess. Cas. 215. In America the subject
was recently examined with great care by the Supreme Court of
the United States in Little <em>v.</em> Hackett, 14 Am. Law Record, 577, 54
Am. Rep. 15,<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c015'><sup>[228]</sup></a> in which the English and American cases were reviewed,
and the doctrine laid down in Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, was distinctly
repudiated as contrary to sound principles. In this case the
plaintiff was driving in a hackney carriage and was injured by a collision
between it and a railway train on a level crossing. There was
negligence on the part of the driver of the carriage and on the part
of the railway company’s servants, but it was held that the plaintiff
was not precluded from maintaining an action against the railway
company. In this country Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, was distinctly
disapproved by Dr. Lushington in The Milan, Lush. 388; and even
Lord Bramwell, who has gone further than any other judge in upholding
the decision, has expressed disapproval of the grounds on
which it was based. No text-writer has approved of it, and the comments
in Smith’s Leading Cases are adverse to it (vol. i. p. 266, 6th
ed.). For the reasons above stated, I am of opinion that the doctrines
laid down in Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, and Armstrong <em>v.</em>
Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Ry. Co., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, are contrary to sound legal
principles, and ought not to be regarded as law. Consequently, I
am of opinion that the decision in Toeg’s and Armstrong’s case ought
to be reversed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Concurring opinions were delivered by <span class='sc'>Lord Esher, M. R.</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Lopes, L. J.</span>, the former elaborately reviewing the authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Extract from opinion of <span class='sc'>Lopes, L. J.</span>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>If, again, the passenger is to be considered in the same position as
the driver or owner, and their negligence is to be imputed to him, he
would be liable to third parties; for instance, in case of a collision between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>two omnibuses, where the driver of one was entirely in fault,
every passenger in the omnibus free from blame would have an action
against every passenger in the other omnibus, because every such passenger
would be identified with the driver, and is responsible for his
negligence. Nor, again, in the case just put, could any passenger in
the other omnibus bring an action against the owner of the omnibus in
which he was carried, because the negligence of the driver is to be
imputed to the passenger. If the negligence of the driver is to be attributed
to the passenger for one purpose, it would be impossible to
say he is not to be affected by it for others. Other cases might be put.</p>

<p class='c007'>The more the decision in Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, is examined,
the more anomalous and indefensible that decision appears.</p>

<p class='c007'>The theory of the identification of the passengers with the negligent
driver or owner is, in my opinion, a fallacy and a fiction, contrary to
sound law and opposed to every principle of justice. A passenger in
an omnibus whose injury is caused by the joint negligence of that
omnibus and another, may, in my opinion, maintain an action, either
against the owner of the omnibus in which he was carried or the other
omnibus, or both. I am clearly of opinion Thorogood <em>v.</em> Bryan, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,
should be overruled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Extract from opinion of <span class='sc'>Lord Esher, M. R.</span>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>In Armstrong’s action a point is suggested that he ought not to
recover against the defendants, the owners of the Bernina, because he
could not recover against the owners of the Bushire. He would, it is
rightly said, in an action against the latter, be met by the doctrine of
the accident being occasioned by the negligence of a fellow-servant.
The suggestion would go too far. It would apply where passengers or
goods are carried by railway, or in ship, under a notice limiting the
liability of that railway company or shipowner. It would work manifest
injustice by enabling a person to take advantage of a contract to
which he was a stranger, and for the advantage of which he had given
no consideration. The rule of law is, that a person injured by more
than one wrong-doer may maintain an action for the whole damage
done to him against any of them. There is no condition that he cannot
do so unless he might, if he pleased, maintain an action against
each of them. There is no disadvantage to the one sued, because there
is no contribution between joint wrong-doers. The plaintiff Armstrong
is therefore entitled to judgment for the whole of the damages
he may be able to prove, according to the rule of damages laid down
in Lord Campbell’s Act. So in the case of the plaintiff Toeg. In the
case of Owen, the deceased was personally negligent, so as that his
negligence was partly directly a cause of the injury. He could not
have recovered, neither can his administratrix.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Tort for personal injuries caused by the collision of an electric
car of defendant with a carriage in which the plaintiff was being
driven.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial the evidence for plaintiff tended to show that plaintiff
was being driven in a carriage by her friend B; that B owned the
horse and carriage and was giving her a ride to her home; that plaintiff
in no way interfered with B’s driving, in no manner controlled
him or directed how he should drive, but left the driving to him; and
that the defendant’s car from behind, without any warning, ran into
the hind wheels of the carriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant’s evidence tended to show that the collision was due to
B’s negligently turning suddenly across the track.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge instructed the jury (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>) that if B was careless in
driving and if his carelessness contributed to the injury, then plaintiff
was bound by his carelessness and could not recover. To this instruction
plaintiff excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Verdict for defendant.<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c015'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Rugg, J.</span> This case fairly raises the question as to whether the
negligence of the driver of a vehicle is to be imputed to a guest, riding
with him gratuitously, and personally in the exercise of all the care
which ordinary caution requires.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The learned judge then elaborately reviewed the authorities; and,
both upon authority and principle, sustained the view reached in The
Bernina, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>. He then continued:]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>The rule fairly deducible from our own cases, and supported by the
great weight of authority by courts of other jurisdictions, is that where
an adult person, possessing all his faculties and personally in the exercise
of that degree of care, which common prudence requires under
all the attending circumstances, is injured through the negligence of
some third person and the concurring negligence of one with whom
the plaintiff is riding as guest or companion, between whom and the
plaintiff the relation of master and servant or principal and agent, or
mutual responsibility in a common enterprise, does not in fact exist,
the plaintiff being at the time in no position to exercise authority or
control over the driver, then the negligence of the driver is not imputable
to the injured person, but the latter is entitled to recover
against the one through whose wrong his injuries were sustained.
Disregarding the passenger’s own due care, the test whether the negligence
of the driver is to be imputed to the one riding depends upon
the latter’s control or right of control of the actions of the driver, so
as to constitute in fact the relation of principal and agent or master
and servant, or his voluntary, unconstrained, non-contractual surrender
of all care for himself to the caution of the driver.<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c015'><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Applying this statement of the law to the present case, the result is
that the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover if in the exercise of
common prudence she ought to have given some warning to the driver
of carelessness on his part, which she observed or might have observed
in exercising due care for her own safety,<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c015'><sup>[232]</sup></a> nor if she negligently abandoned
the exercise of her own faculties and trusted entirely to the vigilance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>and care of the driver.<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c015'><sup>[233]</sup></a> She cannot hide behind the fact that
another is driving the vehicle in which she is riding, and thus relieve
herself of her own negligence. What degree of care she should have
exercised, in accepting the invitation to ride, or in observing and calling
to the attention of the driver perils unnoticed by him, depends
upon the circumstances at the time of the injury. On the other hand,
she would be permitted to recover if, in entering and continuing in
the conveyance, she acted with reasonable caution, and had no ground
to suspect incompetency and no cause to anticipate negligence on the
part of the driver, and if the impending danger, although in part produced
by the driver, was so sudden or of such a character as not to
permit or require her to do any act for her own protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>In view of the facts of the case the requests for rulings presented
by the plaintiff were not correct propositions of law and were properly
refused, but the portion of the charge excepted to failed to express
with accuracy and fulness the rights of the plaintiff and the liability
of the defendant to her. The jury were instructed to treat the plaintiff
as identified with the driver, and burdened with his negligence.
For the reasons we have stated and under the circumstances disclosed,
this was not an accurate statement of the law.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Action in the District Court for Ramsey County to recover $2040
for personal injuries caused by a defective street in defendant city.
The case was tried before Brill, J., and a jury, which rendered a general
verdict in favor of plaintiff for $300. The jury also returned a
special verdict, in answer to the specific question submitted by the
court, that the driver of the vehicle from which plaintiff was thrown
was guilty of negligence which contributed to the injury. From a
judgment entered pursuant to the general verdict, defendant appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span><span class='sc'>Start, C. J.</span> The plaintiff was one of a party of twenty-six young
people who celebrated the Fourth of July last by a picnic at Lake
Johanna, about twelve miles from St. Paul. The picnic was a mutual
affair, in that the party consisted of about an equal number of young
men and young women, each lady being invited and escorted by a
gentleman, for whom and herself she furnished lunch; but at meal
time the several lunches were merged, and became a common spread.
The ladies had nothing to do with the matter of the transportation
of the party to and from the lake. This was the exclusive business
of the gentlemen, with which the ladies had no more to do than the
young men had with the lunches. The gentlemen selected one of their
number (Mr. Gibbons) to manage the transportation of the party.
He hired for this purpose a long covered omnibus, drawn by four
horses, and a driver and assistant, to drive the party to the lake and
return. The party were driven to and from the lake in this conveyance,
with the hiring of which, or the payment therefor, or the control
thereof, the ladies, including the plaintiff, had nothing to do, other
than may be inferred, if at all, from the fact that they were members
of the picnic party. On the return trip, when the conveyance had
reached Dale Street, in the city of St. Paul, it was tipped over, by
reason of an embankment therein, whereby the plaintiff was injured.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time of the accident all of the party were riding inside of
the omnibus, except Mr. Gibbons, who was outside, on the driver’s
seat, with the driver and his assistant, and was then driving the
horses; but this fact was unknown to the plaintiff or any of the party
inside of the conveyance. The negligence of the city in the care of
the street was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury, but the
negligence of Mr. Gibbons in driving the horses contributed thereto.
The plaintiff was personally free from any negligence in the premises.
This action was brought by the plaintiff to recover damages on account
of such injuries, and the jury returned a verdict for $300, and a
special verdict that Mr. Gibbons was guilty of contributory negligence
in driving the conveyance. Thereupon the defendant moved for judgment
in its favor upon the special verdict, notwithstanding the general
verdict for the plaintiff. The motion was denied, and judgment
entered for the plaintiff, from which the defendant appealed to this
court.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only question for our decision is whether the negligence of
Mr. Gibbons must be imputed to the plaintiff, and a recovery denied
her for that reason. The rule as to imputed negligence, as settled by
this court in cases other than those where the parties stand in the relation
of parent and child or guardian and ward, is that negligence in
the conduct of another will not be imputed to a party if he neither
authorized such conduct, nor participated therein, nor had the right
or power to control it. If, however, two or more persons unite in the
joint prosecution of a common purpose under such circumstances that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>each has authority, expressed or implied, to act for all in respect to
the control of the means or agencies employed to execute such common
purpose, the negligence of one in the management thereof will be
imputed to all the others. Follman <em>v.</em> City of Mankato, 35 Minn. 522,
29 N. W. 317; Flaherty <em>v.</em> Minneapolis &amp; St. L. Ry. Co., 39 Minn. 328,

N. W. 728.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is too obvious to justify discussion that the plaintiff in this case
neither expressly nor impliedly had any control over the drivers of
the omnibus, or either of them, or of Mr. Gibbons, and that he and she
were not engaged in a joint enterprise in any such sense as made her
so far responsible for his negligence in driving the horses that it must
be imputed to her. The claim of the defendant to the contrary is
unsupported by the facts as disclosed by the record.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>FECHLEY <em>v.</em> SPRINGFIELD TRACTION COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>St. Louis Court of Appeals, Missouri, May 8, 1906.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 119 Missouri Appeal Reports, 358.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Error to Circuit Court, Greene County. Verdict and judgment
for defendant. Plaintiff appeals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Appellant, Fechley, was damaged by the collision of a street car
with a one-horse buggy in which he was riding. The buggy was owned
and driven by Pierce, at whose invitation Fechley was riding. Pierce,
upon his own statement, was negligent in not seasonably looking, or
taking proper precautions, to ascertain if a car was approaching before
he attempted to drive across two parallel railway tracks. The facts
as to the alleged negligence of Fechley are sufficiently stated in the
extracts from the opinion, given below.</p>

<p class='c007'>One error assigned was the submission to the jury of the issue of
appellant’s contributory negligence.<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c015'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span><span class='sc'>Goode, J.</span> [After stating the case; and holding that the negligence
of Pierce would not bar Fechley from recovering against the
company if the motorman’s negligence was in part the proximate
cause of the collision.]</p>

<p class='c007'>Appellant himself must have been free from negligence proximately
contributing to his injury or he is entitled to no damages, granting
that Pierce’s fault does not preclude a recovery and that the motorman’s
fault was a factor in bringing about the casualty. Few, if any,
courts have held that an occupant of a vehicle may entrust his safety
absolutely to the driver of a vehicle, regardless of the imminence
of danger or the visible lack of ordinary caution on the part of the
driver to avoid harm. The law in this state, and in most jurisdictions,
is that if a passenger who is aware of the danger and that the
driver is remiss in guarding against it, takes no care himself to avoid
injury, he cannot recover for one he receives. This is the law not
because the driver’s negligence is imputable to the passenger, but
because the latter’s own negligence proximately contributed to his
damage. Marsh <em>v.</em> Railroad, 104 Mo. App. 577, 78 S. W. 284; Dean
<em>v.</em> Railroad, 129 Pa. St. 514; Township of Crescent <em>v.</em> Anderson, 114

Negligence, sec. 1620; Beach, Con. Neg., sec. 115; 3 Elliott, Railroads,
sec. 1174.</p>

<p class='c007'>[After discussing the pleadings.]</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore the question occurs whether, on the testimony for appellant,
the court would have been justified in holding him guilty of contributory
negligence; and we hold that such a ruling would have been
proper. Appellant swore he knew cars were operated east and west
on Commercial Street, but did not know there were double tracks on
it. The two tracks were right before his eyes as he drove down Commercial
Street and as Pierce turned the horse to cross them. He said
he could have looked out of the buggy by merely pushing the curtain
back with his hand. He was not bound to do this if Pierce’s conduct
was of such a character as to induce a reasonably prudent man to think
there was no danger in driving across the tracks. But Fechley did
not have the right to rely on the precaution taken by Pierce, unless,
under the circumstances, a man of ordinary prudence would have relied
on it. As we have pointed out, the testimony shows Pierce took
no precaution which could be effective. He did not stop at all; nor
did he look for a car until the horse was stepping over the south rail
of the north track. The two tracks were less than five feet apart and
the buggy moved but a few feet after Pierce looked, before the car
struck it near the front of the rear wheels. Meanwhile Fechley was
leaning back in the buggy, though he must have seen they had crossed
the south track and were advancing diagonally on the north one, and,
if he was paying any attention to the situation, must have known that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>a car was likely to come along on that track from the east. Pierce’s
behavior was so grossly careless, that Fechley was imprudent in doing
nothing personally to insure his safety. The essential fact is that
Pierce did not look in time, as Fechley knew, or, in reason, ought to
have known. Therefore Fechley should have stopped Pierce or told
him to look for a car, or have looked himself, before they had advanced
so far into danger. It is palpable from appellant’s own testimony
that he was giving no heed to his safety, but either was relying
blindly on Pierce, or, for some reason, was not aware of the proximity
of the tracks.</p>

<p class='c007'>[After stating authorities.]</p>

<p class='c007'>On the testimony for appellant the case strikes us as one of concurrent
negligence; for the buggy had not gone more than from six to
twelve feet after Pierce looked for a car, until the collision occurred.
There is an inconsistency in appellant’s theory. He would have it
that there was an appearance of danger of a collision which should
have warned the motorman, as soon as the buggy was turned to go
over the tracks and before Pierce looked for a car, but that appellant
himself was not negligent in failing to guard against this apparent
danger. That argument for appellant emphasizes and makes clear his
own carelessness. The counsel in the case give several close calculations
in support of their respective theories, and appellant’s attorneys
endeavor to demonstrate that the motorman could have stopped the
car before it reached the buggy, if he had begun to get control of it
when the horse turned to go over the south track. They insist that
appellant, though he may have been guilty of contributory negligence,
was entitled to a finding by the jury, under proper instructions, on the
issue of whether or not the motorman could have prevented the accident
after the turn, it being assumed that the danger of a collision
then became apparent. The court submitted that issue by a charge
which was extremely favorable to appellant.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>NEWMAN <em>v.</em> PHILLIPSBURG HORSE CAR COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New Jersey, July Term, 1890.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 52 New Jersey Law Reports, 446.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>The plaintiff was a child two years of age; she was in the custody
of her sister, who was twenty-two; the former, being left by herself
for a few minutes, got upon the railroad track of the defendant, and
was hurt by the car. The occurrence took place in a public street of
the village of Phillipsburg. The carelessness of the defendant was
manifest, as at the time of the accident there was no one in charge of
the horse drawing the car, the driver being in the car collecting fares.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>The Circuit judge submitted the three following propositions to
this Court for its advisory opinion, viz.:—</p>

<p class='c007'><em>First.</em> Whether the negligence of the persons in charge of the
plaintiff, an infant minor, should be imputed to the said plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Second.</em> Whether the conduct of the persons in charge of the plaintiff
at the time of the injury complained of, was not so demonstrably
negligent that the said Circuit Court should have nonsuited the plaintiff,
or that the Court should have directed the jury to find for the
defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Third.</em> Whether a new trial ought not to be granted, on the ground
that the damages awarded are excessive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Argued at February term, 1890, before <span class='sc'>Beasley, C. J.</span>, and <span class='sc'>Scudder</span>,
<span class='sc'>Dixon</span> and <span class='sc'>Reed</span>, JJ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opinion of the court was delivered by—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Beasley, C. J.</span> There is but a single question presented by this case,
and that question plainly stands among the vexed questions of the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The problem is, whether an infant of tender years can be vicariously
negligent, so as to deprive itself of a remedy that it would
otherwise be entitled to. In some of the American states this question
has been answered by the Courts in the affirmative, and in others in
the negative. To the former of these classes belongs the decision in
Hartfield <em>v.</em> Roper &amp; Newell, reported in 21 Wend. 615. This case
appears to have been one of first impression on this subject, and it is
to be regarded, not only as the precursor, but as the parent of all the
cases of the same strain that have since appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inquiry with respect to the effect of the negligence of the custodian
of the infant, too young to be intelligent of situations and circumstances,
was directly presented for decision in the primary case
thus referred to, for the facts were these: The plaintiff, a child of
about two years of age, was standing or sitting in the snow in a public
road, and in that situation was run over by a sleigh driven by the
defendants. The opinion of the Court was, that as the child was permitted
by its custodian to wander into a position of such danger it was
without remedy for the hurts thus received, unless they were voluntarily
inflicted, or were the product of gross carelessness on the part of
the defendants. It is obvious that the judicial theory was, that the
infant was, through the medium of its custodian, the doer, in part, of
its own misfortune, and that, consequently, by force of the well-known
rule, under such conditions, he had no right to an action. This, of
course, was visiting the child for the neglect of the custodian, and
such infliction is justified in the case cited in this wise: “The infant,”
says the Court, “is not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</span></i>. He belongs to another, to
whom discretion in the care of his person is exclusively confided.
That person is keeper and agent for this purpose; in respect to third
persons his act must be deemed that of the infant; his neglects the
infant’s neglects.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>It will be observed that the entire content of this quotation is the
statement of a single fact, and a deduction from it; the premise being,
that the child must be in the care and charge of an adult, and the inference
being that, for that reason, the neglects of the adult are the
neglects of the infant. But surely this is, conspicuously, a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non sequitur</span></i>.
How does the custody of the infant justify, or lead to, the imputation
of another’s fault to him? The law, natural and civil, puts
the infant under the care of the adult, but how can this right to care
for and protect be construed into a right to waive, or forfeit, any of the
legal rights of the infant? The capacity to make such waiver or forfeiture
is not a necessary, or even convenient, incident of this office of
the adult, but, on the contrary, is quite inconsistent with it, for the
power to protect is the opposite of the power to harm, either by act
or omission. In this case in Wendell it is evident that the rule of law
enunciated by it is founded in the theory that the custodian of the infant
is the agent of the infant; but this is a mere assumption without
legal basis, for such custodian is the agent, not of the infant, but of
the law. If such supposed agency existed, it would embrace many interests
of the infant, and could not be confined to the single instance
where an injury is inflicted by the coöperative tort of the guardian.
And yet it seems certain that such custodian cannot surrender or impair
a single right of any kind that is vested in the child, nor impose
any legal burthen upon it. If a mother travelling with her child in
her arms should agree with a railway company, that in case of an
accident to such infant by reason of the joint negligence of herself
and the company the latter should not be liable to a suit by the child,
such an engagement would be plainly invalid on two grounds: <em>first</em>,
the contract would be <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">contra bonos mores</span></i>, and <em>second</em>, because the
mother was not the agent of the child authorized to enter into the
agreement. Nevertheless, the position has been deemed defensible
that the same evil consequences to the infant will follow from the
negligence of the mother, in the absence of such supposed contract, as
would have resulted if such contract should have been made and
should have been held valid.</p>

<p class='c007'>In fact, this doctrine of the imputability of the misfeasance of the
keeper of a child to the child itself, is deemed to be a pure interpolation
into the law, for until the case under criticism it was absolutely
unknown; nor is it sustained by legal analogies. Infants have always
been the particular objects of the favor and protection of the law. In
the language of an ancient authority this doctrine is thus expressed:
“The common principle is, that an infant in all things which sound
in his benefit shall have favor and preferment in law as well as another
man, but shall not be prejudiced by anything in his disadvantage.”
9 Vin. Abr. 374. And it would appear to be plain that nothing could
be more to the prejudice of an infant than to convert, by construction
of law, the connection between himself and his custodian into an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>agency to which the harsh rule of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">respondeat superior</span></i> should be applicable.
The answerableness of the principal for the authorized acts
of his agent is not so much the dictate of natural justice as of public
policy, and has arisen, with some propriety, from the circumstances,
that the creation of the agency is a voluntary act, and that it can be
controlled and ended at the will of its creator. But in the relationship
between the infant and its keeper, all these decisive characteristics
are wholly wanting. The law imposes the keeper upon the child
who, of course, can neither control or remove him, and the injustice,
therefore, of making the latter responsible, in any measure whatever,
for the torts of the former, would seem to be quite evident. Such
subjectivity would be hostile, in every respect, to the natural rights of
the infant, and, consequently, cannot, with any show of reason, be
introduced into that provision which both necessity and law establish
for his protection. Nor can it be said that its existence is necessary
to give just enforcement to the rights of others. When it happens
that both the infant and its custodian have been injured by the coöperative
negligence of such custodian and a third party, it seems
reasonable, at least in some degree, that the latter should be enabled
to say to the custodian, “You and I, by our common carelessness,
have done this wrong, and, therefore, neither can look to the other
for redress;” but when such wrong-doer says to the infant, “Your
guardian and I, by our joint misconduct, have brought this loss upon
you, consequently you have no right of action against me, but you
must look for indemnification to your guardian alone,” a proposition
is stated that appears to be without any basis either in good sense
or law. The conversion of the infant, who is entirely free from fault,
into a wrong-doer, by imputation, is a logical contrivance uncongenial
with the spirit of jurisprudence. The sensible and legal doctrine is
this: An infant of tender years cannot be charged with negligence;
nor can he be so charged with the commission of such fault by substitution,
for he is incapable of appointing an agent, the consequence
being, that he can, in no case, be considered to be the blamable cause,
either in whole or in part, of his own injury. There is no injustice,
nor hardship, in requiring all wrong-doers to be answerable to a person
who is incapable either of self-protection or of being a participator
in their misfeasance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor is it to be overlooked that the theory here repudiated, if it
should be adopted, would go the length of making an infant in its
nurse’s arms answerable for all the negligences of such nurse while
thus employed in its service. Every person so damaged by the careless
custodian would be entitled to his action against the infant. If
the neglects of the guardian are to be regarded as the neglects of the
infant, as was asserted in the New York decision, it would, from logical
necessity, follow, that the infant must indemnify those who should
be harmed by such neglects. That such a doctrine has never prevailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>is conclusively shown by the fact that in the reports there is no
indication that such a suit has ever been brought.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has already been observed that judicial opinion, touching the
subject just discussed, is in a state of direct antagonism, and it would,
therefore, serve no useful purpose to refer to any of them. It is sufficient
to say, that the leading text-writers have concluded that the
weight of such authority is adverse to the doctrine that an infant can
become, in any wise, a tortfeasor by imputation. 1 Shearm. &amp; R. Neg.,
§ 75; Whart. Neg. § 311; 2 Wood Railw. L., p. 1284.</p>

<p class='c007'>In our opinion, the weight of reason is in the same scale.</p>

<p class='c007'>It remains to add that we do not think the damages so excessive as
to place the verdict under judicial control.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>BISAILLON <em>v.</em> BLOOD<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New Hampshire, June, 1888.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 64 New Hampshire Reports, 565.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Case, for the negligent injury of the plaintiff. Verdict for the
defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>In October, 1886, the defendant, while driving a horse in a carriage
on a public street of Manchester, ran over and injured the plaintiff,
an infant then five years old, who had wandered from his home without
an attendant or custodian, and was playing in the street with
other children of about the same age.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury were instructed that the plaintiff being too young to exercise
care for himself, it was the duty of his parents or natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>guardians to exercise care and prudence for him to prevent his being
injured, and if they were negligent in this respect, and their neglect
contributed to produce the injury complained of, he cannot recover.
To these instructions the plaintiff excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Carpenter, J.</span> The plaintiff would be entitled to damages for the
defendant’s negligent injury of his property similarly exposed to danger
by the carelessness of his guardian. Davies <em>v.</em> Mann, 10 M. &amp; W.
546; Smith <em>v.</em> Railroad, 35 N. H. 366, 367; Giles <em>v.</em> Railroad, 55
N. H. 555. An infant of such tender years as to be incapable of exercising
care is not less under the protection of the law than his chattel.
The previous negligence of the plaintiff’s parents was immaterial.
The only question for the jury was, whether the defendant by the exercise
of ordinary care could have prevented the injury; if she could
not, she was without fault, and is not liable; if she could, she is liable
whether the plaintiff was in the street by reason of, or without, his
parents’ negligence. In cases of this character, where an irresponsible
child or an idiot is, by the negligence of the parent or guardian, exposed
to peril without an attendant, or where a chattel is in like manner
placed by the owner in a dangerous position, and either is injured
by the act of a “voluntary agent present and acting at the time”
(State <em>v.</em> Railroad, 52 N. H. 528, 557), the question of contributory
negligence is not involved. The only question is, whether the defendant
by ordinary care could or could not have prevented the injury.

<h5 class='c013'>CONSOLIDATED TRACTION COMPANY <em>v.</em> HONE<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New Jersey, November Term, 1896.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 59 New Jersey Law Reports, 275.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Beasley, C. J.</span> This is a suit brought by Henry Hone as the administrator
of the estate of his deceased son, who was a minor and was
killed by the carelessness of the servants of the plaintiff in error, the
Consolidated Traction Company, in the management of one of their
cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statute lying at the basis of the suit provides “that whenever
the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect or default,
and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death had not
ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and
recover damages in respect thereof, then and in every such case the
person who or the corporation which would have been liable if death
had not ensued, shall be liable to an action of damages notwithstanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>the death of the person injured,” etc. Gen. Stat., p. 1188,
§ 10.<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c015'><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The following section directs “that the action shall be brought by
and in the name of the personal representatives of the deceased person,
and that the amount recovered shall be for the exclusive benefit
of the widow and next of kin of such deceased person; and that in
every such action the jury may give such damages as they shall deem
fair and just, with reference to the pecuniary injury resulting from
such death to the wife and next of kin of such deceased person,” etc.
Id., § 11.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these extracts from the statute it will be at once perceived
that in this suit founded upon it, as in all others of the same class,
but two questions are raised, and but two can be raised upon the
record, viz., first, could the deceased, if he had survived, have maintained
an action? and second, this being so, what pecuniary loss has
fallen on his next of kin by reason of his death?</p>

<p class='c007'>These are the facts constituting the issue to be tried, and no subject
for trial can be more clearly defined.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding this it is contended in this case by the counsel of
this traction company that they have the right to defeat the action if
they can show that the death in question was the result in part of the
negligent conduct of the next of kin, although such negligent conduct
is not to be imputed to the infant who is deceased. The plaintiff in
the present case is not only the personal representative, but is likewise
the next of kin, and it is insisted that as the damages that may
be recovered will enure exclusively to his benefit, he should in justice
not be allowed to recover them if he was in part the cause of their
production.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>But it is to be remembered that the legal doctrine that bars a party
injured by the unintentional misconduct of another by reason of his
having himself been, in a measure, the occasion of the resulting damage,
is rather an artificial rule of the law than a principle of justice,
for its effect generally is to cast the entire loss ensuing from the joint
fault upon one of the culpable parties, and oftentimes upon him who
is but little to blame. Such a legal regulation has no claim to extension,
and to apply it as is now insisted on would be to use it in a novel
way. The question whether the deceased was negligent is within the
issue formed by the pleading; while the question whether a third
person who in his individual capacity has no connection with the suit
was negligent has nothing whatever to do with such issue. In the
legal practice of this state it is the established course to exclude everything
that is not embraced in the issue as the parties have framed it
and as it appears upon the record. On the trial of this case the inquiry
whether the father of the deceased minor had, by his want
of care, been instrumental in the production of the accident, was a
matter utterly irrelevant to the subject then submitted to judicial
inquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statute of Iowa, relating to this subject, and our own are similar,
and in Wymore’s case (78 Iowa, 396)<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c015'><sup>[240]</sup></a> the court of that state expressed
very distinctly what is deemed the correct view of this topic,
in these words: “If,” says the opinion, “his parents, by their negligence,
contributed to his death, that does not seem to be a sufficient
reason for denying his estate relief. Such negligence would prevent a
recovery by the parents in their own right.... It is claimed that,&#160;... since they inherited his estate, the rule which would bar a negligent
parent from recovering in such case in his own right ought to
apply. But the plaintiff seeks to recover in right of the child and not
of the parents. It may be that a recovery in this case will result in
conferring an undeserved benefit upon the father, but that is a matter
which we cannot investigate. If the facts are such that the child
could have recovered had his injuries not been fatal, his administrator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>can recover the full amount of damages which the estate of the child
sustained.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The subject will be found illustrated by a reference to many cases
in 4 Am. &amp; Eng. Encycl. L. 88.</p>

<p class='c007'>My conclusion is that there is no fault to be found with the trial of
this case in reference to this point.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>RICHMOND, FREDERICKSBURG &amp; POTOMAC R. CO. <em>v.</em> MARTIN’S ADM’R<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court of Appeals, Virginia, December 9, 1903.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 102 Virginia Reports, 201.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Whittle, J.</span>... This action was brought by the defendant in
error, Patrick Martin, administrator of Alice Martin, deceased, against
the plaintiff in error, the Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac Railroad
Company, to recover damages for the negligent killing of his
intestate, a daughter seven years of age, by a passenger train of the
defendant company at a public crossing. The mother of the child
was killed in the same collision, and the action was instituted for
the sole benefit of the father, who, under the statute, is entitled to
the recovery. At the trial there was a verdict for the plaintiff, upon
which the judgment under review was rendered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant adduced evidence tending to prove that Patrick
Martin, Jr., a minor eleven years old, and a son of the plaintiff, was
put in charge of a two-horse Dayton wagon, as driver by his father,
in which his mother and two younger sisters and a negro boy were to
be driven from their home in the country to the city of Fredericksburg;
that Patrick Martin, Jr., negligently drove upon and attempted
to cross the railway track at Falmouth crossing, in plain view of a
rapidly approaching train; and that in the collision which followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>his mother and two sisters, who occupied a rear seat in the vehicle,
were instantly killed. Thereupon the defendant moved the court to
instruct the jury that if they believed from the evidence that Patrick
Martin, Jr., the son and servant of the plaintiff, attempted to cross
the track under the circumstances detailed, his conduct constituted
such contributory negligence as to bar a recovery. The court refused
to give the instruction, which ruling presents for decision the sole
question in the case, namely, whether a father, whose negligence has
contributed to the death of his minor child, can, under the statute, in
an action instituted by him as administrator, suing for his own benefit,
recover damages for the death of the child. The statute requires
such actions to be brought by and in the name of the personal representative
of the deceased person, and empowers the jury to award
such damages as to it may seem fair and just, not exceeding ten
thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'>The primary object of the statute in allowing an action to recover
damages for death by wrongful act of another, like its prototype,
Lord Campbell’s act, was to compensate the family of the deceased,
and was not in the interest of the general estate, the provision being
that: “The amount recovered in any such action shall, after the payment
of costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, be paid to the wife,
husband, parent, and child of the deceased, in such proportion as the
jury may have directed, or, if they have not directed, according to the
statute of distributions, and shall be free from all debts and liabilities
of the deceased; but if there be no wife, husband, parent, or child, the
amount so received shall be assets in the hands of the personal representative,
to be disposed of according to law.” Code 1887, secs. 2903,
2905.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be observed that by the express language of the statute the
damages awarded cannot become assets in the hands of the administrator,
to be disposed of according to law, if the decedent is survived
by a wife, husband, parent, or child; and the recovery is also made
free from all debts of the decedent, thus leaving no doubt of the legislative
intent to treat the recovery as wholly independent of the decedent
and his estate in the event of the survival of any one of the
enumerated kin, and making it enure directly and personally to such
next of kin by force of the statute, and not derivatively from the decedent,
to whom it never belonged either in fact or in contemplation
of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The authorities all agree that there can be no recovery where the
action is brought in the name and for the benefit of one whose negligence
has contributed to the accident. Thus, if the child in this instance
had been injured, instead of killed, and the father had brought
a common-law action to recover damages for the injury, contributory
negligence on his part, if established, would have constituted a bar to
the action. But the contributory negligence of the father would interpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>no defence to an action by the child for such injury. The rule
is that the child’s want of responsibility for negligence can no more be
invoked to maintain the action of the negligent father than can the
negligence of the latter be imputed to the child to defeat an action by
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this case both parties, at the time of the accident, were represented
by agents—the defendant company by its employees, and the
plaintiff, by his son, to whose care he had confided the custody of the
younger sister—and both were responsible for the acts and omissions
of their respective agents. Glassey <em>v.</em> Ry. Co., 57 Pa. 172.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Bellefontaine Ry. Co. <em>v.</em> Snyder, 24 Ohio St. 670, the court said:
“Where an infant intrusted to the care and custody of another by the
father, is injured through the negligence of a railroad company, the
custodian of the child also being guilty of negligence which contributed
to the result, although the infant may maintain an action for
such injury, the father cannot; the negligence of his agent, the custodian
of the child, being in law ‘the negligence of the father.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When an action for negligent injury of an infant is brought by
the parent, or for the parent’s own benefit, it is very justly held that
the contributory negligence of such parent may be shown in bar of
the action, the negligence of his agent to whom he had intrusted the
child having contributed to cause the injury; and such negligence,
being, in contemplation of law, the parent’s negligence, was held to
bar the action.” Beach on Con. Neg., sec. 131.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine of imputed negligence has no application to the case,
but the rule that the negligent father cannot recover is founded upon
the fundamental principle that no one can acquire a right of action
by his own negligence. The principle involves a maxim of the law as
old as the common law itself. The difference between an action by
the father for injuries to the child where death does not ensue and an
action by the father as administrator of his dead child, brought under
the statute for his own benefit, is a difference in form merely, not in
substance, and on principle there can be no more reason for permitting
a recovery in the latter case than in the former. In both the
father is the substantial plaintiff and the sole beneficiary. To allow a
recovery in either would be a violation of the policy of the law, which
forbids that one shall reap a benefit from his own misconduct. Accordingly
the authorities are practically unanimous to the effect that
the guiding principle in both classes of cases is identical, and the
contributory negligence of the beneficial plaintiff will as effectually
defeat a recovery in the one case as in the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Kinkead’s Com. on Torts, sec. 474, the author says the rule is
well settled that the negligence of a parent of a minor is a bar to an
action by him to recover damages for an injury to the minor, and
adds: “It may, however, be contended with equal force that the fact
that a parent is a beneficiary in case of death, that contributory negligence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>on his part should be a defence to an action brought under the
statutes now being considered, as well as in an action in his own
name for a personal injury. The policy of the law is not to allow a
recovery for the benefit of a wrong-doer, and this should be applied as
well to actions in the name of another for the benefit of those who
may have contributed to the wrong. What shall constitute a defence
to this class of actions is not prescribed in these statutes, but is governed
by the same principles applicable to personal injuries. It is
considered by the majority of cases that the administrator is only a
trustee or a mere nominal party, and that the action will be defeated
by the contributory negligence of the beneficiaries.” [Remainder of
opinion omitted.]</p>

<h5 class='c013'>WELCH <em>v.</em> WESSON<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, September Term, 1856.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 6 Gray, 505.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Action of tort for running down the plaintiff while driving on the
highway, and breaking his sleigh. Trial in the Court of Common
Pleas, before Mellen, C. J., who signed a bill of exceptions, the substance
of which is stated in the opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Merrick, J.</span> It appears from the bill of exceptions to have been
fully proved upon the trial that the defendant wilfully ran down the
plaintiff and broke his sleigh, as is alleged in the declaration. No
justification or legal excuse of this act was asserted or attempted to
be shown by the defendant; but he was permitted, against the plaintiff’s
objection, to introduce evidence tending to prove that it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>done while the parties were trotting horses in competition with each
other for a purse of money, the ownership of which was to be determined
by the issue of the race. And it was ruled by the presiding
judge, that if this fact was established, no action could be maintained
by the plaintiff to recover compensation for the damages he had sustained,
even though the injury complained of was wilfully inflicted.
Under such instructions, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>We presume it may be assumed as an undisputed principle of law,
that no action will lie to recover a demand, or a supposed claim for
damages, if, to establish it, the plaintiff requires aid from an illegal
transaction, or is under the necessity of showing, and depending in
any degree upon an illegal agreement, to which he himself had been
a party. Gregg <em>v.</em> Wyman, 4 Cush. 322; Woodman <em>v.</em> Hubbard, 5
Foster, 67; Phalen <em>v.</em> Clark, 19 Conn. 421; Simpson <em>v.</em> Bloss, 7
Taunt. 246. But this principle will not sustain the ruling of the
Court, which went far beyond it, and laid down a much broader and
more comprehensive doctrine. Taken without qualification, and just
as they were given to the jury, the instructions import that, if two
persons are engaged in the same unlawful enterprise, each of them,
during the continuance of such engagement, is irresponsible for wilful
injuries done to the property of the other. No such proposition
as this can be true. He who violates the law must suffer its penalties;
but yet in all other respects he is under its protection, and entitled to
the benefit of its remedies.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in this case the plaintiff had no occasion to show, in order to
maintain his action, that he was engaged, at the time his property was
injured, in any unlawful pursuit, or that he had previously made any
illegal contract. It is true that, when he suffered the injury, he was
acting in violation of the law; for all horse trotting upon wagers for
money is expressly declared by statute to be a misdemeanor punishable
by fine and imprisonment. St. 1846, c. 200. But neither the contract
nor the race had, as far as appears from the facts reported in
the bill of exceptions, or from the intimations of the Court in its ruling,
anything to do with the trespass committed upon the property of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>the plaintiff. That he had no occasion to show into what stipulations
the parties had entered, or what were the rules or regulations by which
they were to be governed in the race, or whether they were in fact engaged
in any such business at all, is apparent from the course of the
proceedings at the trial. The plaintiff introduced evidence tending to
prove the wrongful acts complained of in the writ, and the damage
done to his property, and there rested his case. If nothing more had
been shown, he would clearly have been entitled to recover. He had
not attempted to derive assistance either from an illegal contract or an
illegal transaction. It was the defendant, and not the plaintiff, who
had occasion to invoke assistance from proof of the illegal agreement
and conduct in which both parties had equally participated. From
such sources neither of the parties should have been permitted to
derive a benefit. The plaintiff sought nothing of this kind, and the
mutual misconduct of the parties in one particular cannot exempt the
defendant from his obligation to respond for the injurious consequences
of his own illegal misbehavior in another.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was an action on the Rev. Sts., c. 25, § 22, for an injury alleged
to have been received by the plaintiff, by reason of a defect in a highway,
in the town of Swansey, which said town was by law obliged to
repair.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial in the Court of Common Pleas, before Wells, C. J., it
appeared that the injury set forth in the plaintiff’s declaration was
sustained by him, as therein alleged, on the 11th of June, 1843, being
the Lord’s day, in the forenoon of said day, as he was travelling from
Warren (R. I.), where he resided, to Fall River, on business connected
with the conduct of a cause then pending in the District Court of the
United States in Rhode Island. The defendants admitted that they
were by law bound to keep said highway in repair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge instructed the jury, that the plaintiff would not be entitled
to recover, unless he satisfied them that his travelling on the
Lord’s day was from necessity or for purposes of charity; that it being
admitted that his business was of a secular character, the burden was
upon him to show the necessity of transacting this business on the
Lord’s day.</p>

appear that the accident was occasioned exclusively by the defect of
the highway; to establish which, it must appear that the plaintiff himself
is free from all just imputation of negligence or fault. Smith <em>v.</em>
Smith, 2 Pick. 621; Howard <em>v.</em> North Bridgewater, 16 Pick. 189.
And in these and other cases, it has been held that the burden of proof
is on the plaintiff, to prove affirmatively that he was so free from all
fault. Adams <em>v.</em> Carlisle, 21 Pick. 146; Lane <em>v.</em> Crombie, 12 Pick.
177. The Court are of opinion that this case comes within this
principle. The Rev. Sts., c. 50, § 2, provide that “no person shall
travel on the Lord’s day, except from necessity or charity,” and that
“every person so offending shall be punished by a fine, not exceeding
ten dollars for every offence.” The act of the plaintiff, therefore, in
doing which the accident occurred, was plainly unlawful, unless he
could bring himself within the excepted cases; and this would be a
species of fault on his part, which would bring him within the principle
of the cases cited. It would show that his own unlawful act concurred
in causing the damage complained of. Then if he would bring
himself within either of the exceptions, he must prove the fact which
the statute makes an exception. In the case last above cited, Lane <em>v.</em>
Crombie, the verdict was set aside, because the judge instructed the
jury, that after the negligence of the defendants had been proved, if
they relied on want of due care on the part of the plaintiff, the burden
was upon them to prove it. This was held to be erroneous, and the
burden was decided to be on the plaintiff to prove herself free from
all fault. On this ground the verdict was set aside, although the evidence
was such that probably the direction in regard to burden of
proof had not much influence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court are therefor of opinion that the instruction of the judge
was right, that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to show that
his travelling on the Lord’s day was from necessity or for purposes
of charity.</p>

<p class='c007'>What constitutes such necessity or purpose of charity, are questions
not raised by the bill of exceptions.</p>

  <h5 class='c013'>SUTTON <em>v.</em> TOWN OF WAUWATOSA<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Wisconsin, June Term, 1871.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 29 Wisconsin Reports, 21.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Appeal from County Court for Milwaukee County.</p>

<p class='c007'>Action against a town to recover damages for injuries to plaintiff’s
cattle, caused by the breaking down of a defective bridge which they
were crossing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff started from Columbus on a Friday morning with a
drove of about fifty cattle, intending to take them to Milwaukee, and
sell them. Stopping at Hartland over Saturday night, he resumed his
journey on Sunday morning, and at about four o’clock, <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, reached
a public bridge of about seventy-two feet span, over the Menomonee
River, in the town of Wauwatosa. The cattle were driven upon the
bridge, and when the greater part of them were near the middle of the
span the stringers broke, some twelve feet from the abutments at each
end, and precipitated the structure, with the cattle upon it, into the
river, causing the death of some, severely injuring others, and rendering
the remainder for a time unsalable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The complaint alleges, that the injury was caused by the dangerous,
unsafe, and rotten condition of the bridge, and the neglect of the defendant
to keep it in proper repair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer denies the negligence charged to the defendant, and alleges
that the cattle were driven upon the bridge in so careless and
negligent a manner as to cause it to break; and, also, that they were
so driven upon the bridge on Sunday.</p>

<p class='c007'>After hearing the evidence on the part of the plaintiff, the Court
granted a nonsuit, on the ground that the plaintiff, being in the act of
violating the statute prohibiting the doing of secular business on Sunday,
when the injury occurred, could not recover therefor. The plaintiff
appealed.<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c015'><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dixon, C. J.</span> It is very clear that the plaintiff, in driving his cattle
along the road and over the bridge, to a market, on Sunday, was at the
time of the accident in the act of violating the provisions of the statute
of this State, which prohibits, under a penalty not exceeding two dollars
for each offence, the doing of any manner of labor, business, or
work on that day, except only works of necessity or charity, R. S.,
c. 183, § 5. It was upon this ground the nonsuit was directed by the
Court below, and the point thus presented, that the unlawful act of
the plaintiff was negligence, or a fault on his part contributing to the
injury, and which will preclude a recovery against the town, is not a
new one; nor is the law, as the Court below held it to be, without
some adjudications directly in its favor, and those by a judicial tribunal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>as eminent and much respected for its learning and ability as
any in this country. Bosworth <em>v.</em> Swansey, 10 Met. 363; Jones <em>v.</em>
Andover, 10 Allen, 18. A similar, if not the very same principle has
been maintained in other decisions of the same tribunal. Gregg <em>v.</em>
Wyman, 4 Cush. 322; May <em>v.</em> Foster, 1 Allen, 408. But in others
still, as we shall hereafter have occasion to observe, the same learned
Court has, as it appears to us, held to a different and contradictory
rule in a class of cases which it would seem ought obviously to be
governed by the same principle. The two first above cases were in all
material respects like the present, and it was held there could be no
recovery against the towns. In the first, the opinion, delivered by
Chief Justice Shaw, and which is very short, commences with a statement
of the proposition, repeatedly decided by that Court, “that to
maintain the action it must appear that the accident was occasioned
exclusively by the defect of the highway; to establish which, it must
appear that the plaintiff himself is free from all just imputation of
negligence or fault.” The authorities to this proposition are cited,
and the statute against the pursuit of secular business and travel on
the Lord’s day then referred to, and the opinion proceeds: “The act
of the plaintiff, therefore, in doing which the accident occurred, was
plainly unlawful, unless he could bring himself within the excepted
cases; and this would be a species of fault on his part which would
bring him within the principle of the cases cited. It would show
that his own unlawful act concurred in causing the damage complained
of.” This is all of the opinion touching the point under consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the next case there was a little, and but a little, more effort at
reasoning upon the point. The illustrations on page 20, of negligence
in a railway company in omitting to ring the bell of the engine, or to
sound the whistle at the crossing of a highway, and of the traveller on
the wrong side of the road with his vehicle at the time of the collision,
and the language of the Court alluding to such “conduct of the party
as contributing to the accident or injury which forms the groundwork
of the action,” very clearly indicate the true ground upon which the
doctrine of contributory negligence, or want of due care in the plaintiff,
rests, but it is not shown how or why the mere violation of a
statute by the plaintiff constitutes such ground. Upon this point the
Court only say: “It is true that no direct unlawful act of omission or
commission by the plaintiff, done at the moment when the accident
occurred, and tending immediately to produce it, is offered to be
shown in evidence. But it is also true that, if the plaintiff had not
been engaged in the doing of an unlawful act, the accident would not
have happened, and the negligence of the defendants in omitting to
keep the road in proper repair would not have contributed to produce
an injury to the plaintiff. It is the disregard of the requirements of
the statute by the plaintiff which constitutes the fault or want of due
care, which is fatal to the action.” It would seem from this language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>that the violation of the statute by the plaintiff is regarded only as a
species of remote negligence, or want of proper care on his part
contributing to the injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two other cases above cited were actions of tort by the owners,
to recover damages from the bailees for injuries to personal property
loaned and used on Sunday,—horses loaned and immoderately
driven on that day. They were decided against the plaintiffs, and
chiefly on the ground of the unlawfulness of the act of loaning or letting
on Sunday of the horses, to be driven on that day in violation of
the statute, which the plaintiffs themselves were obliged to show, and
the doctrine of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">par delictum</span></i> was applied. It was in substance held in
each case that the plaintiff, by the first wrong committed by him, had
placed himself <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in pari delicto</span></i> with the defendant, with respect to the
subsequent and distinct wrong committed by the latter, and the
actions were dismissed upon the principle that the law will not permit
a party to prove his own illegal acts in order to establish his case.</p>

<p class='c007'>In direct opposition to the above decisions are the numerous cases
decided by the Courts of other States, the Supreme Court of the
United States, and the Courts of Great Britain, which have been so
diligently collected and ably and forcibly presented in the brief of the
learned counsel for the present plaintiff. Of the cases thus cited, with
some others, we make particular note of the following: Woodman <em>v.</em>
Hubbard, 5 Foster, 67; Mohney <em>v.</em> Cook, 26 Penn. 342; Norris <em>v.</em>
Litchfield, 35 N. H. 271; Corey <em>v.</em> Bath, id. 530; Merritt <em>v.</em> Earle,
29 N. Y. 115; Bigelow <em>v.</em> Reed, 51 Maine, 325; Hamilton <em>v.</em> Goding,
55 id. 428; Baker <em>v.</em> The City of Portland, 58 id. 199; Kerwhacker
<em>v.</em> Railway Co., 3 Ohio St. 172; Phila., &amp;c. Railway Co. <em>v.</em> Phila.,
&amp;c. Tow Boat Co., 23 How. (U. S.) 209; Bird <em>v.</em> Holbrook, 4 Bing.
628; Barnes <em>v.</em> Ward, 9 M. G. &amp; S. 420.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems quite unnecessary, if indeed it were possible, to add anything
to the force or conclusiveness of the reasons assigned in some of
these cases in support of the views taken and decisions made by the
Courts. The cases may be summed up and the result stated generally
to be the affirmance of two very just and plain principles of law as applicable
to civil actions of this nature, namely: first, that one party to
the action, when called upon to answer for the consequences of his own
wrongful act done to the other, cannot allege or reply the separate or
distinct wrongful act of the other, done not to himself nor to his injury,
and not necessarily connected with, or leading to, or causing or
producing the wrongful act complained of; and, secondly, that the
fault, want of due care or negligence on the part of the plaintiff, which
will preclude a recovery for the injury complained of, as contributing
to it, must be some act or conduct of the plaintiff having the relation
to that injury of a cause to the effect produced by it. Under the
operation of the first principle, the defendant cannot exonerate himself
or claim immunity from the consequences of his own tortious act,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>voluntarily or negligently done to the injury of the plaintiff, on the
ground that the plaintiff has been guilty of some other and independent
wrong or violation of law. Wrongs or offences cannot be set
off against each other in this way. “But we should work a confusion
of relations, and lend a very doubtful assistance to morality,” say the
Court in Mohney <em>v.</em> Cook, “if we should allow one offender against
the law, to the injury of another, to set off against the plaintiff that
he too is a public offender.” Himself guilty of a wrong, not dependent
on nor caused by that charged against the plaintiff, but arising from
his own voluntary act or his neglect, the defendant cannot assume the
championship of public rights, nor to prosecute the plaintiff as an
offender against the laws of the State, and thus to impose upon him a
penalty many times greater than what those laws prescribe. Neither
justice nor sound morals require this, and it seems contrary to the
dictates of both that such a defence should be allowed to prevail. It
would extend the maxim, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex turpi causa non oritur actio</span></i>, beyond the
scope of its legitimate application, and violate the maxim, equally
binding and wholesome, and more extensive in its operation, that no
man shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong. To take
advantage of his own wrong, and to visit unmerited and over-rigorous
punishment upon the plaintiff, constitute the sole motive for such
defence on the part of the person making it. In the cases of the
horses let to be driven on Sunday, so far as the owners were obliged
to resort to an action on the contract which was executory and illegal,
of course there could be no recovery; but to an action of tort, founded
not on the contract, but on the tort or wrong subsequently committed
by the defendant, the illegality of the contract furnished no defence,
as is clearly demonstrated in Woodman <em>v.</em> Hubbard, and the cases
there cited. The decisions under the provision of the constitution of
this State abolishing imprisonment for debt arising out of or founded
on a contract express or implied, and some others in this Court
strongly illustrate the same distinction. In re Mowry, 12 Wis. 52,
56, 57; Cotton <em>v.</em> Sharpstein, 14 Wis. 229, 230; Schennert <em>v.</em> Kœhler,
23 Wis. 523, 527.</p>

<p class='c007'>And as to the other principle, that the act or conduct of the plaintiff
which can be imputed to him as a fault, want of due care or negligence
on his part contributing to the injury, must have some connection with
the injury as cause to effect, this also seems almost too clear to require
thought or elaboration. To make good the defence on this ground, it
must appear that a relation existed between the act or violation of law
on the part of the plaintiff, and the injury or accident of which he
complains, and that relation must have been such as to have caused or
helped to cause the injury or accident, not in a remote or speculative
sense, but in the natural and ordinary course of events as one event is
known to precede or follow another. It must have been some act,
omission, or fault naturally and ordinarily calculated to produce the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>injury, or from which the injury or accident might naturally and
reasonably have been anticipated under the circumstances. It is obvious
that a violation of the Sunday law is not of itself an act, omission,
or fault of this kind, with reference to a defect in the highway
or in a bridge over which a traveller may be passing, unlawfully
though it may be. The fact that the traveller may be violating this
law of the State, has no natural or necessary tendency to cause the
injury which may happen to him from the defect. All other conditions
and circumstances remaining the same, the same accident or
injury would have happened on any other day as well. The same
natural causes would have produced the same result on any other day,
and the time of the accident or injury, as that it was on Sunday, is
wholly immaterial so far as the cause of it or the question of contributory
negligence is concerned. In this respect it would be wholly
immaterial also that the traveller was within the exceptions of the
statute, and travelling on an errand of necessity or charity, and so
was lawfully upon the highway.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mere matter of time, when an injury like this takes place, is not
in general an element which does or can enter at all into the consideration
of the cause of it. Time and place are circumstances necessary in
order that any event may happen or transpire, but they are not ordinarily,
if they ever are, circumstances of cause in transactions of this
nature. There may be concurrence or connection of time and place
between two or three or more events, and yet one event not have the
remotest influence in causing or producing either of the others. A
traveller on the highway, contrary to the provisions of the statute, yet
peaceably and quietly pursuing his course, might be assaulted and
robbed by a highwayman. It would be difficult in such case to perceive
how the highwayman could connect the unlawful act of the traveller
with his assault and robbery so as to justify or excuse them, or
how it could be said, that the former had any natural or legitimate
tendency to cause or produce the latter. It is true, it might be said, if
the traveller had not been present at that particular time or place, he
would not have been assaulted and robbed, but that too might be said
of any other assault or robbery committed upon him; for if his presence
at one time and place be a fault or wrong on his part, contributing
to the assault and robbery in the nature of cause to effect, it must
be equally so at every other time and place, and so always a defence in
the mouth of the highwayman. Every highwayman must have his
opportunity by the passing of some traveller, and so some one must
pass over a rotten and unsafe bridge or defective highway before any
accident or injury can happen from that cause. Connection, therefore,
merely in point of time, between the unlawful act or fault of
the plaintiff, and the wrong or omission of the defendant, the same
being in other respects disconnected and independent acts or events,
does not suffice to establish contributory negligence or to defeat the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>plaintiff’s action on that ground. As observed in Mohney <em>v.</em> Cook,
such connection, if looked upon as in any sense a cause, whether sacred
and mysterious or otherwise, clearly falls under the rule <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">causa proxima
non remota spectatur</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The cause of an event,” says Appleton, C. J., in Moulton <em>v.</em> Sanford,
51 Maine, 134, “is the sum total of the contingencies of every
description, which, being realized, the event invariably follows. It is
rare, if ever, that the invariable sequence of events subsists between
one antecedent and one consequent. Ordinarily that condition is
usually termed the cause, whose share in the matter is the most conspicuous
and is the most immediately preceding and proximate to the
event.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present case the weight of the same cattle, upon the same
bridge, either the day before or the day after the event complained of,
when the plaintiff would have been guilty of no violation of law in
driving them, would most unquestionably have produced the same injurious
result. And if, on that day even, the driving had been a work
of necessity or charity, as if the city of Milwaukee had been in great
part destroyed by fire, as Chicago recently was, and great numbers of
her inhabitants in a condition of helplessness and starvation, and the
plaintiff hurrying up his drove of beef cattle for their relief, no one
doubts the same accident would then have happened, and the same injuries
have ensued. The law of gravitation would not then have been
suspended, nor would the rotten and defective stringers have refused
to give way under the superincumbent weight, precisely as they did do
on the present occasion. There are many other violations of law,
which the traveller or other person passing along the highway may, at
the time he receives an injury from a defect in it, be in the act of committing,
and which are quite as closely connected with the injury, or
the cause of it, as is the violation of which complaint is made against
the present plaintiff. He may be engaged in cruelly beating or torturing
his horse, or ox, or other animal; he may be in the pursuit of game,
with intent to kill or destroy it, at a season of the year when this is
prohibited; he may be exposing game for sale, or have it in his possession,
when these are unlawful; he may be in the act of committing
an assault, or resisting an officer; he may be fraudulently passing a
toll gate, without paying his toll; and he may be unlawfully setting
or using a net or seine, for the purpose of catching fish, in an inland
lake or stream.</p>

<p class='c007'>All of these are acts prohibited by the same chapter or statute in
which we find the prohibition from work and labor on Sunday, and
some of them under the same, but most under a greater penalty than
is prescribed for that offence, thus showing the character or degree of
culpability which was variously attached to them in the opinion of the
legislature. And there are many other minor offences, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mala prohibita</span></i>
merely, created by statute, which might be in like manner committed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>There are in Massachusetts, and doubtless in many of the States, statutes
against blasphemy and profane cursing and swearing, the prevention
of which seems to be equally if not more an object of solicitude
and care on the part of the legislature, than the prevention of labor,
travel, or other secular pursuits on Sunday, because more severely
punished. It has not yet transpired, we believe, even in Massachusetts,
that the action of any person to recover damages for an
injury sustained by reason of defects in a highway, has been peremptorily
dismissed because he was engaged at the time in profane
cursing or swearing, or because he was in a state of voluntary intoxication,
likewise prohibited under penalty by statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is obvious that the breaking down of a bridge from the rottenness
of the timbers, or their inability to sustain the weight of the person or
of his horses and carriage, could not be affected by either of these circumstances,
and yet, on the principle of the decisions above referred
to in that State, it is not easy to see why the action must not be dismissed.
On principle there could be no discrimination between the
cases, and it could make no difference in what the unlawful act of the
plaintiff consisted at the time of receiving the injury. We must reject
the doctrine of those cases entirely and adopt that of the other
cases cited, and which is well expressed by the Supreme Court of
Maine, in Baker <em>v.</em> Portland, 58 Maine, 199, 204, as follows: “The
defendant’s counsel contends that the simple fact that the plaintiff is
in the act of violating the law, at the time of the injury, is a bar to
the right of recovery. Undoubtedly there are many cases where the
contemporaneous violation of the law by the plaintiff is so connected
with his claim for damages as to preclude his recovery: but to lay
down such a rule as the counsel claims, and disregard the distinction
in the ruling of which he complains, would be productive oftentimes
of palpable injustice. The fact that a party plaintiff in an action of
this description was at the time of the injury passing another wayfarer
on the wrong side of the street, or without giving him half the
road, or that he was travelling on runners without bells, in contravention
of the statute, or that he was smoking a cigar in the street, in
violation of municipal ordinance, while it might subject the offender
to a penalty, will not excuse the town for a neglect to make its way
safe and convenient for travellers, if the commission of the plaintiff’s
offence did not in any degree contribute to produce the injury of
which he complains.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Strong analogy is afforded and much weight and force of reason
bearing upon this question are found in some of the cases which have
arisen upon life policies, and as to the meaning and effect to be given
to the condition usually contained in them, exempting the company
from liability in case the assured “shall die in the known violation of
any law,” &amp;c., and it has been held that the violation must be such as
is calculated to endanger life, by leading to acts of violence against,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>or to the bodily or personal injury or exposure of, the assured, and so
to operate in producing his death in the connection of cause to effect.
See opinions in Bradley <em>v.</em> Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co., 45 N. Y.
422.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of Clemens <em>v.</em> Clemens, recently decided by this Court,
it became necessary to consider the same question, though under different
circumstances, as to what violation of law on the part of the
plaintiff would bar his action in a Court of justice and leave him
remediless in the hands of an overreaching and dishonest antagonist,
and the views there expressed are not without their relevancy and
adaptation to the question as here presented. In that case, this Court
adopted the rule of law as settled in Massachusetts, favoring the remedy
of the plaintiff, against the opposite rule sustained by the adjudications
in some of the other States, and consistency of decision seems
now clearly to require that our action should be reserved with respect
to the rule established by the cases here referred to. The inconsistency
upon general principle between these decisions of the same learned
Court and those there relied upon and adopted, will, we think, be
readily perceived and conceded when carefully examined and considered
in connection with each other.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>STEELE <em>v.</em> BURKHARDT<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, March, 1870.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 104 Massachusetts Reports, 59.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Tort for injury alleged to have been caused to the plaintiffs’ horse
by the negligence of the defendant’s servant; submitted to the judgment
of the Superior Court, and, on appeal, of this Court, upon the
following award of an arbitrator as upon a statement of agreed
facts:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I find that the injury to the plaintiffs’ horse, for which they seek
to recover damages in this action, was occasioned by the negligence
and want of due care of the defendant’s servant, then in the employment
of the defendant. At the time of the injury, the plaintiffs’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>wagon, to which the injured horse was attached, was placed in Clinton
Street in the city of Boston, by the plaintiffs’ driver, having the
care of the wagon for the loading of certain articles, the weight of
which in each and every package thereof was less than five hundred
pounds; and the wagon was then wholly or in part backed and placed
across Clinton Street, and thereby the plaintiffs were guilty of a violation
of an ordinance of the city, which provides as follows: ‘And
for the loading or unloading of any dirt, bricks, stones, sand, gravel,
or of any articles, whether of the same description or not, the weight
of which in any one package shall be less than five hundred pounds,
no truck, cart, wagon, sleigh, sled, or other vehicle shall be wholly or
in part backed or placed across any street, square, lane, or alley, or
upon flag-stones or crossings of the same, but shall be placed lengthwise,
and as near as possible to the abutting stone of the sidewalk or
footway; and any owner or driver or other person having the care of
any such vehicle, violating either of the provisions of this section,
shall be liable to a fine of not less than five dollars, nor more than
twenty dollars, for each offence.’ It is in evidence that, at the time
of the injury, there was sufficient room, with proper care, for the defendant’s
team to pass through Clinton Street (a greater degree of
care being required by reason of the position of the plaintiffs’ team
as aforesaid, but not greater than the defendant was bound to use, in
my judgment), but the defendant’s servant, in passing between the
plaintiffs’ horse and the opposite curbstone, ran over and upon the
hoof of the plaintiff’s horse, with a heavy team, and in so doing was
guilty of the negligence which I report; and I further find, that the
only fault upon the part of the plaintiffs is the fact of their horse and
wagon having been placed against the curb in violation of the city
ordinance above mentioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In case the Court shall find, under the foregoing statement of
facts, that the violation hereinbefore mentioned of said ordinance, on
the part of the plaintiffs’ driver, debarred the plaintiffs from maintaining
their action for damages, my award would be judgment for the
defendant for his costs of court, with the costs of this reference;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>otherwise, my award would be for the plaintiffs, for the sum of $225
and their costs of court.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Chapman, C. J.</span> The act complained of by the plaintiffs is, that
while their horse was standing on Clinton Street, the defendant’s
servant, while driving a heavy team along the street, carelessly drove
it upon the hoof of the plaintiffs’ horse, and injured him. The award,
which the parties have agreed to accept as a statement of facts, finds
that the injury was occasioned by negligence and want of due care in
the defendant’s servant. The terms of this finding imply that there
was no negligence on the part of the plaintiffs, which contributed to
the injury. And it is further found that, though the plaintiffs’ team
was standing there in violation of a city ordinance, yet there was
room for the defendant’s team to pass by, using due care, and the
only fault of the plaintiffs consisted in the violation of the city ordinance.
It is not found that this violation contributed to the injury.
It is said by Bigelow, C. J., in Jones <em>v.</em> Andover, 10 Allen, 20, that,
“in case of a collision of two vehicles on a highway, evidence that the
plaintiff was travelling on the left side of the road, in violation of
the statute, when he met the defendant, would be admissible to show
negligence.” So the evidence that the plaintiffs’ team was standing
in the street in violation of a city ordinance was admissible to show
negligence on their part. It did show negligence in respect to keeping
the ordinance, but did not necessarily show negligence that contributed
to the injury. And, notwithstanding this evidence, it was
competent to the arbitrator to find, as a fact, that, towards the defendant,
the plaintiffs were guilty of no negligence, but were careful to
leave him ample room to pass. He did so find in substance; and his
finding is agreed to as a fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>A collision on the highway sometimes happens, when both parties
are in motion, and both are active in producing it. In such cases, the
plaintiff must prove that he was not moving carelessly. But the collision
sometimes happens, as in this case, when the plaintiffs’ team is
standing still. In such a case, he must prove that his position was
not so carelessly taken as to contribute to the collision. The fact is
here found that it was not so taken, though it was in violation of the
ordinance. There was therefore no such negligence on his part as to
defeat the action.</p>

<p class='c007'>Actions founded on negligence are governed by a plain principle.
The plaintiffs’ declaration alleges that the injury happened in consequence
of the negligence of the defendant. This is held to imply that
there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff which contributed
to the injury; and to throw upon him the burden of proving the truth
of the allegation. It may depend upon care exercised by himself personally,
or by his coachman, if he is riding; or by his teamster, in his
absence; or by the person in charge of him, if he is an invalid, or an
infant of tender years, or in any way so situated as to need the care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>of another person in respect to the matter. If there was want of care,
either on the part of himself or the person acting for him, and the
injury is partly attributable directly to that cause, he cannot recover,
simply because he cannot prove what he has alleged. Among the
numerous cases sustaining this view are, Parker <em>v.</em> Adams, 12 Met.
415; Horton <em>v.</em> Ipswich, 12 Cush. 488; Holly <em>v.</em> Boston Gas Light
Co., 8 Gray, 131; Wright <em>v.</em> Malden &amp; Melrose Railroad Co., 4 Allen,
283; Callahan <em>v.</em> Bean, 9 Allen, 401.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is further contended that these plaintiffs are compelled to
prove their own violation of law in order to establish their case, and
therefore the action cannot be maintained. The substance of the ordinance
referred to is, that for loading and unloading packages weighing
less than five hundred pounds, wagons shall stand lengthwise of
streets, and not crosswise, under a prescribed penalty. The plaintiffs
were loading packages of less weight, and their wagon was standing
crosswise of the street. But proof of the weight of these packages was
not necessary. In this respect the case is like that of Welch <em>v.</em> Wesson,
6 Gray, 505, where the plaintiff was injured while he was trotting
his horse illegally. It is unlike the cases of Gregg <em>v.</em> Wyman, 4 Cush.
322, and Way <em>v.</em> Foster, 1 Allen, 408, which were decided in favor of
the defendant upon the ground that the plaintiff was obliged to lay
the foundation of his action in his own violation of law. Even in
those cases, the violation of law by the plaintiffs would not have justified
an assault and battery or a false imprisonment of the plaintiffs.
In this case, if the packages had weighed more than five hundred
pounds, the position of the team would have been the same. In
Spofford <em>v.</em> Harlow, 3 Allen, 176, it was held that, though the plaintiff’s
sleigh was on the wrong side of the street, in violation of law,
the defendant was liable, if his servant ran into the plaintiff carelessly
and recklessly, the plaintiff’s negligence not contributing to the injury.
And it is true generally, that while no person can maintain an action
to which he must trace his title through his own breach of the law,
yet the fact that he is breaking the law does not leave him remediless
for injuries wilfully or carelessly done to him, and to which his own
conduct has not contributed.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>NEWCOMB <em>v.</em> BOSTON PROTECTIVE DEPARTMENT<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, January 25, 1888.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 146 Massachusetts Reports, 596.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Tort for personal injuries occasioned to the plaintiff, a cab-driver,
by a collision between the cab and a wagon of the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial in the Superior Court, before Blodgett, J., evidence was
introduced tending to show that the defendant was incorporated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>under the St. of 1874, c. 61,<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c015'><sup>[248]</sup></a> for the protection of life and property at
fires in the city of Boston, and that the collision occurred while one of
its wagons, with its regular complement of men, was responding to a
fire alarm; that the wagon was proceeding along Washington Street in
a northerly direction; that the cab, upon which the plaintiff was
sitting, was one of several cabs standing in a line upon the easterly
side of Washington Street between the easterly track of a street railway
and the curbstone; that the plaintiff’s cab and horse were not
drawn up lengthwise of the street and as near as possible to the curbstone,
but that the horse was facing the sidewalk at an angle so that
the body of the cab projected eighteen or twenty inches into the street
beyond the line of the other cabs; and that the wagon of the defendant
was driven negligently into the cab, causing the accident.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant asked the judge to instruct the jury as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. If the plaintiff, at the time of the accident, was violating the
ordinance of the city of Boston, to wit, ‘Every owner, driver, or other
person having the care and ordering of a vehicle shall, when stopping
in a street, place his vehicle and the horse or horses connected therewith
lengthwise with the street, as near as possible to the sidewalk,’
that was an unlawful act, and he cannot recover in this action. 2. If
that unlawful act contributed to cause the alleged injury, the plaintiff
was not in the exercise of due care, and therefore he cannot maintain
this action. 3. Under section 3, chapter 61, of the Acts of 1874,
‘The officers and men of the Boston Protective Department, with
their teams and apparatus, shall have the right of way, while going to
a fire, through any street, lane, or alley in the city of Boston,’ said
defendant is not liable for an accident caused by the collision of one of
its teams, while going to a fire, with a vehicle standing in the streets, in
violation of either of the city ordinances. 4. If the plaintiff, at the
time of the action, was violating the ordinance of the city of Boston,
to wit, ‘Every driver of a vehicle shall remain near it while it is unemployed
or standing in a street, unless he is necessarily absent in the
course of his duty and business, and he shall so keep his horse or
horses and vehicle as not to obstruct the streets,’ that was an unlawful
act, and he cannot recover in this action. 5. If that unlawful act contributed
to cause the alleged injury, the plaintiff was not in the
exercise of due care, and therefore he cannot maintain this action.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge refused to give these instructions, but instructed the jury
as to the effect of a violation of the ordinance as to the position of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>vehicle and horse while standing in a street, stating that the rule was
applicable to both ordinances as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bearing in mind the provision of the regulation as to the position
of a vehicle when not in motion, I instruct you as to the law, that if,
at the time of the injury to the plaintiff, he allowed his carriage to
stand in the street in violation of this ordinance, such violation is evidence
of negligence on his part; and, if such negligence directly contributed
to the injury, the plaintiff cannot maintain the action. It
cannot be said, as matter of law, that the fact that the plaintiff was
violating a city ordinance necessarily shows negligence that contributed
to the injury. Whether the position of the plaintiff’s horse and
carriage, in violation of an ordinance, did or did not contribute to the
injury, is a question of fact for the jury; and in determining this
question, the jury will take into consideration all the surrounding
facts and circumstances.... The plaintiff must prove that his position
was not so carelessly taken as to contribute to the collision; and
the fact that his position was in violation of the ordinance is not conclusive
proof of negligence which contributed to the injury. Or, stating
the general rule in a somewhat different form, the fact that the
plaintiff is engaged in violating the law does not prevent him from
recovering damages of the defendant for an injury which the defendant
could have avoided by the exercise of ordinary care, unless the
unlawful act contributed proximately to produce the injury.... If,
applying these rules, you are of the opinion that there was no negligence,
in other words, no carelessness, on the part of the plaintiff,
which directly contributed to the injury, then the plaintiff is entitled
to maintain this action, if he proves another proposition; and as to
that, the burden is upon him. And that proposition is, that the defendant’s
servants, in the care and management of this wagon, at the
time the plaintiff was injured, were negligent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant
alleged exceptions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Knowlton, J.</span> The plaintiff brought his action to recover for injuries
received while sitting upon his cab, from the negligent driving
of a wagon against it by a servant of the defendant corporation. There
was evidence tending to show that, at the time of the accident, he was
violating an ordinance of the city of Boston, by waiting in a street
without placing his vehicle and horse lengthwise with the street, as
near as possible to the sidewalk, and that this illegal conduct contributed
to the injury. There was evidence applicable in like manner to
another similar ordinance, which requires every driver of a vehicle
standing in a street so to keep his horse or horses and vehicle as not
to obstruct the streets.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the alleged violation of each of these ordinances, the defendant
asked the Court to instruct the jury as follows: “If that unlawful
act contributed to cause the alleged injury, the plaintiff was not in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>exercise of due care, and therefore he cannot maintain this action.”
The presiding judge declined to give this instruction, and gave none
which we deem to be equivalent to it. He instructed the jury in these
words: “If, at the time of the injury to the plaintiff, he allowed his
carriage to stand in the street in violation of this ordinance, such
violation is evidence of negligence on his part; and, if such negligence
directly contributed to the injury, the plaintiff cannot maintain the action.
It cannot be said, as matter of law, that the fact that the plaintiff
was violating a city ordinance necessarily shows negligence that
contributed to the injury.” In another part of the charge it was
indirectly intimated that, if the plaintiff’s unlawful act contributed
proximately to produce the injury, he could not recover, but it was
nowhere expressly stated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question before us then is, whether or not the defendant was
entitled to this instruction,—in other words, whether, if the plaintiff’s
unlawful act contributed to cause his injury, it was a bar to his
recovery, or merely evidence of negligence which might or might not
bar him, according to the view which the jury should take of his conduct
as a whole, in its relation to the accident.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has often been held that a violation of law at the time of an accident,
by one connected with it, is evidence of his negligence, but not
conclusive. Hanlon <em>v.</em> South Boston Horse Railroad, 129 Mass. 310;
Hall <em>v.</em> Ripley, 119 Mass. 135; Damon <em>v.</em> Scituate, 119 Mass. 66.
In recent times a large number of penal statutes have been enacted,
in which the legislature has seen fit to punish acts which are not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mala
in se</span></i>, and sometimes when in a given case there is no actual criminal
intent. On grounds of public policy, laws have been passed under
which a person is bound to know the facts in regard to the subject
with which he is dealing, when under possible circumstances ignorance
would not be inconsistent with proper care. One who sells milk must
know that it is not adulterated. An unlicensed person must know that
what he sells is not intoxicating liquor. Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Boynton,
2 Allen, 160. And if in a possible case he trespasses in innocent ignorance,
the law gives him no relief. He can only appeal to the sense
of justice and the discretion of the public authorities to save him from
the punishment which the law would inflict. It is obvious that in
suits for negligence, if the contributing conduct of the plaintiff is to
be considered as a whole, it may sometimes be found that he has not
been guilty of actual negligence or fault, although he has violated the
law. One element of his action may be neglect of a duty prescribed by
a statute, when there are other concurring elements which show that
his course was entirely justifiable.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a general rule, in deciding a question in relation to negligence,
each element which enters as a factor into one’s act to give it character
is to be considered in connection with every other, and the result is
reached by considering all together. But, for reasons which will presently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>appear, illegal conduct of a plaintiff directly contributing to the
occurrence on which his action is founded, is an exception to this rule.
Such illegality may be viewed in either of two aspects: looking at the
transaction to which it pertains as a whole, it may be considered as a
circumstance bearing upon the question whether there was actual negligence;
or looking at it simply in reference to the violated law, the
act may be tried solely by the test of that law. In the latter aspect it
wears a hostile garb, and an inquiry is at once suggested, whether the
plaintiff, as a transgressor of the law, is in a position to obtain relief
at the hand of the law. In the first view, the illegal conduct comes
within the general rule just stated; in the second, it does not. This
distinction has not always been observed. A plaintiff’s violation of
law has usually been discussed in connection with the subject of due
care.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Bosworth <em>v.</em> Swansey, 10 Met. 363, Chief Justice Shaw, after referring
to the rule that a plaintiff must be free from “imputation of
negligence or fault,” says, in reference to unlawful travelling on the
Lord’s day, “This would be a species of fault on his part, which would
bring him within the principle of the cases cited.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Jones <em>v.</em> Andover, 10 Allen, 18, Chief Justice Bigelow says,
“The term ‘due care,’ as usually understood, in cases where the gist
of the action is the negligence of the defendant, implies not only that
a party has not been negligent or careless, but that he has been guilty
of no violation of law in relation to the subject-matter or transaction
which constitutes the cause of action.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Steele <em>v.</em> Burkhardt, 104 Mass. 59, an action for negligence in
driving against the plaintiffs’ horse, which was left standing in a street
in violation of an ordinance, Chief Justice Chapman considers the
general subject of the plaintiffs’ due care, and then treats particularly
the contention of the defendant that the plaintiffs were compelled to
prove their violation of law in order to establish their case.</p>

<p class='c007'>McGrath <em>v.</em> Merwin, 112 Mass. 467, was an action founded on the
defendant’s alleged negligence in starting the machinery of a mill,
while the plaintiff was at work in the wheel-pit making repairs on the
Lord’s day, and Mr. Justice Morton, in delivering the opinion, deals
with the case solely upon the principle that Courts will not aid a plaintiff
whose action is founded upon his own illegal act, and says, “The
decisions in this Commonwealth are numerous and uniform to the
effect that the plaintiff, being engaged in a violation of law, cannot
recover, if his own illegal act was an essential element of his case as
disclosed upon all the evidence.” He further states the rule in such
cases to be, that, “if the illegal act of the plaintiff contributed to his
injury, he cannot recover; but though the plaintiff at the time of the
injury was acting in violation of law, if his illegal act did not contribute
to the injury, but was independent of it, he is not precluded
thereby from recovering.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>In Davis <em>v.</em> Guarnieri, 45 Ohio St. 470, Owen, C. J., states, as the
second of three considerations upon which the doctrine of contributory
negligence is founded, “the principle which requires every suitor who
seeks to enforce his rights or redress his wrongs to go into court with
clean hands, and which will not permit him to recover for his own
wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No case has been brought to our attention, and upon careful investigation
we have found none, in which a plaintiff whose violation of law
contributed directly and proximately to cause him an injury has been
permitted to recover for it; and the decisions are numerous to the contrary.
Hall <em>v.</em> Ripley, 119 Mass. 135; Banks <em>v.</em> Highland Street
Railway, 136 Mass. 485; Tuttle <em>v.</em> Lawrence, 119 Mass. 276, 278;
Lyons <em>v.</em> Desotelle, 124 Mass. 387; Heland <em>v.</em> Lowell, 3 Allen, 407;
Steele <em>v.</em> Burkhardt, 104 Mass. 59; Damon <em>v.</em> Scituate, 119 Mass.
66; Marble <em>v.</em> Ross, 124 Mass. 44; Smith <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Maine Railroad,
120 Mass. 490. And it is quite immaterial whether or not a
plaintiff’s unlawful act contributing to his injury is negligent or
wrong when considered in all its relations. He is precluded from
recovering on the ground that the Court will not lend its aid to one
whose violation of law is the foundation of his claim. Hall <em>v.</em> Corcoran,
107 Mass. 251.</p>

<p class='c007'>While this principle is universally recognized, there is great practical
difficulty in applying it. The best minds often differ upon the
question whether, in a given case, illegal conduct of a plaintiff was a
direct and proximate cause contributing with others to his injury, or
was a mere condition of it; or, to state the question in another way,
appropriate to the reason of the rule, whether or not his own illegal
act is an essential element of his case as disclosed upon all the evidence.
Upon this point it is not easy to reconcile the cases. It has
been unanimously decided that in Gregg <em>v.</em> Wyman, 4 Cush. 322, there
was error in holding a plaintiff’s illegal conduct to be an essential
element of his case, when in fact it was merely incidental to it. Hall
<em>v.</em> Corcoran, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra</span></i>. But whatever criticisms may have been made
upon the decisions or the assumptions in certain cases, that illegal
action of a plaintiff contributed to the result, or was to be treated as a
concurring cause, or upon language in disregard of the distinction
between a cause and a condition, there has been none upon the doctrine
that, when a plaintiff’s illegal conduct does directly contribute
to his injury, it is fatal to his recovery of damages. Baker <em>v.</em> Portland,
58 Maine, 199; Norris <em>v.</em> Litchfield, 35 N. H. 271; Sutton <em>v.</em>
Wauwatosa, 29 Wis. 21.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff relies with great confidence upon the case of Hanlon <em>v.</em>
South Boston Horse Railroad, 129 Mass. 310, in which the presiding
judge at the trial refused to rule, that, “if the defendant was driving
at a rate of speed prohibited by the ordinance of the city of Boston,
and this speed contributed to the injury, this fact would itself constitute
negligence on the part of the defendant, and would entitle the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>plaintiff to recover if he was in the exercise of due care,” and his refusal
was held right by this Court. In giving the opinion, after pointing
out that driving at a rate of speed forbidden by the ordinance
might have occurred without fault of the driver, and might have been
justified by circumstances authorizing the jury to find that there was
no negligence, Mr. Justice Colt said, “It is not true that, if an unlawful
rate of speed contributed to the injury, that alone would give the
plaintiff a right to recover, if he was without fault.” There are intimations,
without adjudication, to the same effect, in Wright <em>v.</em> Malden
&amp; Melrose Railroad, 4 Allen, 283, and in Lane <em>v.</em> Atlantic Works, 111
Mass. 136. See also Kirby <em>v.</em> Boylston Market Association, 14 Gray,
249; Heeney <em>v.</em> Sprague, 11 R. I. 456; Brown <em>v.</em> Buffalo &amp; State
Line Railroad, 22 N. Y. 191; Flynn <em>v.</em> Canton Co., 40 Md. 312.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there is nothing in the language used in Hanlon <em>v.</em> South Boston
Horse Railroad inconsistent with the principle which we have
already stated. That decision related to the liability of a defendant.
It may be, where a penal statute does not purport to create a civil liability,
or to protect the rights of particular persons, that a violation of
it will not subject the violator to an action for damages, unless his act,
when viewed in connection with all the attendant circumstances, appears
to be negligent or wrongful. And at the same time Courts may
well hold that, in the sanctuary of the law, a violator of law imploring
relief from the consequences of his own transgression will receive no
favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The instruction requested in the case at bar would have become applicable
only upon a finding by the jury that the plaintiff’s unlawful
act contributed to cause the injury. The jury may have so found;
and we are of opinion that upon such a finding, irrespective of the
question whether viewed in all its aspects his act was negligent or not,
the Court could not properly permit him to recover. The instruction,
therefore, should have been given.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court rightly refused the instruction requested, that the plaintiff
could not recover if at the time of the accident he was violating the
ordinance, and so doing an unlawful act. This request ignored the
distinction between illegality which is a cause, and illegality which is
a condition of a transaction relied on by a plaintiff, or between that
which is an essential element of his case when all the facts appear, and
that which is no part of it, but only an attendant circumstance. The
position of a vehicle, which has been struck by another, may or may
not have been one of the causes of the striking. Of course it could not
have been struck if it had not been in the place where the blow came.
But this is a statement of an essential condition, and not of a cause of
the impact. The distinction is between that which directly and proximately
produces, or helps to produce, a result as an efficient cause,
and that which is a necessary condition or attendant circumstance of
it. If the position of the plaintiff’s vehicle was such as, in connection
with ordinary and usual concurring causes, would naturally produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>such an accident, that indicates that it contributed to it. But even in
that case, external causes may have been so exclusive in their operation,
and so free from any relation to the position of the vehicle, as to
have left that a mere condition, without agency in producing the result.
What is a contributing cause of an accident is usually a question
for a jury, to be determined by the facts of the particular case; and
such it has been held to be in many cases like the one before us.
Damon <em>v.</em> Scituate, 119 Mass. 66; Hall <em>v.</em> Ripley, 119 Mass. 135;
Welch <em>v.</em> Wesson, 6 Gray, 505; Spofford <em>v.</em> Harlow, 3 Allen, 176;

Norris <em>v.</em> Litchfield, 35 N. H. 271; Sutton <em>v.</em> Wauwatosa, 29 Wis. 21.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant’s third request for an instruction was rightly refused,
for reasons which have already been stated. The statute referred to
does not relieve the defendant from liability for negligence to a plaintiff
whose unlawful act or want of due care does not contribute to his
injury. In the opinion of a majority of the Court the entry must be—</p>

<h5 class='c013'>HEMMING <em>v.</em> CITY OF NEW HAVEN<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court of Errors, Connecticut, January 4, 1910.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 82 Connecticut Reports, 661.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Roraback, J.</span> On September 21st, 1907, Ley &amp; Company, electrical
contractors, were constructing a conduit on Chapel Street in New
Haven, under a contract with the United Illuminating Company, for
the purpose of laying its underground system of wiring in said highway,
and for that purpose had caused an excavation to be made on
Chapel Street. On September 21st an automobile owned by the plaintiff,
and driven by him personally, came through Temple Street in a
southerly direction and ran into this excavation, causing the injuries
described in the complaint. This automobile had been purchased by
the plaintiff on July 27th, 1906, of one Holcombe. Prior thereto
the plaintiff had owned another automobile, which was duly registered
by the secretary of State, pursuant to the statute then in force. The
plaintiff had not made application to the secretary of State for registration
of the automobile last purchased, until September 21st, 1907,
when he mailed his application, enclosing his check for registration
fee, at the post-office in New Haven, to the secretary of State, by
whom it was received on September 23d, 1907. On September 28th,
1907, a certificate of registration for the automobile driven by the
plaintiff at the time of the accident was issued by the secretary of
State, as provided for by law. The registration mark displayed by the
plaintiff at the time of the accident bore the number which had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>assigned to him as the owner of another automobile owned by him,
and which had been disposed of prior to the accident.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reasons of appeal relied upon are that the court erred in refusing
to charge as requested, and in the charge as given.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant requested the court to instruct the jury as follows:
“The burden of proof is on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance
of the evidence that at the time of the accident he had the authority
of the State of Connecticut to use his machine on the highways of the
State, and if the plaintiff does not prove that he had such authority
and license, he cannot recover, and your verdict should be for the
defendant. If at the time of the accident the plaintiff did not have
the authority of the State of Connecticut to use his automobile described
in the complaint on the highways of the State, he cannot recover
and your verdict should be for the defendant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The court declined to give these rulings, but instructed the jury
that the plaintiff’s failure to register would not of itself bar his right
to recover, since the law does not provide that one who fails to register
his automobile cannot make use of it upon the highway. “The failure
of the plaintiff to register his automobile cannot be held to tend to
prove contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, unless you
find that such conduct was illegal, and that it directly contributed to
the accident upon which this case is founded; that is, unless you find
it to have been the cause, or one of the causes, of this accident; and
no such claim, that is, that this did directly contribute to the accident,
is made in this case as I understand the contention of counsel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The statute relative to automobiles then in force (Public Acts of
1907, chap. 221, pp. 821 to 828), provides, in § 2, for the registering
of automobiles and the placing of numbers on machines so registered.
The penalty to any person having failed to register or display his
number was not more than $100, or imprisonment not more than
thirty days, or both.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff was violating the statute relating to the registration
of automobiles, but that fact does not relieve the defendant. This
statute imposed an obligation upon the plaintiff to register his automobile,
and for its violation prescribed a penalty. The statute goes no
further, and it cannot be held that the right to maintain an action for
damages resulting from the omission of the defendant to perform a
public duty is taken away because the person injured was at the time
his injuries were sustained disobeying a statute law which in no way
contributed to the accident. A traveller with an unregistered and unnumbered
automobile is not made a trespasser upon the street, neither
does it necessarily follow that the property which he owns is outside
of legal protection when injured by the unlawful acts of another.
“There is some real and more apparent conflict of opinion in the
many cases treating of the relation between an illegal act and a coincident
injury. In doing an unlawful act a person does not necessarily
put himself outside the protection of the law. He is not barred of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>redress for an injury suffered by himself, nor liable for an injury suffered
by another, merely because he is a lawbreaker. In actions to
recover for injuries not intentionally inflicted but resulting from a
breach of duty which another owed to the party injured—commonly
classed as actions for negligence—the fact that the plaintiff or defendant
at the time of the injury was a lawbreaker may possibly be
relevant as an incidental circumstance, but is otherwise immaterial
unless the act of violating the law is in itself a breach of duty to the
party injured in respect to the injury suffered.” Monroe <em>v.</em> Hartford
Street Ry. Co., 76 Conn. 201, 206, 56 Atl. 498.</p>

<p class='c007'>The registration of the plaintiff’s machine was of no consequence
to the defendant. His failure to register and display his number in no
way contributed to cause the injury. The accident would have happened
if the law in this respect had been fully observed. The plaintiff’s
unlawful act was not the act of using the street, but in making a
lawful use of it without having his automobile registered and marked
as required by law. The statute contains no prohibition against using
an unlicensed and unnumbered automobile upon the highways and
streets of the State.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant placed much reliance upon the authority of Dudley <em>v.</em>
Northampton Street Ry. Co., 202 Mass. 443, 446, 89 N. E. 25. In
that case the Supreme Court of Massachusetts was called upon to
construe the effect of a statute which provided that no automobile
should be operated upon any public highway unless it was registered,
&amp;c. Dudley, the plaintiff in that action, was a resident of Connecticut.
He had fully complied with the laws of Connecticut, and had a
right to operate his machine on the highways of Massachusetts for a
period not exceeding fifteen days. After being in Massachusetts more
than fifteen days, Dudley’s automobile collided with the defendant’s
trolley-car. The Massachusetts court held that Dudley was a trespasser
against the rights of all persons lawfully controlling or using
the public highways of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difference between the Dudley case and the one now under consideration
is that in Massachusetts there was a statutory prohibition
against using upon the highways of that State an automobile unregistered
and unmarked. As already stated, no such provisions appeared
in the Connecticut statutes which were in force when the
plaintiff’s automobile was injured.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no error.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this opinion the other judges concurred.<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c015'><sup>[250]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'>NOYES <em>v.</em> COLBY<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New Hampshire, July Term, 1855.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 30 New Hampshire Reports, 143.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Trespass, for breaking and entering the plaintiff’s close in Franklin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plea, general issue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff proved that towards night, on June 27, the defendant’s
cow was upon his premises grazing, between his house and stable.
There was no fence between his land and the highway.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant then proposed to prove that, at that time he pastured
his cow in a pasture, on the road to Salisbury, and that one
Heath also pastured his cow in the same pasture. On the evening in
question, when Heath drove home his own cow, he also let the defendant’s
cow out of the pasture. He did this without the knowledge or
assent of the defendant, and without any authority, and had never
done so before, and after this transaction was requested by the defendant
not to do so again. He drove the cow down the road until
she came to the point where it connects with the road through the
village of Franklin, about two hundred feet from the plaintiff’s land,
when she strayed along the road and committed the trespass complained
of.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant contended that, under such circumstances he could
not be held to be a trespasser merely from the fact that he owned the
cow; that he had done no wrongful or improper act; that the act of
Heath, being without his knowledge or assent, and without his authority,
could not make him liable in trespass; that the action should not
have been brought against him, but if any trespass had been committed,
should have been brought against Heath.</p>

<p class='c007'>There being no dispute about the facts, the Court ruled that the
action could not be maintained; whereupon a verdict was taken for
the defendant, upon which judgment was to be rendered, or it was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>be set aside, and judgment rendered for the plaintiff for twenty-five
cents damages, as this Court might order.<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c015'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Woods, C. J.</span> “A man is answerable for not only his own trespass,
but that of his cattle also; for if by his negligent keeping they
stray upon the land of another (and much more if he permits or drives
them on), and they there tread down his neighbor’s herbage, and spoil
his corn or his trees, this is a trespass for which the owner must answer
in damages.” 3 Black. Com. 211. Such is the law as stated in the
words of the author of the Commentaries, which are themselves very
high authority on such subjects, and such has been the uniform practice
and understanding of the law in all times, so far as the books
show, and it is therefore too late to inquire whether the remedy by an
action of trespass is founded upon the strictest logical propriety, where
the cause of the damage is the negligence, and not the wilful act of
the owner of the mischievous beasts.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hardly necessary to remark, but for the course of the defendant’s
argument, that the proposition quoted from Blackstone relates
to the case in which the beasts “stray upon, the land of another,” and
not to the case in which they are driven upon it by a stranger; for
then the stranger is the author of the wrong, and the horse that he
rides, or drives, is the mere passive instrument in his hands, and the
owner of it, unless he have lent it for the purpose of the wrong, is as
wholly guiltless as any other person. For in that case, the beast
does not by the owner’s negligent keeping stray upon the land of his
neighbors.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is substantially upon this ground that Tewksbury <em>v.</em> Bucklin, 7
N. H. Rep. 518, was decided; in which it was held that a party having
the custody of the cattle was answerable for the trespass which they
committed by straying upon another’s inclosure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case finds that the cow “strayed along the road,” and committed
the act complained of. It would not be just to hold the party
to the strict meaning of a single word, if it appeared by the context
to have been used inaccurately; but it appears distinctly that the animal,
although driven by Heath some distance from the pasture in the
direction of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus in quo</span></i>, was not driven upon it so as to be in his
hands a mere instrument for committing a trespass. Heath’s trespass
was upon the chattel of the defendant, but not upon the soil of the
plaintiff. He abandoned the cow, and she being no longer in his custody,
“strayed,” and involved the owner in the consequences ordinarily
incident to permitting beasts to stray into the inclosures of
others.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Heath abandoned the cow, she was about twelve rods from
the lands of the plaintiff. From that period she was no longer under
the control of Heath, but was again in the legal possession of the
defendant, and under his general custody and control; and like other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>owners having the care and custody of their beasts at the time, he is
answerable in trespass for her act in straying upon the close in question,
and grazing there.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Court seem to have held that if the plaintiff’s oxen escaped
from his enclosure after the exercise of “ordinary care and prudence
in taking care of” them, he was not responsible for their trespass on
the defendants’ land. This view of the law, we think, cannot be sustained.
The plaintiff was bound at his peril to keep his cattle at home,
or at all events to keep them out of the defendants’ close, and no degree
of “care and prudence,” if the cattle found their way onto the
defendants’ land, would excuse the trespass. It would be a new feature
in the law of trespass, if the owner of cattle could escape responsibility
for their trespasses by showing he had used “ordinary,” or even
extraordinary “care and prudence” to keep them from doing mischief.<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c015'><sup>[253]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Appeal by special case from the decision of the judge of the
County Court of Lincolnshire, holden at Stamford.</p>

<p class='c007'>The action was to recover £1 for the damage done to goods in the
plaintiff’s shop.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>It appeared that on the 15th of May, 1882, an ox of the defendant
was being driven from the live-stock market in Broad Street, Stamford,
along a public street called Ironmonger Street, to the defendant’s
premises. Ironmonger Street has a paved carriage road with a foot
pavement on either side, and the plaintiff was the occupier of an
ironmonger’s shop in the street. The ox, after having gone for some
distance down the paved carriage road of Ironmonger Street, driven
by the defendant’s men, went for a short distance upon the foot pavement
on the near or left-hand side, and was driven therefrom by one
of the drovers in charge on to the carriage road, and after continuing
for a farther distance upon such carriage road, turned again on the
pavement about twelve yards from the plaintiff’s shop, and continued
upon the pavement until it came opposite the plaintiff’s shop, when it
passed through the open doorway into the shop and did damage to
goods therein to the amount claimed. The ox was, as soon as possible
after such entry and damage, driven by the defendant’s men from the
shop to the carriage road and to defendant’s premises in another
street; but they did not succeed in getting it out until about three-quarters
of an hour from the time when it entered. No special act of
negligence was proved on the part of the persons in charge of the ox,
and there was no evidence that it was of a vicious or unruly nature, or
that the defendant had any notice that there was anything exceptional
in its temper or character, or that it would be unsafe to drive it
through the public streets in the ordinary and usual way. It was
proved that at the time the ox left the carriage-way the second time,
one of the two men of the defendant in charge of the animal was
walking by its side, having his hand upon it, and that the other man
was walking about three yards in the rear of it. The two men in
charge proved that they drove it unaccompanied by other cattle from
the market, and they both declared that they did all they could under
the circumstances to prevent it going on to the foot pavement and
entering the open doorway of the plaintiff’s shop, and they stated
that the movement of the ox from the carriage-way on to the foot
pavement was sudden and could not by any reasonable or available
means have been prevented. It was alleged by the defendant’s witnesses,
and not contradicted, that it was a usual thing for several oxen
to be driven from the Stamford market in charge of two men, and
sometimes one man. It was admitted that it was not customary to
drive oxen with halters, and that they would probably not go quietly
if led by halters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The County Court judge gave a verdict for the amount claimed,
giving the defendant leave to appeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question for the opinion of the Court was, whether upon the
facts the plaintiff was entitled to the verdict.<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c015'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span><span class='sc'>Lord Coleridge, C. J.</span> In this action the County Court judge has
found as a fact that there was no negligence on the part of the drivers
of the ox, or, at all events, he has not found that there was negligence,
and as it lies on the plaintiff to make out his case, the charge of negligence,
so far as it has any bearing on the matter, must be taken to
have failed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, it is clear as a general rule that the owner of cattle and sheep
is bound to keep them from trespassing on his neighbor’s land, and if
they so trespass an action for damages may be brought against him,
irrespective of whether the trespass was or was not the result of his
negligence. It is also tolerably clear that where both parties are upon
the highway, where each of them has a right to be, and one of them is
injured by the trespass of an animal belonging to the other, he must,
in order to maintain his action, show that the trespass was owing to
the negligence of the other or of his servant. It is also clear that
where a man is injured by a fierce or vicious animal belonging to
another, that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> no action can be brought without proof that
the owner of the animal knew of its mischievous tendencies.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present case the trespass, if there was any, was committed
off the highway upon the plaintiff’s close, which immediately adjoined
the highway, by an animal belonging to the defendant which was
being driven on the highway. No negligence is proved, and it would
seem to follow from the law that I have previously stated that the
defendant is not responsible. We find it established as an exception
upon the general law of trespass, that where cattle trespass upon
unfenced land immediately adjoining a highway the owner of the land
must bear the loss. This is shown by the judgment of Bramwell, B.,
in Goodwyn <em>v.</em> Cheveley, 28 L. J. (Ex.) 298. That learned judge
goes into the question whether a reasonable time had or had not
elapsed for the removal of cattle who had trespassed under similar
circumstances, and this question would not have arisen if a mere
momentary trespass had been by itself actionable. There is also the
statement of Blackburn, J., in Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands, L. R. 1 Ex. 265,
that persons who have property adjacent to a highway may be taken
to hold it subject to the risk of injury from inevitable risk. I could
not, therefore, if I were disposed, question law laid down by such
eminent authorities, but I quite concur in their view, and I see no distinction
for this purpose between a field in the country and a street in
a market town. The accident to the plaintiff was one of the necessary
and inevitable risks which arise from driving cattle in the streets in or
out of town. No cause of action is shown, and the judgment of the
County Court judge must be reversed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Stephen, J.</span> I am of the same opinion. As I understand the law,
when a man has placed his cattle in a field it is his duty to keep them
from trespassing on the land of his neighbors, but while he is driving
them upon a highway he is not responsible, without proof of negligence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>on his part, for any injury they may do upon the highway, for
they cannot then be said to be trespassing. The case of Goodwyn <em>v.</em>
Cheveley, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, seems to me to establish a further exception, that the
owner of the cattle is not responsible without negligence when the
injury is done to property adjoining the highway,—an exception
which is absolutely necessary for the conduct of the common affairs of
life. We have been invited to limit this exception to the case of high
roads adjoining fields in the country, but I am very unwilling to
multiply exceptions, and I can see no solid distinction between the
case of an animal straying into a field which is unfenced or into an
open shop in a town. I think the rule to be gathered from Goodwyn
<em>v.</em> Cheveley, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, a very reasonable one, for otherwise I cannot see
how we could limit the liability of the owner of the cattle for any sort
of injury which could be traced to them.</p>

<h5 class='c013'><span class='sc'>COOLEY ON TORTS, 2d ed., 398–400.</span></h5>
<p class='c022'>The statutes which, under some circumstances, or for some purposes, require
lands to be fenced by their owners, are so various in the several States
that it is not easy even to classify them. Some of them provide merely that
unless the owner shall cause his lands to be fenced with such a fence as is
particularly described, he shall maintain no action for the trespasses of beasts
upon them. These statutes are generally limited in their force to exterior
fences, and are intended as a part of a system under which cattle are or may
be allowed to depasture the highway. In some States, from the earliest days,
beasts have been allowed to roam at large in the highways and unenclosed
lands, either by general law or on a vote of the township or county to that
effect; a futile permission, if owners of lands are not required to fence against
them. A more common provision is one requiring the owners of adjoining
premises to keep up, respectively, one-half the partition fence between them,
this being apportioned for the purpose by agreement, by prescription, or by
the order of fence-viewers. A neglect of duty under these statutes would not
only preclude the party in fault from maintaining suit for injuries suffered by
himself in consequence thereof, but it would seem that if the domestic animals
of his neighbor should wander upon his lands, invited by his own neglect, and
should there fall into pits, or otherwise receive injury, he would be responsible
for this injury, as one occurring proximately from his own default. The statutes
which require the construction of partition fences do so for the benefit
exclusively of the adjoining proprietors. These proprietors may, at their option,
by agreement, dispense with them, and even if they do not agree to do so,
but fail to maintain them as the law contemplates, still, if the cattle of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>third persons come wrongfully upon one man’s lands, and from there enter the
adjoining enclosure, it is no answer to an action of trespass brought by
the owner of the latter that the partition fence provided for by the law was not
maintained.<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c015'><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'>WAGNER <em>v.</em> BISSELL<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Iowa, December Term, 1856.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 3 Iowa Reports, 396.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Appeal from the Jones District Court.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was an action of replevin for certain cattle. Defendant
answered, denying the plaintiff’s right to the possession, and also
alleging as a special ground of defence, that said cattle (which he
admits to be the property of plaintiff) did on the 17th day of August,
1856, trespass upon the uninclosed land of defendant, and while so
trespassing, and after he had suffered damage to the amount of fifty
dollars, he, said defendant, distrained the same, as he had a right to
do; and while thus lawfully distrained, and while he thus rightfully
had the possession, the said plaintiff replevied the said cattle, without
paying, or offering to pay, for the damages sustained. To this answer
the plaintiff demurred, which was sustained. Defendant refused to
answer over, and judgment being against him, he appeals.<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c015'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Wright, C. J.</span> [After deciding a point of pleading.] There is then
but one question in the case, and that is, whether the defendant, for
the reasons stated in his answer, was entitled to the possession of the
property, as against the plaintiff and owner. We are of opinion that
he was not, and that the demurrer was therefore properly sustained.</p>

<p class='c007'>That at common law, every man was bound to keep his cattle within
his own close, under the penalty of answering in damage for all injuries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>arising from their being abroad, is admitted by all. And a part
of the same rule is, that the owner of land is not bound to protect
his premises from the intrusion of the cattle of a stranger, or third
person; and that if such cattle shall intrude or trespass upon his
premises, whether inclosed or not, he may, at his election, bring his
action to recover the damages sustained, or distrain such trespassing
animals, until compensated for such injury. We need not at present
stop to ascertain the origin or reason of this rule. It is sufficient to
say, that as a principle of the common law, it is well, and we believe
universally settled. We are then led to inquire, whether, independent
of any statutory provisions, this rule is applicable to our condition
and circumstances as a people; and if it is, then whether it has or has
not, been changed by legislative action.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unlike many of the States, we have no statute declaring in express
terms the common law to be in force in this State. That it is, however,
has been frequently decided by this Court, and does not, perhaps,
admit of controversy. But while this is true, it must be understood
that it is adopted only so far as it is <em>applicable</em> to us as a people,
and may be of a general nature. At this time we need only discuss
the question whether the principle contended for is applicable;
for there can be no fair ground for claiming that it is not of a general
nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have assumed that it is only so much of the common law as is
<em>applicable</em> that can be said to be in force, or recognized as a rule of
action in this State. To say that every principle of that law, however
inapplicable to our wants or institutions, is to continue in force, until
changed by some legislative rule, we believe has never been claimed,
neither indeed could it be, with any degree of reason. What is meant
however, by the term “applicable,” has been thought to admit of
some controversy. As stated by Catron, J., in the dissenting opinion
in the case of Seely <em>v.</em> Peters, 5 Gilm. 130, “Does it mean applicable to
the nature of our political institutions, and to the genius of our republican
form of government, and to our Constitution, or to our domestic
habits, our wants, and our necessities?” He then maintains that
the former only is meant, and that to adopt the latter is a clear usurpation
of legislative power by the courts. A majority of the Court held
in that case, however, as had been previously decided in Boyer <em>v.</em>
Sweet, 3 Scam. 121, “that in adopting the common law, it must be
applicable to the habits and condition of our society, and in harmony
with the genius, spirit, and objects of our institutions.” And we can
see no just or fair objection to this view of the subject. Indeed, there
would seem to be much propriety in saying that the distinction attempted
is more speculative than practical or real. For what is
applicable to our wants, habits, and necessities as a community or
state, must necessarily to some extent be determined from the nature
and genius of our government and institutions. Or, in other words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>to determine whether a particular principle harmonizes with the spirit
of our institutions, we must look to the habits and condition of the
society which has created and lived under these institutions. We have
adopted a republican form of government, because we believe it to be
better suited to our condition, as it is to that of all people,—and
thereunder we believe our wants, rights, and necessities, as individuals
and as a community, are more likely to be protected and provided for.
And the conclusion would seem to fairly follow, that a principle or
rule which tends to provide for, and protect our rights and wants,
would harmonize with that form of government or those institutions
which have grown up under it.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, however this may be, we do not believe that in determining as
a Court, whether a particular rule of the unwritten law is applicable,
we are confined alone to its agreement or disagreement with our peculiar
form of government. To make the true distinction between the
rules which are, and are not, applicable, may be frequently embarrassing
and difficult to courts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the common law has been repealed or changed by the constitutions
of either the States or national government, or by their legislative
enactments, it is, of course, not binding. So also, it is safe to
say, that where it has been varied by custom, not founded in reason,
or not consonant to the genius and manners of the people, it ceases
to have force. Bouvier’s Law Dict., title Law, Common. And in
accordance with this position, are the following authorities: “The
common law of England is not to be taken in all respects to be that of
America. Our ancestors brought with them its general principles, and
claimed it as their birthright; but they brought with them and
adopted only that portion which was applicable to their situation.”
Van Ness <em>v.</em> Packard, 2 Peters, 137. And see other remarks of the
learned judge, in delivering the opinion in that case, page 143, which
have a bearing upon the principal question involved in this.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Goring <em>v.</em> Emery, 16 Pick. 107, in speaking of what parts of the
common law and the statutes of England are to be taken as in force
in Massachusetts, Shaw, C. J., says: “That what are to be deemed
in force is often a question of difficulty, depending upon the nature
of the subject, the difference between the character of our institutions,
and our general course of policy, and those of the parent country, and
upon fitness and usage.” And in The Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Knowlton,
2 Mass. 534, it is said that “our ancestors, when they came into this
new world, claimed the common law as their birthright, and brought
it with them, except such parts as were adjudged inapplicable to their
new state and condition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Ohio the rule is laid down as follows: “It has been repeatedly
decided by the courts of this State that they will adopt the principles
of the common law, as the rule of decision, so far only as those principles
are adapted to our circumstances, state of society, and form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>of government.” Lindsley <em>v.</em> Coats, 1 Ham. 243; see also Penny <em>v.</em>
Little, 3 Scam. 301.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is the rule of the common law, relied upon by the appellant in this
case, applicable to our situation, condition, and usage, as a people?
Is it in accordance with our habits, wants, and necessities? As
applied to this State, is it founded in reason and the fitness of things?
The legislature has certainly not so regarded it. On the contrary, we
hope to be able to show that what legislation we have clearly recognizes
the opposite rule. At present, we are considering the question
without reference to any legislative interpretation or action.</p>

<p class='c007'>These same inquiries were substantially discussed in the case of
Seely <em>v.</em> Peters, above referred to; and as we could not hope to answer
them more satisfactorily than is there done, we adopt the language
used in that case, the appropriateness of which, as applied to this
State, will be fully appreciated when we reflect that in their resources
and necessities, Illinois and Iowa are almost twin sisters. Both alike
are agricultural States—both alike have large and extensive prairies—and
are alike destitute of timber, as compared with the eastern and
older States of the Union.</p>

<p class='c007'>Says Trumbull, J., in delivering that opinion: “However well
adapted the rule of the common law may be to a densely populated
country like England, it is surely but ill-adapted to a new country
like ours. If this common-law rule prevails now, it must have prevailed
from the time of the earliest settlement of the State, and can
it be supposed that when the early settlers of this country located
upon the borders of our extensive prairies, that they brought with
them, and adopted as applicable to their condition, a rule of law requiring
each one to fence up his cattle? that they designed the millions
of fertile acres stretched out before them, to go ungrazed, except
as each purchaser from the government was able to inclose his part
with a fence? This State is unlike any of the eastern States in their
early settlement, because, from the scarcity of timber, it must be
many years yet before our extensive prairies can be fenced; and their
luxuriant growth, sufficient for thousands of cattle, must be suffered to
rot and decay where it grows, unless settlers upon their borders are permitted
to turn their cattle upon them. Perhaps there is no principle
of the common law so inapplicable to the condition of our country and
the people as the one which is sought to be enforced now, for the first
time, since the settlement of the State. It has been the custom of Illinois,
so long that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, for
the owners of stock to suffer them to run at large. Settlers have
located themselves contiguous to prairies, for the very purpose of getting
the benefit of the range. The right of all to pasture their cattle
upon uninclosed ground is universally conceded. No man has questioned
this right, although hundreds of cases must have occurred
where the owners of cattle have escaped the payment of damages on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>account of the insufficiency of the fences through which their stock
have broken; and never till now has the common-law rule that the
owner of cattle is bound to fence them up been suffered to prevail, or
to be applicable to our condition. The universal understanding of all
classes of community, upon which they have acted by inclosing their
crops and letting their cattle run at large, is entitled to no little consideration
in determining what the law is; and we should feel inclined
to hold, independent of any statutes upon the subject, on account of
the inapplicability of the common-law rule to the condition and circumstances
of our people, that it does not, and never has, prevailed
in Illinois.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned judge then proceeds to show that it is not necessary to
assume that ground in the case before him, for the reason, as he says,
that their entire legislation clearly shows that this rule of the common
law never prevailed in that State. In like manner, we now propose to
refer to some of our own legislation which, we think, will clearly show
that it was never supposed to prevail in this State. [Here <span class='sc'>Wright,
C. J.</span>, stated, and commented upon, various statutes.]</p>

<p class='c007'>This brief reference to these several acts must be sufficient, in our
opinion, to satisfy any mind that the legislature never understood that
the rule of the common law prevailed in this State. We do not maintain
that these provisions expressly change the common-law rule. And
did we believe that this principle had, at any time, been well established
in this State, we should perhaps hold that it had not been
changed by these different statutes. Where, however, it is, to say the
least, doubtful whether the rule contended for is in accordance with
our situation, condition, and wants as a people, where for a series of
years there has been no legislation recognizing the existence of such a
rule, and where custom and habit have uniformly negatived its existence,
we feel entirely justified in giving force to these acts which, if
they do not expressly, certainly do impliedly, change the unwritten
law.</p>

  <h5 class='c013'>BEINHORN <em>v.</em> GRISWOLD<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Montana, July 14, 1902.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 27 Montana Reports, 79.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Pigott, J.</span><a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c015'><sup>[259]</sup></a> Action to recover damages for injuries alleged to have
been caused by the negligence of the defendant. The complaint states
that the defendant negligently left exposed a vat containing poisonous
liquid; that by reason of such negligence certain cattle of plaintiff
and of one Holm drank from the vat some of the liquid, and died from
the effects of the poison; and that Holm assigned his demand for
damages to the plaintiff. The answer puts in issue the allegation of
negligence, and avers that the death of the cattle was caused by the
carelessness of the plaintiff and Holm. The plaintiff secured a judgment,
and the defendant moved for a new trial on several grounds, one
being the insufficiency of the evidence to prove negligence on the part
of the defendant. From the order denying a new trial the defendant
has appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts upon which the plaintiff bases his allegations of negligence
are substantially these: During the year 1898 the defendant
was the lessee in possession of the Non-Such gold mine and mill site.
The property was not inclosed by a legal fence. For the proper conduct
of his mining operations he employed the cyanide process, using
large quantities of poisonous chemicals, consisting principally of cyanide
of potassium, which he diluted with water, and kept in suitable
receptacles on the surface of the mining property, but not sufficiently
covered to prevent easy access to the poisonous solution. In appearance
it resembled water. Cattle of the plaintiff and of Holm, while
ranging on the public domain, wandered over to and upon the defendant’s
mine and mill site, and there drank the poisonous liquid contained
in the vats or tubs. The defendant knew that the cattle were
in the habit of straying upon his uninclosed property, and he had
driven them away whenever he saw them there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff insists there is but one question involved, which he
states thus: Is a “landowner who negligently leaves exposed upon his
uninclosed premises, where he knows stock are wont to stray, dangerous
places or substances, whereby another’s cattle, straying thereon,
are injured, liable for such injury?” He argues that, as the defendant’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>mining property was not inclosed by a legal fence, the cattle
were not trespassing upon his property, but were rightfully thereon,
and that therefore he owed to the plaintiff the duty so to use his property
and conduct his business as not to injure the plaintiff’s cattle;
that, in failing to cover the poisonous solution so as to prevent the
cattle from drinking of it, he violated this alleged duty, and as such
negligence resulted in the death of the cattle, and consequent loss to
the plaintiff, the defendant is liable in damages. In support of his
contention the plaintiff cites Monroe <em>v.</em> Cannon, 24 Montana Reports,
316 (61 Pac. 863, 81 Am. St. Rep. 439), where the owner of pasture
land was held entitled to recover the value of grass consumed by bands
of sheep deliberately and intentionally driven on it by the herder in
charge of them; the opinion containing the following language: “If
in the case now under consideration the damage sustained by respondent
had resulted from trespasses committed by cattle or sheep or other
animals named in the statute, lawfully at large, and not under the
direction and control of their owner, then appellant’s position would
be sound.” Neither this language, nor anything said in the opinion,
lends countenance to the contention of the plaintiff in the case at bar.
The decision does not declare or define any duty owing by the landowner
to the owner of straying cattle. These observations apply also
to Section 3258 of the Political Code, which reads: “If any cattle,
horse, mule, ass, hog, sheep, or other domestic animal break into any
inclosure, the fence being legal, as hereinbefore provided, the owner
of such animal is liable for all damages to the owner or occupant of
the inclosure which may be sustained thereby. This section must not
be construed so as to require a legal fence in order to maintain an
action for injury done by animals running at large contrary to law.”
Even if it be conceded that the cattle of the plaintiff were not wrongfully
upon defendant’s property, no liability would be incurred from
the fact that they were injured while there, unless it was the defendant’s
duty to protect from injury all cattle on his property whose
trespass was not of such a nature as to render their owners liable for
the trespass. Counsel for the plaintiff urge that, if these cattle were
not wrongfully on the defendant’s property, they must have been
rightfully there; asserting that if there was no remedy by action, there
could not be a trespass. To this we cannot yield assent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The owner is entitled to the exclusive possession of his land,
whether fenced or not; and it is beyond the power of the legislature
to prescribe, or of custom to create, a right in another to occupy the
land or enjoy its fruits. Either written law or custom may withhold
from the owner who does not fence his land a remedy for loss suffered
by reason of casual trespasses by cattle which stray upon it, and
may give a remedy for such trespasses to those only who inclose their
land. By custom as well as by statute the common law of England
has been so modified in Montana. This is undoubtedly a legitimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>exercise of the police power. It falls far short, however, of conferring
a legal right to dispossess the nonfencing owner. He may at pleasure
lawfully drive the intruding cattle from his land, and keep them away
from it. This is his right, for the cattle are trespassing. The owners
of domestic animals hold no servitude upon or interest, temporary or
permanent, in the open land of another, merely because it is open. If
the landowner fails to “fence out” cattle lawfully at large, he may
not successfully complain of loss caused by such live stock straying
upon his uninclosed land. For under these circumstances the trespass
is condoned or excused,—the law refuses to award damages. While
the landowner, by omitting to fence, disables himself from invoking
the remedy which is given to those who inclose their property with a
legal fence, and while the cattle owner is thereby relieved from liability
for casual trespasses, it is nevertheless true that the cattle owner
has no <em>right</em> to pasture his cattle on the land of another, and that
cattle thus wandering over such lands are not rightfully there. They
are there merely by the forbearance, sufferance, or tolerance of the
nonfencing landowner; there they may remain only by his tolerance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cattle-owning plaintiff did not owe to the land-owning defendant
the duty to fence his cattle in; the latter did not owe to the former
the duty to fence them out; neither of them was under obligation to
the other in that regard. The defendant is not liable in this action
unless he was negligent. There cannot be negligence without breach
of duty. Hence, manifestly, the defendant was not guilty of negligence
in omitting to prevent the plaintiff’s cattle from going upon his
unfenced land.</p>

<p class='c007'>As has just been said, the straying of the plaintiff’s cattle upon the
defendant’s land did not involve the violation of any legal duty upon
the part of the defendant. There would therefore seem to be no basis
for the plaintiff’s charge of negligence on the part of the defendant,
unless it consists in the defendant’s alleged failure to protect the
cattle from injury while on his land. The damage resulted from a
permissive, not an active, cause of injury. We are asked to hold
that the law imposed upon the defendant, in addition to the duty of
refraining from intentional or wanton injury to the cattle, the duty so
to use his property and so to conduct his mining operations thereon
as to avoid all dangers to which these trespassing beasts might expose
themselves. Counsel invoke the provisions of Section 2296 of the
Civil Code, which is declaratory of the common law: “Every one is
responsible&#160;... for an injury occasioned to another by his want of
ordinary care or skill in the management of his property....” Giving
to the principle thus expressed full recognition, and measuring the
rights of the parties by the test of negligence thus furnished, we are
unable to find in the record evidence of acts or omissions by the
defendant constituting negligence in the management of his property.
But the plaintiff contends that, irrespective of Section 2296, the defendant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>has been guilty of negligence in so using his property as to
imperil, and in this case actually injure, the property of another. We
think the principles which he invokes have no application to the facts
disclosed by the record. To a naked trespasser or mere licensee by
sufferance (if the expression may correctly be used) the landowner
owes the duty to refrain from any wilful or wanton act causing injury
to his person or chattels, and, after discovering that the trespasser is
in imminent danger or immediate peril, to use reasonable care to avoid
an active cause of injury. Egan <em>v.</em> Montana Central Railway Co., 24
Montana Reports, 569, 63 Pac. 831. The rule is different in respect
of those who go upon property because of the owner’s invitation,
either express or implied. As to such persons he is bound, at his
peril, to use reasonable care and diligence in keeping his property in
safe condition. To a mere licensee or naked trespasser the landowner
does not owe the active duty of being diligent or using care in providing
against the danger of accident. The distinction is well expressed
in Sweeny <em>v.</em> Old Colony &amp; Newport Railroad Co., 10 Allen,
368, 87 Am. Dec. 644:</p>

<p class='c007'>[A long quotation from the opinion in that case is omitted.]</p>

<p class='c007'>The methods pursued by the defendant in the management and use
of his property involved no danger to the plaintiff or his cattle, nor
exposed either to risk, so long as he and they remained within the
limits of the plaintiff’s rights. The contention of the plaintiff rests
upon the erroneous theory, heretofore considered, that the cattle owners
hold a personal servitude upon, or the right of commons or profit
in, all unfenced land, by virtue of which they are supposed to be entitled,
as of right, to use for grazing and pasture all of the uninclosed
lands of other persons. Such burden upon or easement in gross in
open lands has not been granted, and does not exist. We have already
decided that such use, while it does not constitute an actionable
wrong, is not the exercise of a legal right; and as the cattle owner possessed
no right to have his live stock upon the defendant’s land, and
the latter was clothed with the unquestioned right to drive them
away because they were not rightfully there, clearly the defendant had
no active duty in respect of them while there. He was, of course,
bound to refrain from intentional or wanton injury; if he stood by
and knowingly permitted them to drink of the poisonous solution,
without making an effort to prevent them from doing so, he might,
perhaps, be liable; but neither of these conditions is in the case
at bar.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think there is no proof in the record which justifies the application
of the doctrine of invitation, enticement, allurement or attraction.

<h5 class='c013'>MAY <em>v.</em> BURDETT<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Queen’s Bench, June 2, 1846.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 9 Queen’s Bench Reports</em> (<em>Adolphus &amp; Ellis</em>, <span class='fss'>N. S.</span>), 101.</h5>

<p class='c014'>Case. The declaration stated that defendant, “before and at the
time of the damage and injury hereinafter mentioned to the said
Sophia, the wife of the said Stephen May, wrongfully, and injuriously
kept a certain monkey, he the defendant well knowing that the said
monkey was of a mischievous and ferocious nature, and was used and
accustomed to attack and bite mankind, and that it was dangerous
and improper to allow the monkey to be at large and unconfined;
which said monkey, whilst the said defendant kept the same as aforesaid,
heretofore and before the commencement of this suit, to wit, on
the 2d of September, 1844, did attack, bite, wound, lacerate, and injure
the said Sophia, then and still being the wife of said Stephen
May, whereby the said Sophia became and was greatly terrified and
alarmed, and became and was sick, sore, lame, and disordered, and so
remained and continued for a long time, to wit, from the day and year
last aforesaid to the time of the commencement of this suit; whereby,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>and in consequence of the alarm and fright occasioned by the said
monkey so attacking, biting, wounding, lacerating, and injuring her as
aforesaid, the said Sophia has been greatly injured in her health,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plea, not guilty. Issue thereon.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the trial, before Wightman, J., at the sittings in Middlesex,
after Hilary term, 1845, a verdict was found for the plaintiff with £50
damages. Cockburn, in the ensuing term, obtained a rule to show
cause why judgment should not be arrested.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The cause was argued] before <span class='sc'>Lord Denman, C. J.</span>, <span class='sc'>Patteson, J.</span>,
<span class='sc'>Coleridge, J.</span>, and <span class='sc'>Wightman, J.</span><a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c015'><sup>[261]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Denman, C. J.</span>, now delivered the judgment of the Court.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was a motion to arrest the judgment in an action on the case
for keeping a monkey which the defendant knew to be accustomed to
bite people, and which bit the female plaintiff. The declaration stated
that the defendant wrongfully kept a monkey, well knowing that
it was of a mischievous and ferocious nature and used and accustomed
to attack and bite mankind, and that it was dangerous to allow it
to be at large; and that the monkey, whilst the defendant kept the
same as aforesaid, did attack, bite, and injure the female plaintiff,
whereby, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was objected on the part of the defendant that the declaration
was bad for not alleging negligence or some default of the defendant in
not properly or securely keeping the animal; and it was said that,
consistently with this declaration, the monkey might have been kept
with due and proper caution, and that the injury might have been
entirely occasioned by the carelessness and want of caution of the
plaintiff herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great many cases and precedents were cited upon the argument;
and the conclusion to be drawn from them appears to us to be that the
declaration is good upon the face of it; and that whoever keeps an
animal accustomed to attack and bite mankind, with knowledge that
it is so accustomed, is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> liable in an action on the case at the
suit of any person attacked and injured by the animal, without any
averment of negligence or default in the securing or taking care of it.
The gist of the action is the keeping the animal after knowledge of its
mischievous propensities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The precedents, both ancient and modern, with scarcely an exception,
merely state the ferocity of the animal and the knowledge of the
defendant, without any allegation of negligence or want of care. A
great many were referred to upon the argument, commencing with the
Register and ending with Thomas <em>v.</em> Morgan, 2 C. M. &amp; R. 496; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span>
5 Tyr. 1085; and all in the same form, or nearly so. In the Register,
110, 111, two precedents of writs are given, one for keeping a dog
accustomed to bite sheep, and the other for keeping a boar accustomed
to attack and wound other animals. The cause of action, as stated in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>both these precedents, is the propensity of the animals, the knowledge
of the defendant, and the injury to the plaintiff; but there is no allegation
of negligence or want of care. In the case of Mason <em>v.</em> Kneeling,
reported in 1 Ld. Ray. and 12 Mod., and much relied upon on the
part of the defendant, want of due care was alleged, but the scienter
was omitted; and the question was, not whether the declaration would
be good without the allegation of want of care, but whether it was good
without the allegation of knowledge, which it was held that it was not.
No case was cited in which it had been decided that a declaration stating
the ferocity of the animal and the knowledge of the defendant was
bad for not averring negligence also; but various <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</span></i> in the books
were cited to show that this is an action founded on negligence, and
therefore not maintainable unless some negligence or want of care is
alleged.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Comyns’ Digest, tit. Action upon the Case for Negligence (A 5),
it is said that “an action upon the case lies for a neglect in taking care
of his cattle, dog, &amp;c.;” and passages were cited from the older authorities,
and also from some cases at <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi prius</span></i>, in which expressions
were used showing that, if persons suffered animals to go at large,
knowing them to be disposed to do mischief, they were liable in case
any mischief actually was done; and it was attempted to be inferred
from this that the liability only attached in case they were suffered to
go at large or to be otherwise ill secured. But the conclusion to be
drawn from an examination of all the authorities appears to us to be
this: that a person keeping a mischievous animal with knowledge of
its propensities is bound to keep it secure at his peril, and that if it
does mischief, negligence is presumed, without express averment. The
precedents as well as the authorities fully warrant this conclusion.
The negligence is in keeping such an animal after notice. The case of
Smith <em>v.</em> Pelah, 2 Stra. 1264, and a passage in 1 Hale’s Pleas of the
Crown, 430,<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c015'><sup>[262]</sup></a> put the liability on the true ground. It may be that if
the injury was solely occasioned by the wilfulness of the plaintiff after
warning, that may be a ground of defence, by plea in confession and
avoidance; but it is unnecessary to give any opinion as to this; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>we think that the declaration is good upon the face of it, and shows a
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> liability in the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was said, indeed, further, on the part of the defendant, that, the
monkey being an animal <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferae naturae</span></i>, he would not be answerable for
injuries committed by it if it escaped and went at large without any
default on the part of the defendant, during the time it had so escaped
and was at large, because at that time it would not be in his keeping
nor under his control; but we cannot allow any weight to this objection;
for, in the first place, there is no statement in the declaration
that the monkey had escaped, and it is expressly averred that the
injury occurred whilst the defendant kept it; we are besides of
opinion, as already stated, that the defendant, if he would keep it, was
bound to keep it secure at all events.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rule therefore will be discharged.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>FILBURN <em>v.</em> PEOPLE’S PALACE AND AQUARIUM COMPANY, LIMITED<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Court of Appeal, June 30, 1890.</span><br /> <em>Reported in Law Reports, 25 Queen’s Bench Division, 258.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Appeal from a judgment of <span class='sc'>Day, J.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>The action was brought to recover damages for injuries sustained by
the plaintiff by his being attacked by an elephant, which was the property
of the defendants, and was being exhibited by them. The learned
judge left three questions to the jury: whether the elephant was an
animal dangerous to man; whether the defendant knew the elephant
to be dangerous, and whether the plaintiff brought the attack on himself.
The jury answered all three questions in the negative. The
learned judge entered judgment for the plaintiff for a sum agreed
upon in case the plaintiff should be entitled to recover.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Lockwood</em>, Q. C., and <em>Cyril Dodd</em>, Q. C., in support of the appeal.
There are certain animals recognized as being of an untamable
nature, and these a person keeps at his peril. In Hale’s Pleas of the
Crown (vol. i, p. 430), it is said: “Tho’ he have no particular notice
that he did any such thing before, yet if it be a beast, that is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferae
naturae</span></i>, as a lion, a bear, a wolf, yea an ape or a monkey, if he get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>loose and do harm to any person, the owner is liable to an action for
the damage.” There is, however, no hard and fast line which prevents
an animal <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferae naturae</span></i> ceasing to belong to that class and becoming
domesticated. The distinction is drawn in Rex <em>v.</em> Huggins, 2 Ld.
Raym. 1574, where it is said: “There is a difference between beasts
that are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferae naturae</span></i>, as lions and tygers, which a man must always
keep up at his peril; and beasts that are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mansuetae naturae</span></i>, and break
through the tameness of their nature, such as oxen and horses. In the
latter case an action lies, if the owner has had notice of the quality of
the beast; in the former case an action lies without such notice.” All
animals are wild by nature, and the reason for the distinction is, that
some of them are treated as domesticated, because they have been
tamed and are used in the service of man. Though there are wild
elephants, just as there are wild oxen and horses, a great number have
been tamed, and are used in the service of man; and the same ruling
should apply to individuals of this class as to domesticated animals
generally. The jury have negatived any knowledge on the part of the
defendants of any dangerous character in this elephant, and they are,
under these circumstances, entitled to the verdict.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Esher, M. R.</span> The only difficulty I feel in the decision of this
case is whether it is possible to enunciate any formula under which
this and similar cases may be classified. The law of England recognizes
two distinct classes of animals; and as to one of those classes, it
cannot be doubted that a person who keeps an animal belonging to
that class must prevent it from doing injury, and it is immaterial
whether he knows it to be dangerous or not. As to another class, the
law assumes that animals belonging to it are not of a dangerous
nature, and any one who keeps an animal of this kind is not liable for
the damage it may do, unless he knew that it was dangerous. What,
then, is the best way of dealing generally with these different cases?
I suppose there can be no dispute that there are some animals that
every one must recognize as not being dangerous on account of their
nature. Whether they are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferae naturae</span></i> so far as rights of property are
concerned is not the question; they certainly are not so in the sense
that they are dangerous. There is another set of animals that the law
has recognized in England as not being of a dangerous nature, such as
sheep, horses, oxen, dogs, and others that I will not attempt to enumerate.
I take it this recognition has come about from the fact that
years ago, and continuously to the present time, the progeny of these
classes has been found by experience to be harmless, and so the law
assumes the result of this experience to be correct without further
proof. Unless an animal is brought within one of these two descriptions,—that
is, unless it is shown to be either harmless by its very
nature, or to belong to a class that has become so by what may be
called cultivation,—it falls within the class of animals as to which
the rule is, that a man who keeps one must take the responsibility of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>keeping it safe. It cannot possibly be said that an elephant comes
within the class of animals known to be harmless by nature, or within
that shown by experience to be harmless in this country, and consequently
it falls within the class of animals that a man keeps at his
peril, and which he must prevent from doing injury under any circumstances,
unless the person to whom the injury is done brings it on
himself. It was, therefore, immaterial in this case whether the particular
animal was a dangerous one, or whether the defendants had
any knowledge that it was so. The judgment entered was in these
circumstances right, and the appeal must be dismissed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lindley, L. J.</span> I am of the same opinion. The last case of this
kind discussed was May <em>v.</em> Burdett, 9 Q. B. 101, but there the monkey
which did the mischief was said to be accustomed to attack mankind,
to the knowledge of the person who kept it. That does not decide this
case. We have had no case cited to us, nor any evidence, to show
that elephants in this country are not as a class dangerous; nor are
they commonly known here to belong to the class of domesticated animals.
Therefore a person who keeps one is liable, though he does not
know that the particular one that he keeps is mischievous. Applying
that principle to this case, it appears that the judgment for the plaintiff
was right, and this appeal must be dismissed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bowen, L. J.</span> I am of the same opinion. The broad principle that
governs this case is that laid down in Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands, Law Rep.
1 Ex. 265; Law Rep. 3 H. L. 330, that a person who brings upon his
land anything that would not naturally come upon it, and which is in
itself dangerous, must take care that it is kept under proper control.
The question of liability for damage done by mischievous animals is a
branch of that law which has been applied in the same way from the
times of Lord Holt<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c015'><sup>[264]</sup></a> and of Hale until now. People must not be wiser
than the experience of mankind. If from the experience of mankind a
particular class of animals is dangerous, though individuals may be
tamed, a person who keeps one of the class takes the risk of any damage
it may do. If, on the other hand, the animal kept belongs to a
class which, according to the experience of mankind, is not dangerous,
and not likely to do mischief, and if the class is dealt with by mankind
on that footing, a person may safely keep such an animal, unless he
knows that the particular animal that he keeps is likely to do mischief.
It cannot be doubted that elephants as a class have not been reduced
to a state of subjection; they still remain wild and untamed, though
individuals are brought to a degree of tameness which amounts to
domestication. A person, therefore, who keeps an elephant, does so at
his own risk, and an action can be maintained for any injury done by
it, although the owner had no knowledge of its mischievous propensities.
I agree, therefore, that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>

  <h5 class='c013'>MAUNG KYAW DUN <em>v.</em> MA KYIN<br /> <span class='sc'>Before the Judicial Commissioner of Upper Burma, May 7, 1900.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 2 Upper Burma Rulings (1897–1901), Civil, 570.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>H. Thirkell White, Esq., Judicial Commissioner.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff-appellant sued to recover damages on account of the
death of his elephant “Do,” which died from the effect of wounds inflicted
by the respondents’ elephant, “Kya Gyi.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The issues which arise in a case of this kind have been stated in two
cases of this court. In Maung Gyi <em>v.</em> Po To [same vol., p. 565] it
was observed that the issue generally would no doubt be the usual
issue as to the existence of negligence on the part of the owner of the
animal doing the damage. In Maung Saw <em>v.</em> Maung Kyaw [same vol.,
p. 567], points which arise in a case very similar to the present were
indicated. There has been some argument in this court on the application
of the doctrine of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i>. It is said that “any one who keeps
a wild animal, as a tiger or bear, which escapes and does damage, is
liable without any proof of notice of the animal’s ferocity; but where
the damage is done by a domestic animal, the plaintiff must show that
the defendant knew the animal was accustomed to do mischief.”
Collett on Torts, 7th edition, p. 100. Again, “a person keeping a
mischievous animal with knowledge of its propensities is bound to
keep it secure at his peril. If it escapes and does mischief, he is liable
without proof of negligence, neither is proof required that he knew the
animal to be mischievous, if it is of a notoriously fierce or mischievous
species.” Pollock on Torts, 3d edition, p. 442. In Smith’s Leading
Cases in the notes on Fletcher v. Rylands, 10th edition, vol. i, p. 827,
it is said: “The law of England recognizes two distinct classes of
animals. The first class consists of such animals as sheep, horses,
oxen, and dogs, which the law assumes not to be of a dangerous nature,
and a person who keeps an animal of this class is not liable for any
damage it may do, when not trespassing, unless he knew that it was in
fact dangerous. The other class consists of animals which have not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>been shown by experience to be harmless by nature; and one who
keeps animals of this class must prevent them from doing injury
under any circumstances, unless the person to whom it is done brings
it on himself.” In the English case on which these remarks are based
(Filburn <em>v.</em> People’s Palace Company), it was held that an elephant
“did not belong to a class which, according to the experience of mankind,
is not dangerous to man, and therefore the owner kept such an
animal at his own risk, and his liability for damage done by it was not
affected by his ignorance of its dangerous character.” Mew’s Digest
of English Case Law, p. 199.</p>

<p class='c007'>I understand the remarks of my learned predecessor in Maung Gyi
<em>v.</em> Po To above cited to go no further than to suggest that a man
should be liable for injury caused by his animal, whether tame or wild,
if it is proved that the injury was due to the owner’s negligence. In
that view, it would not be necessary to draw a distinction between
wild and domestic animals. The point for decision would be whether
the owner was guilty of negligence or whether he used such care as in
the circumstances of the case was reasonable and ordinarily sufficient.
The amount of care required would vary according to the class of the
animal and according to its known disposition. It could not, I think,
be laid down in this country that a man is liable for any damage done
by his elephant without any proof of negligence or that he knew it to
be of a vicious disposition. In view of the manner in, and extent to,
which elephants are employed in this country such a proposition
would be manifestly unjust.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present case, therefore, I think it was for the plaintiff to
prove that the damage done to his elephant was caused, or rendered
possible, by the defendant’s negligence. In considering the question
of negligence, the defendant’s knowledge or want of knowledge that
her elephant was of a vicious disposition would be an important point.
In a suit of this kind, where an animal like an elephant is concerned,
I think the burden of proving negligence is in the first place on the
plaintiff who avers it. It might be otherwise if injury by a tiger or
bear were concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>I agree with the Lower Courts in thinking that it is not proved that
the defendant knew that the elephant “Kya Gyi” was of a vicious
disposition. It was therefore not incumbent on her to take more than
ordinary precautions with him. It does not seem to be shown that
ordinary precautions were neglected. It is alleged that “Kya Gyi”
twice gored the deceased elephant “Do,” and the mahout called by
the plaintiff declares that he had neither bell nor fetters. On the
other hand, as pointed out in the judgment of the Court of First Instance,
the plaintiff himself admitted that “Kya Gyi” had a bell and
fetters on the second occasion. It is admitted that all the other elephants
of the defendant had bells and fetters. There is direct evidence,
at least as good as that for the plaintiff, that “Kya Gyi” was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>properly provided with them. In my opinion it has not been proved
that there was any negligence on the part of the defendant, and any
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> case made out by the plaintiff has been rebutted. I therefore
hold that the Lower Courts have rightly decided that the defendants
are not liable; and I dismiss this appeal with costs.<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c015'><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'>BOSTOCK-FERARI AMUSEMENT COMPANY <em>v.</em> BROCKSMITH<br /> <span class='sc'>Appellate Court, Indiana, February 14, 1895.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 34 Indiana Appellate Court Reports, 566.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Action by Otto Brocksmith against Bostock-Ferari Amusement
Company. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Comstock, C. J.</span> The complaint alleges that the plaintiff, while
driving in his buggy, was injured in consequence of his horse taking
fright from the sight of a bear walking along a public street in the
city of Vincennes. The action was begun in the Circuit Court of
Knox County, and, upon change of venue, tried in the Circuit Court
of Sullivan County. The court rendered judgment upon the verdict
of the jury in favor of appellee for $750. The complaint was in three
paragraphs. The first was dismissed, and the cause was tried upon
the amended second and third paragraphs, to which general denial
was filed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The errors relied upon are the action of the court in overruling demurrers
to said second and third paragraphs, respectively, of the
complaint, and overruling appellant’s motion for a new trial. Some
of the reasons set out in the motion for a new trial are that the verdict
was contrary to the law, and was not sustained by sufficient
evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question of the sufficiency of the second paragraph of the complaint
is not entirely free from doubt, but we conclude that each of
said paragraphs is sufficient to withstand a demurrer.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is sought to maintain an action for damages resulting from the
fright of a horse at the sight of a bear, which his keeper and owner
was leading along a public street, for the purpose of transporting him
from a railroad train, by which he had been carried to Vincennes, to
the point in Vincennes at which the bear was to be an exhibit as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>part of appellant’s show. It is not claimed, either by allegation or
proof, that the show was in itself unlawful; and there is no pretence
that the transporting of the bear from one place to another for the
purpose of exhibition was unlawful, or in itself negligence. The case
is therefore one of the fright of a horse merely at the appearance of the
bear while he was being led along the street, was making no noise or
other demonstration, and was in the control of his keeper. It appears
without contradiction from the evidence that when the horse took
fright the bear was doing nothing except going with his keeper. He
was muzzled. He had a ring in his nose to which a chain was attached.
Said chain was strong enough to hold and control him. He
had around his neck a collar about two inches wide and one-half inch
thick, to which also was attached a chain. The keeper had both
chains in his hand when the accident occurred. The chain connected
with the ring in his nose was small. The one connected with his collar
was large. It was for the purpose of chaining him at night when
he was alone. The chains were strong enough to control the bear.
The animal was characterized by the witnesses who knew him as
“gentle,” “kind,” “docile.” His keeper testified that he had never
known him to be mean or to growl. He testified also that he never
knew of a bear scaring a horse; that shortly before the accident the
keeper met two ladies in a buggy, and their horse did not scare. He
was described as of pretty good size and brown. One witness said he
was a “large, ugly-looking, brown bear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When a person is injured by an attack by an animal <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferae naturae</span></i>,
the negligence of the owner is presumed, because the dangerous propensity
of such an animal is known, and the law recognizes that safety
lies only in keeping it secure. 2 Am. and Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.),
p. 351. In the case before us the injury did not result from any
vicious propensity of the bear. He did nothing but walk in the
charge of his owner and keeper, Peter Degeleih. He was being moved
quietly upon a public thoroughfare for a lawful purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have given the facts that are not controverted. There is also
evidence leading strongly to support the claim made by appellant
that appellee was guilty of negligence, proximately contributing
to his injury. Appellant also earnestly argues—supporting its
argument with references to recognized authorities—that the owner
and keeper of the bear was an independent contractor. But the
disposition which we think should be made of the appeal makes it
unnecessary to consider these questions. The liability of the appellant
must rest on the doctrine of negligence. The gist of the action
as claimed by appellee is the transportation of the bear, with knowledge
that he was likely to frighten horses, without taking precaution
to guard against fright.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. An animal <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferae naturae</span></i>, reduced to captivity, is the property of
its captor, 2 Blackstone’s Comm., *391, *403; 4 Blackstone’s Comm.,
*235, *236.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>2. The owner of the bear had the right to transport him from one
place to another for a lawful purpose, and it was not negligence per
se for the owner or keeper to lead him along a public street for such
purpose. Scribner <em>v.</em> Kelley, (1862) 38 Barb. 14; Macomber <em>v.</em>
Nichols, (1876) 34 Mich. 212, 22 Am. Rep. 522; Ingham, Law of
Animals, p. 230.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The conducting of shows for the exhibition of wild or strange
animals is a lawful business. The mere fact that the appearance of a
chattel, whether an animal or an inanimate object, is calculated to
frighten a horse of ordinary gentleness, does not deprive the owner of
such chattel of his lawful right to transport his property along a public
highway. Macomber <em>v.</em> Nichols, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>; Holland <em>v.</em> Bartch, (1889)
120 Ind. 46, 16 Am. St. 307; Wabash, etc., R. Co. <em>v.</em> Farver, (1887)
111 Ind. 195, 60 Am. Rep. 696; Gilbert <em>v.</em> Flint, etc., R. Co., (1883) 51
Mich. 488, 16 N. W. 868, 47 Am. Rep. 592; Piolette <em>v.</em> Simers, (1894)
106 Pa. St. 95, 51 Am. Rep. 496. One must use his own so as not
unnecessarily to injure another, but the measure of care to be employed
in respect to animals and other property is the same. It is
such care as an ordinarily prudent person would employ under similar
circumstances. This is not inconsistent with the proposition that if an
animal <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferae naturae</span></i> attacks and injures a person, the negligence of the
owner or keeper is presumed. The evidence is that the horse was of
ordinary gentleness, but this fact would not deprive the appellant of
the right to make proper use of the street. If the bear had been carelessly
managed, or permitted to make any unnecessary noise or
demonstration, it would have been an act of negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not uncommon for horses of ordinary gentleness to become
frightened at unaccustomed sights on the public highway. The automobile,
the bicycle, the traction-engine, the steam roller may each be
frightful to some horses, but still they may be lawfully used on the
public streets. King David said, “An horse is a vain thing for
safety.” Modern observation has fully justified the statement. A
large dog, a great bull, a baby wagon may each frighten some horses,
but their owners are not barred from using them upon the streets on
that account. Nor under the decisions would the courts be warranted
in holding that the owner of a bear, subjugated, gentle, docile, chained,
would not, under the facts shown in the case at the bar, be permitted
to conduct the homely brute along the public streets because of his
previous condition of freedom.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Scribner <em>v.</em> Kelley, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, the court said: “It does not appear
that the elephant was at large, but on the contrary that he was in
the care, and apparently under the control, of a man who was riding
beside him on a horse; and the occurrence happened before the passage
of the act of April 2, 1862, regulating the use of public highways.
There is nothing in the evidence to show that the plaintiff’s
horse was terrified because the object he saw was an elephant, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>only that he was frightened because he suddenly saw moving upon a
highway, crossing that upon which he was travelling, and fully one
hundred feet from him, a large animate object to which he was unaccustomed—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non
constat</span></i> that any other moving object of equal size
and differing in appearance from such as he was accustomed to see
might not have inspired him with similar terror. The injury which
resulted from his fright is more fairly attributed to a lack of ordinary
courage and discipline in himself, than to the fact that the object
which he saw was an elephant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>4. It is alleged in the complaint that the bear was an object likely
to frighten a horse of ordinary gentleness, which fact the appellant
well knew. There is no evidence that the bear was an object likely to
frighten horses of ordinary gentleness, nor that the appellant knew
that the bear was an object likely to frighten horses of ordinary gentleness.
The evidence shows, so far as the observation of the keeper and
the appellant gave information, that the bear had not frightened
horses.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The facts upon the question of negligence are undisputed, and that
question is therefore to be determined by the court as a matter of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judgment is reversed, with instruction to sustain appellant’s motion
for a new trial.<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c015'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'>MARLOR <em>v.</em> BALL<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Court of Appeal, March 1, 1900.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 16 Times Law Reports, 239.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>This was an application by the defendant for judgment or a new
trial in an action tried before Mr. Justice Phillimore and a special
jury at Manchester. The action was brought to recover damages for
personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff through being bitten by a
zebra belonging to the defendant. The plaintiff was a working man.
The defendant was the proprietor of the Chadderton-hall pleasuregrounds,
at Oldham, where he kept an exhibition of wild animals.
The plaintiff went with his wife and his brother-in-law to see the exhibition,
and, having paid for admission, entered the gardens. While
they were walking along they found the door of a stable standing
open, and went in. There were four zebras inside the stable, each in
a separate stall and properly tied up by a halter to the manger. The
plaintiff went up to one of the zebras and stroked it. The animal
kicked out, and the plaintiff being then standing against the partition,
the animal pressed him through the partition, and he fell into the
next stall, where another zebra bit his hand, which had to be amputated.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>At the trial the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for
£175.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Mr. Montague Lush</em>, for the defendant, in support of the application
for judgment or a new trial, contended that there was no evidence
on which the defendant could be held liable. The common law obligation
of a person who kept animals <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferae naturae</span></i> was to keep them
secure, or, in other words, to prevent them from getting loose. He
was liable to an action, if, in consequence of a failure on his part to
comply with that obligation, any other person was injured. In such
a case it was not necessary for the plaintiff to allege negligence. But
in this case there had been no failure to comply with that common
law obligation. Here the animals were kept secure, they were not
loose. The plaintiff, therefore, had to allege negligence, and the alleged
negligence appeared to be this, that the defendant did not provide
a keeper, or some physical barrier to prevent people from
meddling with the animals. But this allegation did not show a cause
of action at all. There was no authority for saying that an action lay
for not preventing the plaintiff from bringing an injury on himself.
It was not sufficient for the plaintiff here to show that the door was
open. The door being open might be an invitation to go in, but it was
not an invitation to meddle by stroking the zebras. The plaintiff
failed to show any negligence on the part of the defendant, and he had
no remedy. Counsel referred to Filburn <em>v.</em> The People’s Palace and
Aquarium Company (Limited), 25 Q. B. D. 258; and Memberz <em>v.</em>
The Great Western Railway Company, 14 App. Cas. 179.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Mr. S. T. Evans</em>, for the plaintiff, said the foundation of the action
was that zebras were dangerous animals, and it was the duty of persons
who kept dangerous animals to prevent them from doing injury. The
leaving the door of the stable unlocked was a default on the part of
the defendant. The plaintiff was not in any way warned that these
zebras were wild animals. The evidence taken altogether showed
that these zebras were kept in much the same way as horses would
ordinarily be kept. He referred to May <em>v.</em> Burdett, 9 Q. B. 101.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court allowed the application and ordered judgment to be
entered for the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Justice A. L. Smith</span> said it was conceded that a zebra was
a dangerous animal, and that by law a man who kept a dangerous animal
must do so at his peril, and that if any damage resulted, then,
apart from any question of negligence, he was liable for the damage.
But that was subject to this, that the person who complained of damage
must not have brought the injury on himself. Where the plaintiff
did something which he had no business to do,—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</span></i> by meddling,
as the plaintiff in this case had done,—then the defendant was not
liable. That was common law, and it was also common sense. In
Filburn <em>v.</em> The People’s Palace (Limited), Lord Esher expressly
dealt with this point. He there said: “It cannot possibly be said that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>an elephant comes within the class of animals known to be harmless by
nature, or within that shown by experience to be harmless in this
country, and consequently it falls within the class of animals that a
man keeps at his peril, and which he must prevent from doing injury
under any circumstances, unless the person to whom the injury is done
brings it on himself.” The action, therefore, could not be maintained
on the common law liability. The plaintiff then set up a claim for
negligence, viz., that the door was not kept locked, and that there was
no keeper at hand. The evidence showed that the door had been
shut, but had got opened. If the plaintiff had been kicked while
walking along the stable, an action might have lain, but the plaintiff
went into the stall and meddled with the animal. Even if the fact of
the door being open was an invitation to go into the stable, it was not
an invitation to stroke the animals. In his opinion there was no
evidence to go to the jury, and judgment must be entered for the
defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Justice Collins</span> said the plaintiff’s case was put on the
footing of these zebras being wild animals. The duty of a person who
owned a wild animal, as laid down in May <em>v.</em> Burdett, was to keep it
secure at his peril. The evidence in this case all went to show that
these animals were kept secure within the meaning of that case. In
his opinion there was no evidence of any invitation to go and tamper
with the animals.</p>

<p class='c014'>Action on the case, in which the plaintiff declared that on the
twentieth of June, in the eleventh of the king, the defendant <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quendam

<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per publica compita</span></i>, so that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro defectu curæ</span></i> of the defendant
the plaintiff was bit and worried by the said dog, as he was peaceably
going about his business in such a street. There was another count, in
which it was laid that the defendant knew the dog <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad mordend. assuet</span></i>.
To the first count there was a demurrer, and to the second not guilty.<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c015'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Gould, J.</span> No doubt but in the case of sheep there ought to be a
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sciens</span></i>, because that is an accidental quality, and not in the nature of
a dog. And as to property of a dog, the Books distinguish; for a man
has a property in a dog that is a mastiff or spaniel, for the one is for
the guard of his house, the other for his pleasure; but this here is a
mongrel, and laid to be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">valde ferocem</span></i>, and that must be an innate
fierceness, and not accidental; and if a dog be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">assuet</span></i>. to bite cows, and
the master know it, that will not be sufficient knowledge to make him
liable for his biting sheep. Besides, this case is distinguishable in respect
of the place, for the law takes notice of highway, and is a security
for passengers; and it would be dangerous to keep such dogs near
the highway, where all sorts of people pass at all hours; and to maintain
this issue, they must give a natural fierceness in evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Holt, C. J.</span> If it had been said that the defendant knew the dog
to be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferox</span></i>, I should think it enough. The difference is between things
in which the party has a valuable property, for he shall answer for all
damages done by them; but of things in which he has no valuable
property, if they are such as are naturally mischievous in their kind,
he shall answer for hurt done by them without any notice; but if they
are of a tame nature, there must be notice of the ill quality; and the
law takes notice that a dog is not of a fierce nature, but rather the
contrary; and the presumption is against the plaintiff; for can it be
imagined a man would keep a fierce dog in his family wittingly? If
any beast in which I have a valuable property do damage in another’s
soil, in treading his grass, trespass will lie for it; but if my dog go
into another man’s soil, no action will lie. See the case of Millan <em>v.</em>
Hawtree, 1 Jones, 131, Poph. 161, Latch, 13, 119, that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i> is the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gît</span></i> of the action; and so is 1 Cro., where it was doubted whether the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i> should go to the keeping or quality; nor does it appear here
but it was an accidental fierceness, or suppose it were an innate one to
this dog particularly; and it had been given to the owner but an hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>before, shall he take notice of all the qualities of his dog at his peril,
or shall he have his action against the giver for bestowing him a
naughty dog? In case a dog bites pigs, which almost all dogs will do,
a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i> is necessary. 1 Cro. 255. And I do not doubt but if it be
generally laid that a dog was used to bite <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">animalia</span></i>, and the defendant
knew of it, it will be enough to charge him for biting of sheep, &amp;c.;
and by <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">animalia</span></i> shall not be intended frogs or mice, but such in which

<h5 class='c013'><span class='sc'>De</span> GRAY <em>v.</em> MURRAY<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New Jersey, June 8, 1903.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 69 New Jersey Law Reports, 458.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Gummere, C. J.</span> This was an action to recover for injuries resulting
to the plaintiff in error (the plaintiff below) from the bite of a
dog, owned by the defendant in error, which attacked her while she
was walking on the public street. At the close of the testimony the
trial judge directed a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff seeks
to review the judgment entered upon that verdict.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the settled law that the owner of a dog will not be held responsible
for injuries resulting to another person from its bite unless it
be shown that the dog had previously bitten some one else, or was
vicious, to the knowledge of the owner. Smith <em>v.</em> Donohue, 20 Vroom,
548, and cases cited.</p>

<p class='c007'>[After discussing the evidence, and holding that there was an utter
failure to prove <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i>.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>But even if the evidence submitted would support the conclusion
that the dog had a propensity to bite, and that what the defendant
heard about its attack on the boy charged him with knowledge of that
propensity, the direction of a verdict in his favor was not erroneous.
In England, and in some of our sister states, it is held that the owner
of an animal which has a propensity to attack and bite mankind,
who keeps it with the knowledge that it has such a propensity, does
so at his peril, and that his liability for injuries inflicted by it is absolute.
A leading case is that of May <em>v.</em> Burdett, 9 Q. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 112,
in which it is stated that “the conclusion to be drawn from all the
authorities appears to be this: that a person keeping a mischievous
animal, with knowledge of its propensity, is bound to keep it secure at
his peril, and that if it does mischief, negligence is presumed without
express averment. The negligence is in keeping such an animal after
notice.” Subsequently, the Court of Exchequer Chamber, adopting
as accurate the principle underlying the decision of May <em>v.</em> Burdett,
and referring to the opinion in that case, among others, as an authority
for its conclusion, declared, in the case of Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands,
L. R. 1 Exch. 265, that “one who, for his own purposes, brings upon
his land, and keeps there, anything likely to do mischief if it escapes,
is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence
of its escape.” The application of this principle led the court
to fix liability upon the owner of land, who had stored water in a reservoir
built thereon, for injury done to adjoining property by water
escaping from the reservoir, notwithstanding that such escape was
not due to any negligence on the part of the owner. Ten years after
the decision of Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands, the rule laid down in that case was
applied in this state, at circuit, in the case of Marshall <em>v.</em> Welwood, 9
Vroom, 339, and the owner of a steam boiler, which blew up and
wrecked adjacent property, was held liable for the damage done, notwithstanding
the fact that the bursting of the boiler was not due to
any negligence on his part. The case was subsequently reviewed here,
on rule to show cause, and this court, in a masterly opinion by the late
Chief Justice Beasley, expressly disapproved of the doctrine laid down
in Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands (which, as I have already stated, is rested,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>among other decisions, on May <em>v.</em> Burdett), and declared that no man
is, in law, an insurer that the acts which he does, such acts being lawful
and done with care, shall not injuriously affect others; and that an injury
which results from a lawful act, done in a lawful manner, and
without negligence on the part of the person doing the act, will not
support an action. Applying that principle to the case in hand, this
court then held that the owner of a steam boiler, which he has in use
on his own property, is not responsible, in the absence of negligence,
for the damages done by its bursting. The principle laid down in
Marshall <em>v.</em> Welwood was reiterated by this court in the case of Hill <em>v.</em>
Ulshowski, 32 Id. 375.</p>

<p class='c007'>The right of a man to keep a vicious dog for the protection of his
home and property is conceded in the case of Roehers <em>v.</em> Remhoff, 26
Vroom, 475. He is, of course, bound to exercise a degree of care, commensurate
with the danger to others which will follow the dog’s escape
from his control, to so secure it that it will not injure any one
who does not unlawfully provoke or intermeddle with it. Worthen <em>v.</em>
Love, 60 Vt. 285. But if the owner does use such care, and the dog
nevertheless escapes and inflicts injury, he is not liable.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case now under consideration the undisputed evidence makes
it clear that the defendant fully discharged the duty of using due
care to prevent the escape of his dog from his premises, and that the
plaintiff’s injury was not due to any neglect in that regard upon his
part. She was bitten in the early morning, between half-past six and
seven o’clock. On the preceding evening the defendant shut the dog
in his carpenter shop (which adjoined his dwelling) and locked him
in. During the night the dog gnawed away the woodwork from
around the lock of the door to such an extent that the lock became
detached, thus permitting the door to open and the dog to escape.
That a reasonably prudent man would not have anticipated any such
occurrence must be admitted.</p>

  <h5 class='c013'>CROWLEY <em>v.</em> GROONELL<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Vermont, February 9, 1901.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 73 Vermont Reports, 45.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Case for an injury to the plaintiff by the defendant’s dog. Plea,
the general issue. Trial by jury, Rutland County, March Term, 1900,
Rowell, J., presiding. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. The
defendant excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appeared that the plaintiff, an old man, was a neighbor of the defendant
and went one morning to the defendant’s barn, where the latter
was, to buy some potatoes of him; that when the plaintiff got
near the barn, the defendant’s dog, which was large, and was lying
near the barn door, assaulted the plaintiff by jumping up and putting
his feet upon him and throwing him down, breaking his hip. The
testimony was conflicting as to whether this assault was vicious or
playful and as to the propensities of the dog known to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Watson, J.</span> The only exception upon which the defendant relies
is the one to that part of the charge where the court said that a cross
and savage disposition on the part of the dog was not necessary in
order to impose liability; that a mischievous propensity to commit
the kind of assault complained of was enough if the plaintiff’s case
was otherwise made out; and that in respect to imposing liability, it
made no difference whether such assault proceeded from good nature
or ill nature, from ugliness or playfulness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant contends that the duty of restraint attaches only
when the owner or keeper has reason to apprehend that the dog
may do damage by reason of its viciousness or ferocity, and that
the acts of the dog, proceeding from good nature or playfulness,
cannot render the defendant liable. If a man have a beast that
is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferae naturae</span></i> as a lion, a bear, a wolf, if he get loose and do harm
to any person, the owner is liable to an action for damages, though
he have no particular notice that he had done any such thing before.
The same principle applies to damages done by domestic animals,
except that as to them, the owner must have seen or heard enough
to convince a man of ordinary prudence of the animal’s inclination
to commit the class of injuries complained of. With notice to the
owner of such propensity in the animal, he is liable for whatever
damages may be suffered by person or property therefrom. It makes
no difference whether the animal was of cross and savage disposition
and committed the injury by reason of its viciousness and ferocity,
or whether such injury resulted from good nature and playfulness—the
intent of the animal is not material. The owner or keeper having
knowledge of its disposition to commit such injuries must restrain it
at his peril, and it is no answer to say that the animal was not cross
or savage and was in good nature and playfulness.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>In State <em>v.</em> McDermott, 6 Atl. Rep. 653 [49 N. J. Law, 163], at
the close of the plaintiff’s evidence, the defendant moved for a nonsuit
on the ground that it did not appear that the dog had bitten
McDermott maliciously, and also on the ground that there was no evidence
that the dog had bitten other persons except in play, or that
the defendant had knowledge of the propensity of the dog to bite.
The motion was overruled. It was contended that although several
persons had been bitten by the dog, of which the defendant had
notice, yet it appeared that in every instance the biting occurred
while the dog was in a playful mood; that damages could not be recovered
where it was shown that the dog had a propensity to bite
only in play; and that to justify a recovery, it must appear that the
dog was in the habit of biting mankind while in an angry mood, actuated
by a ferocious spirit. It was held that this was not the law,—that
an action could be maintained against the owner by a party injured
upon evidence that a dog, with the knowledge of the owner, had
a mischievous propensity to bite mankind, whether in anger or not;
for in either case, the person bitten would suffer injury, and that mischievous
propensity, within the meaning of the law, was a propensity
from which injury is the natural result.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'><em>There was no error in the charge, and judgment is affirmed.</em><a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c015'><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Erle, C. J., in</span> COX <em>v.</em> BURBIDGE<br /> (1863) <cite>13 Common Bench, New Series, 435–437.</cite></h5>

<p class='c014'>I am of opinion that this rule must be made absolute, on the ground
that there was a total absence of evidence to support the cause of
action alleged. The facts I take to be these: The plaintiff, a child of
tender age, was lawfully upon the highway, and a horse, the property
of the defendant, was straying on the highway. As between the
owner of the horse and the owner of the soil of the highway or of
the herbage growing thereon, we may assume that the horse was trespassing;
and, if the horse had done any damage to the soil, the owner
of the soil might have had a right of action against his owner. So,
it may be assumed, that if the place in question were a public highway,
the owner of the horse might have been liable to be proceeded
against under the Highway Act. But, in considering the claim of the
plaintiff against the defendant for the injury sustained from the kick,
the question whether the horse was a trespasser as against the owner
of the soil, or whether his owner was amenable under the Highway
Act, has nothing to do with the case of the plaintiff. I am also of
opinion that so much of the argument which has been addressed to us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>on the part of the plaintiff as assumes the action to be founded upon
the negligence of the owner of the horse in allowing it to be upon the
road unattended, is not tenable. To entitle the plaintiff to maintain
the action, it is necessary to show a breach of some legal duty due from
the defendant to the plaintiff; and it is enough to say that there is no
evidence to support the affirmative of the issue that there was negligence
on the part of the defendant for which an action would lie by
the plaintiff. The simple fact found is, that the horse was on the
highway. He may have been there without any negligence of the
owner: he might have been put there by a stranger, or might have
escaped from some enclosed place without the owner’s knowledge.
To entitle the plaintiff to recover, there must be some affirmative proof
of negligence in the defendant in respect of a duty owing to the plaintiff.
But, even if there was any negligence on the part of the owner
of the horse, I do not see how that is at all connected with the damage
of which the plaintiff complains. It appears that the horse was
on the highway, and that, without anything to account for it, he
struck out and injured the plaintiff. I take the well-known distinction
to apply here, that the owner of an animal is answerable for any damage
done by it, provided it be of such a nature as is likely to arise from
such an animal, and the owner knows it. Thus, in the case of a dog,
if he bites a man or worries sheep, and his owner knows that he is
accustomed to bite men or to worry sheep, the owner is responsible;
but the party injured has no remedy unless the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i> can be proved.
This is very familiar doctrine; and it seems to me that there is much
stronger reason for applying that rule in respect of the damage done
here. The owner of a horse must be taken to know that the animal
will stray if not properly secured, and may find its way into his neighbor’s
corn or pasture. For a trespass of that kind, the owner is of
course responsible. But if the horse does something which is quite
contrary to his ordinary nature,—something which his owner has no
reason to expect he will do, he has the same sort of protection that
the owner of a dog has; and everybody knows that it is not at all the
ordinary habit of a horse to kick a child on a highway. I think the
ground upon which the plaintiff’s counsel rests his case fails. It reduces
itself to the question whether the owner of a horse is liable for
a sudden act of a fierce and violent nature which is altogether contrary
to the usual habits of the horse, without more.<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c015'><sup>[273]</sup></a></p>

  <h5 class='c013'>DICKSON <em>v.</em> MCCOY<br /> <span class='sc'>Court of Appeals, New York, June Term, 1868.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 39 New York Reports, 400.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This was an action for injury to the plaintiff by the horse of the
defendant. The plaintiff, a child of ten years, was passing the stable
of the defendant, upon the sidewalk of a populous street in the city of
Troy, when the defendant’s horse came out of the stable, going loose
and unattended, and, in passing, kicked the plaintiff in the face. The
complaint alleged that the horse was “of a malicious and mischievous
disposition, and accustomed to attack and injure mankind;” also,
that the defendant “wrongfully and negligently suffered the said
horse to go at large in and upon the public streets,” etc. The proof as
to the disposition of the horse was only to the effect that he was young
and playful, and, when loose in the street, was accustomed to run and
kick in the air, but had never been seen to kick at any person. The
defendant moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that there was no proof
that the horse was vicious, which was refused. The defendant also requested
the court to charge that there was no proof that the horse was
possessed of any vicious propensity, or mischievous habit, which required
the defendant to exercise special care over him; which the
court declined to charge. The court did charge, that “it was for the
jury to find, under the evidence, whether the defendant was or was not
guilty of negligence in permitting the animal, which did the injury
complained of, to run at large, as detailed by the witnesses on the part
of the plaintiff,” etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for $500, which was
affirmed, on appeal, at the General Term, and the defendant appeals
to this court.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dwight, J.</span> I agree with the counsel for the defendant that there
is no proof in the case to sustain the allegation in the complaint, that
this horse was vicious and accustomed to attack and injure mankind.
The fact that a horse is young and playful, that he kicks in the air,
and runs and gambols when loose in the street, is no proof of a malicious
or vicious disposition. But I regard the allegation as unnecessary,
and the absence of proof on the point as not affecting the right
to recover. The finding of the jury, under the charge of the court, was
clearly to the effect that the defendant was guilty of negligence in
suffering his horse to go at large upon the sidewalk, as shown in the
case. And there was a sufficient allegation to that effect in the complaint.
It is not necessary that a horse should be vicious to make the
owner responsible for injury done by him through the owner’s negligence.
The vice of the animal is an essential fact only when, but for
it, the conduct of the owner would be free from fault. If the most
gentle horse be driven so negligently as to do injury to persons or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>property, the owner or driver will be responsible. Certainly, not less
so if the horse be negligently turned loose in the street without restraint
or control. The motion for a nonsuit was properly denied.
The only question in the case was that propounded by the court to the
jury, “was the defendant guilty of negligence in permitting the horse
to go at large in the street?” The court, I think, might very properly
have charged as requested by the defendant, that there was no proof to
justify the jury in finding that the horse was possessed of any vicious
propensity or mischievous habit. And, yet, it is, in one sense, a mischievous
habit for a horse to run and play in the public streets.
Though it is no proof of a mischievous disposition, it is liable to
produce mischievous results. There was, therefore, no error in the
refusal to charge as requested. The instructions of the court to the
jury were correct, and the verdict is conclusive upon all the questions
in the case.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is an action on the case<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c015'><sup>[275]</sup></a> to recover the value of a horse
alleged to have been injured by the defendant’s horse, and comes forward
on exceptions to the rulings of Goodenow, J.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff introduced evidence tending to prove that at night, on
the 13th of September, 1855, he put his horse into his field well and
uninjured. The next morning, September 14, his horse and the defendant’s
were together in his, the plaintiff’s close, the defendant’s
horse, having, during the night, escaped from the defendant’s enclosure,
or from the highway, into the close of the plaintiff, and that
the plaintiff’s horse was severely injured by the defendant’s horse, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>kicking, biting, or striking with his fore feet, or in some other way, so
that he died in a few days after.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant requested the presiding judge to instruct the jury
that to entitle the plaintiff to recover against the defendant he must
prove, in addition to other necessary facts, that the defendant’s horse
was vicious, and that the defendant had knowledge of such viciousness
prior to the time of the alleged injury.
The presiding judge declined giving these instructions, and directed
the jury that if they should find that the defendant owned the horse
alleged to have done the injury to the plaintiff’s horse, and if, at the
time of the injury, he had escaped into the plaintiff’s close, and was
wrongfully there, and while there occasioned the injury, and that the
horse died in consequence, that the plaintiff would be entitled to recover
the value of the horse so injured. That it was not necessary for
the plaintiff to prove that the horse was vicious, or accustomed to acts
of violence towards other animals or horses, or that the owner had
notice of such viciousness or habits.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c015'><sup>[276]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Davis, J.</span> There are three classes of cases in which the owners of
animals are liable for injuries done by them to the persons or the
property of others. And in suits of such injuries the allegations and
proofs must be varied in each case, as the facts bring it within one or
another of these classes.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The owner of wild beasts, or beasts that are in their nature
vicious, is, under all circumstances, liable for injuries done by them.
It is not necessary, in actions for injuries by such beasts, to allege or
prove that the owner knew them to be mischievous, for he is conclusively
presumed to have such knowledge; or that he was guilty of
negligence in permitting them to be at large, for he is bound to keep
them in at his peril.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Though the owner have no particular notice that he did any such
thing before, yet if he be a beast that is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferae naturae</span></i> if he get loose
and do harm to any person, the owner is liable to an action for the
damage.” 1 Hale, P. C. 430.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If they are such as are naturally mischievous in their kind, in
which the owner has no valuable property, he shall answer for hurt
done by them, without any notice; but if they are of a tame nature,
there must be notice of the ill quality.” Holt, C. J. Mason <em>v.</em> Keeling,
12 Mod. R. 332.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The owner of beasts that are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferae naturae</span></i> must always keep them
up, at his peril; and an action lies without notice of the quality of the
beasts.” Rex <em>v.</em> Huggins, 2 Lord Raym. 1583.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. If domestic animals, such as oxen and horses, injure any one, in
person or property, if they are rightfully in the place where they do
the mischief, the owner of such animals is not liable for such injury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>unless he knew that they were accustomed to do mischief. And in
suits for such injuries, such knowledge must be alleged, and proved.
For unless the owner knew that the beast was vicious he is not liable.
If the owner had such knowledge he is liable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The gist of the action is the keeping of the animal after knowledge
of its vicious propensities.” May <em>v.</em> Burdett, 58 Eng. C. L. 101.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the owner have knowledge of the quality of his beast, and it
doth anybody hurt, he is chargeable in an action for it.” 1 Hale P. C.
430.</p>

<p class='c007'>“An action lies not unless the owner knows of this quality.” Buxendin
<em>v.</em> Sharp, 2 Salk. 662.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the owner puts a horse or an ox to grass in his field, and the
horse or ox breaks the hedge and runs into the highway, and gores or
kicks some passenger, an action will not lie against the owner unless
he had notice that they had done such a thing before.” Mason <em>v.</em>
Keeling, 12 Modern R. 332.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If damage be done by any domestic animal, kept for use or convenience,
the owner is not liable to an action on the ground of negligence,
without proof that he knew that the animal was accustomed to
do mischief.” Vrooman <em>v.</em> Sawyer, 13 Johns. R. 339.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The owner of domestic animals, if they are wrongfully in the
place where they do any mischief, is liable for it, though he had no
notice that they had been accustomed to do so before. In cases of
this kind the ground of the action is that the animals were wrongfully
in the place where the injury was done. And it is not necessary to
allege or prove any knowledge on the part of the owner that they had
previously been vicious.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If a bull break into an enclosure of a neighbor, and there gore a
horse so that he die, his owner is liable in an action of trespass <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quare
clausum fregit</span></i>, in which the value of the horse would be the just
measure of damages.” Dolph <em>v.</em> Ferris, 7 Watts &amp; Serg. R. 367.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the owner of a horse suffers it to go at large in the streets of a
populous city he is answerable in an action on the case for a personal
injury done by it to an individual without proof that he knew that the
horse was vicious. The owner had no right to turn the horse loose
in the streets.” Goodman <em>v.</em> Gay, 3 Harris R. 188. In this case
the writ contained the allegation of knowledge on the part of the
defendant; but the court held that it was not material and need not
be proved.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case before us is clearly within this class of cases last described.
It is alleged in the writ that “the plaintiff had a valuable horse which
was peaceably and of right depasturing in his own close, and the defendant
was possessed of another horse, vicious and unruly, which was
running at large where of right he ought not to be; and being so unlawfully
at large, broke into the plaintiff’s close, and injured the plaintiff’s
horse, &amp;c.” It is also alleged that “the vicious habits of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>horse were well known to the defendant;” but this allegation was not
necessary, and may well be treated as surplusage. If the defendant
had had a right to turn his horse upon the plaintiff’s close it would
have been otherwise. But if the horse was wrongfully there the defendant
was liable for any injury done by him, though he had no
knowledge that the horse was vicious. The gravamen of the charge
was that the horse was wrongfully upon the plaintiff’s close; and this
was what was put in issue by the plea of not guilty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor are these principles in conflict with the decision in the case of
Van Leuven <em>v.</em> Lyke, 1 Comstock, 515. In that case the action was
not sustained because the declaration was not for trespass <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quare
clausum</span></i> with the other injuries alleged by way of aggravation. But
in that case there was no allegation that the animal was wrongfully
upon the plaintiff’s close; or that the injury was committed upon the
plaintiff’s close. 4 Denio R. 127. And in the Court of Appeals it
was expressly held that “if the plaintiff had stated in his declaration
that the swine broke and entered his close, and there committed the
injury complained of, and sustained his declaration by evidence, he
would been entitled to recover all the damages thus sustained.”
1 Coms. 515, 518.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case before us, though the declaration is not technically for
trespass <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quare clausum</span></i>, it is distinctly alleged that the defendant’s
horse, “being so unlawfully at large, broke and entered the plaintiff’s
close, and injured the plaintiff’s horse,” which was there peaceably and
of right depasturing. This was sufficient; and the instruction given
to the jury, “that if the defendant’s horse, at the time of the injury,
had escaped into the close, and was wrongfully there, and while there
occasioned the injury, then the plaintiff would be entitled to recover,”
was correct. And this being so, the instruction requested “that the
plaintiff must prove, in addition to other necessary facts, that the defendant’s
horse was vicious, and that the defendant had knowledge of
such viciousness prior to the time of the injury,” was properly refused.</p>

  <h5 class='c013'>DOYLE <em>v.</em> VANCE<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Victoria, April 16, 1880.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 6 Victorian Law Reports, Cases at Law, 87.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Stawell, C. J.</span><a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c015'><sup>[278]</sup></a> A dog belonging to the defendant got on land
belonging to the plaintiff, how, does not appear, and barked at a horse
of the plaintiff which was then grazing quietly in an inclosed field;
the horse ran away, tried to leap over the fence, fell and broke its
neck. The plaint was in the ordinary form, alleging a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i> in the
defendant. At the trial, an application was made to add a count for
trespass by the dog on the plaintiff’s land. The application was
granted, and though the amendment was not formally written on the
plaint, it may now be considered as having been made. A verdict was
given for the plaintiff, with £10 damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant has appealed, and the question we have to consider is
whether, as a matter of law, he is liable for the trespass committed by
his dog. It would have been competent for the judge at the trial to
have found that the dog was on the land, by the leave and license of
the plaintiff; all the circumstances point to the probability of that
being the case. But he has found that the dog was there as a trespasser.
There are a number of cases in which judges have expressed
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiter dicta</span></i>, as to the non-liability of an owner for injuries done by
his dog, and curious and singular reasons—that a dog was the companion
of man (and the like)—have been assigned for those <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</span></i>;
reasons which courts have treated as entitled to high respect, and
which have not been dissented from. There is, however, a comparatively
recent case, Read <em>v.</em> Edwards, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c015'><sup>[279]</sup></a> in which an action was
brought against the owner of a dog for having chased and destroyed
game, the declaration alleging <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i> by the defendant. All the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</span></i> of the learned judges to which I have referred were cited in the
argument, were commented on and received attention. The case was
decided on another point, but Mr. Justice Willes, who delivered the
judgment of the Court, said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The question was much argued whether the owner of the dog is
answerable in trespass for every unauthorized entry of the animal into
the land of another, as in the case of an ox, and reasons were offered,
which we need not now estimate, for a distinction in this respect between
oxen, and dogs or cats, on account, first, of the difficulty or
impossibility of keeping the latter under restraint; secondly, the
slightness of the damage which their wandering ordinarily causes;
thirdly, the common usage of mankind to allow them a wider liberty;
and lastly, their not being considered in law so absolutely the chattels
of the owner as to be the subject of larceny. It is not, however,
necessary in the principal case to answer that question.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>The legitimate inference from these observations is that the question,
whether the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</span></i> I have referred to are law, has not yet been
decided, and that the subject is open for consideration. There may be
very cogent reasons, socially, for exempting the owner from liability.
But there is no reason which a court of law can recognize. Serious
injury might be inflicted by a dog revelling in a highly-cultivated
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parterre</span></i>, and can it with propriety be said that the owner of the garden
can obtain no compensation? It has been decided that a dog can
be distrained for <em>damage feasant</em>: Bunch <em>v.</em> Kennington, 1 Q. B. 679.
There can be no question, if an ox were substituted for a dog, as having
done the mischief complained of in the present case, the owner
would be liable. Cox <em>v.</em> Burbidge, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c015'><sup>[280]</sup></a> which was cited, does not
apply. There, the defendant’s horse, being on the highway, kicked
the plaintiff, a child who was playing there. The defendant was held
not guilty of actionable negligence; but that was on the ground that
the horse had a right to be on the highway, as well as the child, and
was therefore not a trespasser.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Lee <em>v.</em> Riley, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c015'><sup>[281]</sup></a> through defect of fences which it was the
defendant’s duty to repair, the defendant’s mare strayed in the night
time from his close into an adjoining field, and so into a field of the
plaintiff’s, in which was a horse. From some unexplained cause the
animals quarrelled, and the result was that the plaintiff’s horse received
a kick from the defendant’s mare, which broke its leg, and it
was necessarily killed. It was held that the defendant was answerable
for the mare’s trespass, and the damage was not too remote. The
decision was based on the fact that the defendant’s mare trespassed on
the plaintiff’s land, and that it was the duty of the owner of an animal
to keep it from trespassing. In Ellis <em>v.</em> The Loftus Iron Co., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c015'><sup>[282]</sup></a>
the defendant’s horse having injured the plaintiff’s mare by biting
and kicking her through the fence separating the plaintiff’s land from
the defendants’, it was held that there was a trespass by the act of the
defendants’ horse, for which the defendants were liable, apart from
any question of negligence on their part.</p>

<p class='c007'>The owner of an animal is therefore responsible for any damage
fairly resulting from a trespass by that animal. The damage here has
resulted from the trespass, and the verdict will therefore stand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The argument based upon “The Dog Act 1864” (No. 229), sec. 15,
enacting that the owner of a dog shall be liable for injury done to
sheep, without proof of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i>, should be noticed; it was urged that
the necessity for passing such an enactment implied that there was
previously no liability. But that argument goes too far. One part of
the enactment is declaratory, and the other is new.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Barry, J.</span> I am of the same opinion. It is remarkable that this
question should not have been settled until now, and, apparently from
a desire to avoid overruling old cases which had been decided on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>most subtle reasons, the judges have abstained from considering the
question in a broad aspect. The old reports abound with expressions
of peculiar regard for dogs and cats; and Lord Tenterden does not
think it beneath his dignity to quote, in his book on shipping, “if
mice eat the cargo, and thereby occasion no small injury to the merchant,
the master must make good the loss, because he is guilty of a
fault; yet if he had cats on board his ship, he shall be excused.” One
reason given for the exemption of liability, so far as the dog is concerned,
is on account of his familiarity with man. But we cannot
regard these every day questions in the same subtle way as they were
regarded three hundred years ago. The doctrine of trespass is considered
on much more reasonable grounds in these days. Where sheep,
oxen, or horses, commit a trespass, it has always been held that the
owner is liable; and that liability has been extended to poultry, and
poultry are as much domesticated as a dog or a cat. In Brown <em>v.</em>
Giles, 1 C. &amp; P. 118, Mr. Justice Park is reported to have said that
he was decidedly of opinion that a dog jumping into a field without the
consent of its master, not only was not a trespass, but was no trespass
at all on which an action could be maintained. But that remark was
merely <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiter</span></i>; the case was decided for the plaintiff on another point.
The learned judge has found that there was a trespass. The dog was
left to roam at its discretion, uncontrolled by its master.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Stephen, J.</span> I also concur. It seems to have been considered, in
old times, that there was a marked distinction between trespass by a
dog, and trespass by an ox. Now, as a general rule, no such distinction
is made. I cannot see why there should be any. This case illustrates
how far the law ought to be altered, so as to preserve its accordance
with change of time and place. Of course, the Court cannot
alter the clearly-expressed language of an act of Parliament, though
the reason for it may have ceased. And so also as to actual decisions
of the Courts. If there is reason to alter the law, the legislature must
do it. But on this question, there have been no more than <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiter
dicta</span></i> based upon reasons which have no longer any existence. At one
time a dog could not be the subject of a theft. The Court is at liberty,
within reasonable limits, to meet the changed circumstances of the present
day. I can see no sound reason why there should be a difference
between the case of trespass by a dog, and one by an ox.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Trespass for personal injuries. Before Brégy, J.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears from the evidence that the plaintiff, a lady about fifty-five
years of age, was temporarily living with her son, in a small
country place, and the cow of the defendant strayed into the garden
belonging to the son. The plaintiff, seeing the cow in the garden,
came out of her son’s house and attempted to drive the cow out of the
garden back into the pasture field, from where she entered into the
garden. The plaintiff alleges that while so driving the cow out of
the garden back into the field, the cow deliberately went towards the
field, and that she followed closely behind the cow, when the cow suddenly
turned her head and butted the plaintiff in the abdomen, and
hence her injuries.<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c015'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant requested (Request No. 5) a ruling, that, under all the
evidence, the verdict should be for the defendant. The court declined
so to rule. Verdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant
appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Smith, J.</span> It is not necessary, in disposing of this case, to determine
the liability of the owner of a domestic animal for all its acts
while trespassing upon another’s land. In such cases, the primary
trespass is the entry of the animal upon the land; the attendant damage
for which the owner may be held liable is matter of aggravation.
The minimum liability of the owner is for acts arising from the natural
propensities of the species, and from special characteristics and
acquired habits of the individual of which the owner has notice.
When the primary trespass is the wilful act of the owner, he may be
held to a larger measure of responsibility; thus if he take a dog into
a field where he is himself a trespasser, and the dog there kills or injures
sheep, this, though its first offence, may be laid as an aggravation
of the trespass: Beckwith <em>v.</em> Shordike, Burr. 2092; Michael <em>v.</em>
Alestree, 2 Lev. 172, cited in Dolph <em>v.</em> Ferris, 7 W. &amp; S. 367. Beyond
this, the authorities appear unsettled, and principle and analogy form
the only guide. Doubtless there may be mischief so far independent
of the primary trespass, and unrelated to the propensity or habit leading
to this, that it cannot be deemed matter of aggravation. In my
view, however, the mischievous act, when incident to the primary
trespass, in any of its aspects, or so closely associated with it as to
form a substantive part or an immediate result of it, is a legitimate
matter of aggravation, for which the owner should be held liable. In
such case, the propensity or habit leading to the primary trespass may
be regarded as the proximate cause of the resulting injury. If, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>example, trespassing cattle, in order to reach the vegetation in a hotbed,
break its glass covering, the owner must be held liable for this
injury, though cattle are not by nature prone to break glass. Such
breaking is incident to the primary trespass, and grows out of the
propensity leading to this. If an animal injure a person lawfully trying
to prevent it from trespassing, the owner should be held liable,
though the injury be one which the animal is not prone to commit.
In such case the mischievous act is closely associated with the primary
trespass, and in fact grows directly out of it. The same principle
must govern if a person be injured in trying to prevent the continuance
of a trespass, or of acts forming an aggravation of it.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>In this view of the principles which should govern the determination
of this case, the injury to the plaintiff must be deemed an aggravation
of the trespass committed by the animal in entering the garden.
This injury, indeed, is not such as a cow is ordinarily prone to commit;
and there is no evidence that the defendant’s cow had contracted
the habit of making such assaults. But the act of the animal was one
to which a creature of that kind is naturally disposed on being disturbed
while feeding; and it was so directly associated with the
primary trespass that, unless the plaintiff’s right to prevent a continuance
of this be denied, there can be no ground for questioning the
liability of the owner. This right cannot be controverted, for under
the circumstances the act of the plaintiff is to be regarded as that of
the tenant of the premises. The act of the animal by which the
plaintiff was injured, so far from being independent of the primary
trespass, or unrelated to it, grew directly out of the propensity in
which this originated, coupled with the plaintiff’s attempt to prevent
its continuance. The defendant’s fifth point was therefore properly
refused. The case was submitted to the jury with suitable instructions,
and their finding on the questions involved was concurred in by
the trial court.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>The judgment is affirmed.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Wickham, J.</span> (dissenting.)&#160;... We are called on to determine
whether the rule, so far as our authority goes, shall be established in
Pennsylvania, that the owner of a useful, gentle, and domestic animal,
belonging to a class recognized from the earliest times as harmless to
man, watched, driven to and from the pasture fields, fed and milked
by women and children the world over, shall be responsible for the
conduct of the animal, foreign to its well-known nature and habits, if
it happen that through any negligence of such owner, or his servant,
it is permitted to trespass on the land of another, and there injures a
third party.</p>

<p class='c007'>The authorities on this subject are numerous and impossible to
reconcile. Some of them rest on statutes or ordinances, not always
adverted to in the text-books or digests, in which they are hastily
cited. Others are based on the theory, that the right to recover exists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>because of the trespass to realty, and that any unusual and not to be
expected injury caused by the animal to the person of the owner of
the land, or his other property, must be alleged and proved by way of
aggravation of damages. Another class of cases holds that all injuries
committed by an animal, in a place where it has no right to be, must
be compensated for by the owner. It is on the latter theory of the
law that the plaintiff must recover, if she can sustain her action, as
we do not deem it worth while to notice the few erratic and sporadic
cases, seemingly decided on no discoverable reason, except an assumed
natural equity, that any one injured by anything, animate or inanimate,
belonging to another, should be compensated by the owner.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>As has already been observed, the plaintiff was not the owner of
the land trespassed upon, and it may be remarked that she is aided
by no statute.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>It is argued that the appellant’s cow was vicious. There is no evidence
even suggesting such a tendency, and the learned trial judge so
instructed the jury. Conceding that the animal was breachy, as
alleged by the plaintiff, this indicated no ferocity or proneness to attack
people. Any one, acquainted with the nature and habits of
horses and cows, knows that usually the most intelligent and gentle
animals of these species are the most cunning and successful in finding
their way into forbidden inclosures and the readiest to run away
when discovered. As was said in Keshan <em>v.</em> Gates, 2 Thomp. &amp; C.
(N. Y. Sup. Ct.) 288: “The vicious habits or propensities which the
owner of an animal must, when known to him, guard against, are such
as are directly dangerous, such as kicking and biting in horses, and
hooking in horned animals, and biting in dogs. These habits or
propensities may be indulged in at any moment and are inevitably
dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The adoption of the rule, sanctioned by the decisions of many respectable
tribunals in other states, that the owner of every trespassing
domestic animal is liable merely because it is a trespasser for all injuries
it may commit, however contrary to its usual nature and disposition,
and regardless of his knowledge of its special viciousness,
might often lead to strange and unthought-of consequences. For instance,
suppose that a pet lamb, always regarded as a harmless playmate
of children, is permitted to wander from its owner’s premises
into those of a neighbor (this as well as the next illustration is not a
supposititious case), and there, in play or anger, butts a child from a
high veranda, or a trespassing hatching hen, discovered on its nest by
the little son of the owner of the premises, pecks out the eye of the
boy as he is lawfully trying to drive it away, the unfortunate owner
would be liable in each instance for all the resulting damages. In
vain would he urge that the animal causing the injury belonged to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>class ordinarily docile in its nature and harmless to man; that he had
no reason to anticipate that it would do such unusual mischief; and
that he was only responsible for the things hens, lambs, and milch
cows usually do and may be expected to do when trespassing, that is,
for the natural and probable consequences of their trespasses. The
answer, under the rule we are considering, would be: “You were
guilty of negligence in permitting your animal to trespass, and therefore
you are liable for all its freaks, for the consequences of the wrong,
near and remote, probable and improbable, for the things you had
reason to anticipate, and those which no one would be likely to think
could happen, save as a remote possibility.” The results which might
follow the application of such a rule demand its rejection, where it
has not already been fully adopted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only negligence of the defendant revealed by the evidence was
his failure to keep his cow out of the garden of the plaintiff’s son.
To the latter, the defendant would certainly be liable for the harm
done to the realty, but as he had no notice or knowledge of any vicious
or ferocious propensity on the part of the animal, we do not think
that he should be mulcted in damages for the unfortunate injury suffered
by the plaintiff, nor, for that matter, even to the owner of the
land, had such owner been injured in like manner. The appellant’s
fifth point, asking the court to direct a verdict in his favor, should
have been affirmed.</p>

<p class='c014'>In November, 1861, Fletcher brought an action against Rylands
and Horrocks to recover damages for an injury caused to his mines by
water flowing into them from a reservoir which defendants had constructed.
The declaration (set out in L. R. 1 Exch. 265, 266) contained
three counts, each count alleging negligence on the part of the
defendants. The case came on for trial at the Liverpool Summer
Assizes, 1862, when a verdict was entered for the plaintiff, subject to
an award to be thereafter made by an arbitrator. Subsequently the
arbitrator was directed, instead of making an award, to state a special
case for the consideration of the Court of Exchequer.<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c015'><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The material facts in the special case stated by the arbitrator were
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Fletcher, under a lease from Lord Wilton, and under arrangements
with other landowners, was working coal mines under certain lands.
He had worked the mines up to a spot where he came upon old horizontal
passages of disused mines, and also upon vertical shafts which
seemed filled with marl and rubbish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rylands and Horrocks owned a mill standing on land near that
under which Fletcher’s mines were worked. With permission of Lord
Wilton, they constructed on Lord Wilton’s land a reservoir to supply
water to their mill. They employed a competent engineer and competent
contractors to construct the reservoir. It was not known to
Rylands and Horrocks, nor to any of the persons employed by them,
that any coal had ever been worked under or near the site of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>reservoir; but in point of fact the coal under the site of the reservoir
had been partially worked at some time or other beyond living
memory, and there were old coal workings under the site of the reservoir
communicating by means of other and intervening old underground
workings with the recent workings of Fletcher.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of constructing and excavating for the bed of the said
reservoir, five old shafts, running vertically downwards, were met with
in the portion of land selected for the site of the said reservoir. At
the time they were so met with the sides or walls of at least three of
them were constructed of timber, and were still in existence, but the
shafts themselves were filled up with marl, or soil of the same kind as
the marl or soil which immediately surrounded them, and it was not
known to, or suspected by, the defendants, or any of the persons employed
by them in or about the planning or constructing of the said
reservoir, that they were (as they afterwards proved to be) shafts
which had been made for the purpose of getting the coal under the
land in which the said reservoir was made, or that they led down to
coal workings under the site of the said reservoir.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the selection of the site of the said reservoir, and for the planning
and constructing thereof, it was necessary that the defendants
should employ an engineer and contractors, and they did employ for
those purposes a competent engineer and competent contractors, by
and under whom the said site was selected and the said reservoir was
planned and constructed, and on the part of the defendants themselves
there was no personal negligence or default whatever in or about or
in relation to the selection of the said site, or in or about the planning
or construction of the said reservoir; but in point of fact reasonable
and proper care and skill were not exercised by or on the part of the
persons so employed by them, with reference to the shafts so met with
as aforesaid, to provide for the sufficiency of the said reservoir to bear
the pressure of water which, when filled to the height proposed, it
would have to bear.</p>

<p class='c007'>The said reservoir was completed about the beginning of December,
1860, when the defendants caused the same to be partially filled with
water, and on the morning of the 11th December in the same year,
whilst the reservoir was so partially filled, one of the shafts which had
been so met with as aforesaid gave way and burst downwards; in consequence
of which the water of the reservoir flowed into the old workings
underneath, and by means of the underground communications
so then existing between those old coal workings and the plaintiff’s
coal workings in the plaintiff’s colliery, as above described, large quantities
of the water so flowing from the said reservoir as aforesaid found
their way into the said coal workings in the plaintiff’s colliery, and
by reason thereof the said colliery became and was flooded, and the
working thereof was obliged to be and was for a time necessarily
suspended.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>The question for the opinion of the Court was whether the plaintiff
was entitled to recover damages from the defendants by reason of the
matters thus stated by the arbitrator.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court of Exchequer (<span class='sc'>Pollock, C. B.</span>, and <span class='sc'>Martin, B.</span>, concurring;
<span class='sc'>Bramwell, B.</span>, dissenting) gave judgment for defendants.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>Plaintiff brought error in the Exchequer Chamber.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>May 14, 1866. The judgment of the Court (<span class='sc'>Willes</span>, <span class='sc'>Blackburn</span>,
<span class='sc'>Keating</span>, <span class='sc'>Mellor</span>, <span class='sc'>Montague Smith</span>, and <span class='sc'>Lush, JJ.</span>) was delivered
by</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Blackburn, J.</span> This was a special case stated by an arbitrator,
under an order of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi prius</span></i>, in which the question for the Court is
stated to be, whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover any and, if
any, what damages from the defendants by reason of the matters
thereinbefore stated.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Court of Exchequer, the Chief Baron and Martin, B., were
of opinion that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover at all, Bramwell,
B., being of a different opinion. The judgment in the Exchequer
was consequently given for the defendants, in conformity with the
opinion of the majority of the Court. The only question argued before
us was whether this judgment was right, nothing being said about
the measure of damages in case the plaintiff should be held entitled
to recover. We have come to the conclusion that the opinion of Bramwell,
B., was right, and that the answer to the question should be that
the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages from the defendants by
reason of the matters stated in the case, and consequently that the
judgment below should be reversed, but we cannot at present say to
what damages the plaintiff is entitled.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears from the statement in the case that the plaintiff was
damaged by his property being flooded by water which, without
any fault on his part, broke out of a reservoir constructed on the
defendants’ land by the defendants’ orders, and maintained by the
defendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears from the statement in the case [see pp. 267–268], that
the coal under the defendants’ land had, at some remote period, been
worked out; but this was unknown at the time when the defendants
gave directions to erect the reservoir, and the water in the reservoir
would not have escaped from the defendants’ land, and no mischief
would have been done to the plaintiff, but for this latent defect in the
defendants’ subsoil. And it further appears [see pp. 268–269] that
the defendants selected competent engineers and contractors to make
their reservoir, and themselves personally continued in total ignorance
of what we have called the latent defect in the subsoil; but that these
persons employed by them in the course of the work became aware
of the existence of the ancient shafts filled up with soil, though they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>did not know or suspect that they were shafts communicating with old
workings.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is found that the defendants, personally, were free from all blame,
but that in fact proper care and skill was not used by the persons employed
by them to provide for the sufficiency of the reservoir with
reference to these shafts. The consequence was that the reservoir
when filled with water burst into the shafts, the water flowed down
through them into the old workings, and thence into the plaintiff’s
mine, and there did the mischief.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff, though free from all blame on his part, must bear the
loss, unless he can establish that it was the consequence of some default
for which the defendants are responsible. The question of law
therefore arises, what is the obligation which the law casts on a person
who, like the defendants, lawfully brings on his land something which,
though harmless whilst it remains there, will naturally do mischief if
it escape out of his land. It is agreed on all hands that he must take
care to keep in that which he has brought on the land and keeps there,
in order that it may not escape and damage his neighbors; but the
question arises whether the duty which the law casts upon him, under
such circumstances, is an absolute duty to keep it in at his peril, or
is, as the majority of the Court of Exchequer have thought, merely a
duty to take all reasonable and prudent precautions in order to keep it
in, but no more. If the first be the law, the person who has brought
on his land and kept there something dangerous, and failed to keep
it in, is responsible for all the natural consequences of its escape. If
the second be the limit of his duty, he would not be answerable except
on proof of negligence, and consequently would not be answerable for
escape arising from any latent defect which ordinary prudence and
skill could not detect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Supposing the second to be the correct view of the law, a further
question arises subsidiary to the first, viz., whether the defendants are
not so far identified with the contractors whom they employed as to be
responsible for the consequences of their want of care and skill in
making the reservoir in fact insufficient with reference to the old
shafts, of the existence of which they were aware, though they had
not ascertained where the shafts went to.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think that the true rule of law is that the person who for his own
purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything
likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it in at his peril, and if
he does not do so, is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> answerable for all the damage which
is the natural consequence of its escape. He can excuse himself by
showing that the escape was owing to the plaintiff’s default; or perhaps
that the escape was the consequence of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>, or the act of
God; but as nothing of this sort exists here, it is unnecessary to inquire
what excuse would be sufficient. The general rule, as above
stated, seems on principle just. The person whose grass or corn is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>eaten down by the escaping cattle of his neighbor, or whose mine is
flooded by the water from his neighbor’s reservoir, or whose cellar
is invaded by the filth of his neighbor’s privy, or whose habitation is
made unhealthy by the fumes and noisome vapors of his neighbor’s
alkali works, is damnified without any fault of his own; and it seems
but reasonable and just that the neighbor, who has brought something
on his own property which was not naturally there, harmless to others
so long as it is confined to his own property, but which he knows to be
mischievous if it gets on his neighbor’s, should be obliged to make
good the damage which ensues if he does not succeed in confining it to
his own property. But for his act in bringing it there no mischief
could have accrued, and it seems but just that he should at his peril
keep it there, so that no mischief may accrue, or answer for the natural
and anticipated consequences. And upon authority, this we think
is established to be the law, whether the things so brought be beasts,
or water, or filth, or stenches.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case that has most commonly occurred and which is most frequently
to be found in the books is as to the obligation of the owner of
cattle which he has brought on his land to prevent their escaping and
doing mischief. The law as to them seems to be perfectly settled from
early times; the owner must keep them in at his peril, or he will be
answerable for the natural consequences of their escape; that is, with
regard to tame beasts, for the grass they eat and trample upon, though
not for any injury to the person of others, for our ancestors have
settled that it is not the general nature of horses to kick, or bulls to
gore; but if the owner knows that the beast has a vicious propensity
to attack man, he will be answerable for that too.</p>

<p class='c007'>As early as the Year Book, 20 Ed. 4, 11, placitum 10, Brian, C. J.,
lays down the doctrine in terms very much resembling those used by
Lord Holt in Tenant <em>v.</em> Goldwin, 2 Ld. Raym. 1089, 1 Salk. 360,
which will be referred to afterwards. It was trespass with cattle.
Plea, that the defendant’s land adjoined a place where defendant had
common, that the cattle strayed from the common, and defendant
drove them back as soon as he could. It was held a bad plea. Brian,
C. J., says: “It behoves him to use his common so that he shall do no
hurt to another man, and if the land in which he has common be not
enclosed, it behoves him to keep the beasts in the common and out of
the land of any other.” He adds, when it was proposed to amend by
pleading that they were driven out of the common by dogs, that although
that might give a right of action against the master of the
dogs, it was no defence to the action of trespass by the person on whose
land the cattle went. In the recent case of Cox <em>v.</em> Burbidge, 13 C. B.
<span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 438, 32 L. J. C. P. 89, Williams, J., says: “I apprehend the general
rule of law to be perfectly plain. If I am the owner of an animal
in which by law the right of property can exist, I am bound to take
care that it does not stray into the land of my neighbor, and I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>liable for any trespass it may commit, and for the ordinary consequences
of that trespass. Whether or not the escape of the animal is
due to my negligence is altogether immaterial.” So in May <em>v.</em> Burdett,
9 Q. B. 112, the Court, after an elaborate examination of the old
precedents and authorities, came to the conclusion that “a person
keeping a mischievous animal, with knowledge of its propensities, is
bound to keep it secure at his peril.” And in 1 Hale’s Pleas of the
Crown, 430, Lord Hale states that where one keeps a beast, knowing
its nature or habits are such that the natural consequence of his being
loose is that he will harm men, the owner “must at his peril keep him
up safe from doing hurt; for though he use his diligence to keep him
up, if he escape and do harm, the owner is liable to answer damages;”
though, as he proceeds to show, he will not be liable criminally without
proof of want of care. In these latter authorities the point under
consideration was damage to the person, and what was decided was,
that where it was known that hurt to the person was the natural consequence
of the animal being loose, the owner should be responsible in
damages for such hurt, though where it was not known to be so, the
owner was not responsible for such damages; but where the damage is,
like eating grass or other ordinary ingredients in damage feasant, the
natural consequence of the escape, the rule as to keeping in the animal
is the same. In Com. Dig. <em>Droit.</em> (M. 2), it is said that “if the owner
of 200 acres in a common moor enfeoffs B. of 50 acres, B. ought to
enclose at his peril, to prevent damage by his cattle to the other 150
acres. For if his cattle escape thither they may be distrained damage
feasant. So the owner of the 150 acres ought to prevent his cattle
from doing damage to the 50 acres at his peril.” The authority cited
is Dyer, 372 <em>b</em>., where the decision was that the cattle might be distrained;
the inference from that decision, that the owner was bound
to keep in his cattle at his peril, is, we think, legitimate, and we have
the high authority of Comyns for saying that such is the law. In the
note to Fitzherbert, Nat. Brevium, 128, which is attributed to Lord
Hale, it is said, “If A. and B. have lands adjoining, where there is no
enclosure, the one shall have trespass against the other on an escape of
their beasts respectively: Dyer, 372, Rastal Ent. 621, 20 Ed. 4, 10;
although wild dogs, &amp;c., drive the cattle of the one into the lands of
the other.” No case is known to us on which in replevin it has ever
been attempted to plead in bar to an avowry for distress damage
feasant, that the cattle had escaped without any negligence on the
part of the plaintiff, and surely if that could have been a good plea in
bar, the facts must often have been such as would have supported it.
These authorities, and the absence of any authority to the contrary,
justify Williams, J., in saying, as he does in Cox <em>v.</em> Burbidge, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,
that the law is clear that in actions for damage occasioned by animals
that have not been kept in by their owners, it is quite immaterial
whether the escape is by negligence or not.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>As has been already said, there does not appear to be any difference
in principle between the extent of the duty cast on him who brings
cattle on his land to keep them in, and the extent of the duty imposed
on him who brings on his land water, filth, or stenches, or any other
thing which will, if it escape, naturally do damage, to prevent their
escaping and injuring his neighbor; and the case of Tenant <em>v.</em> Goldwin,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, is an express authority that the duty is the same, and is,
to keep them in at his peril.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Martin, B., in his judgment below, appears not to have understood
that case in the same manner as we do, it is proper to examine it
in some detail. It was a motion in arrest of judgment after judgment
by default, and therefore all that was well pleaded in the declaration
was admitted to be true. The declaration is set out at full length in
the report in 6 Mod. p. 311. It alleged that the plaintiff had a cellar
which lay contiguous to a messuage of the defendant, “and used (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">solebat</span></i>)
to be separated and fenced from a privy house of office, parcel of
the said messuage of defendant, by a thick and close wall, which belongs
to the said messuage of the defendant, and by the defendant of
right ought to have been repaired (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure debuit reparari</span></i>).” Yet he
did not repair it, and for want of repair filth flowed into plaintiff’s
cellar. The case is reported by Salkeld, who argued it, in 6 Mod.,
and by Lord Raymond, whose report is the fullest. The objection
taken was that there was nothing to show that the defendant was
under any obligation to repair the wall, that, it was said, being a
charge not of common right, and the allegation that the wall <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure
debuit reparari</span></i> by the defendant being an inference of law which did
not arise from the facts alleged. Salkeld argued that this general
mode of stating the right was sufficient in a declaration, and also that
the duty alleged did of common right result from the facts stated. It
is not now material to inquire whether he was or was not right on the
pleading point. All three reports concur in saying that Lord Holt,
during the argument, intimated an opinion against him on that, but
that after consideration the Court gave judgment for him on the
second ground. In the report of 6 Mod. 314, it is stated: “And at
another day <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per totam curiam</span></i>. The declaration is good; for there is a
sufficient cause of action appearing in it; but not upon the word
‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">solebat</span></i>.’ If the defendant has a house of office enclosed with a wall
which is his, he is of common right bound to use it so as not to annoy
another.... The reason here is, that one must use his own so as
thereby not to hurt another, and as of common right one is bound to
keep his cattle from trespassing on his neighbor, so he is bound to use
anything that is his so as not to hurt another by such use.... Suppose
one sells a piece of pasture lying open to another piece of pasture
which the vendor has, the vendee is bound to keep his cattle from
running into the vendor’s piece; so of dung or anything else.” There
is here an evident allusion to the same case in Dyer, see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 334, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>is referred to in Com. Dig. <em>Droit.</em> (M. 2). Lord Raymond in his report,
2 Ld. Raym. at p. 1092, says: “The last day of term, Holt, C.
J., delivered the opinion of the Court that the declaration was sufficient.
He said that upon the face of this declaration there appeared a
sufficient cause of action to entitle the plaintiff to have his judgment;
that they did not go upon the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">solebat</span></i>, or the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure debuit reparari</span></i>, as if it
were enough to say that the plaintiff had a house and the defendant
had a wall, and he ought to repair the wall; but if the defendant has
a house of office, and the wall which separates the house of office from
the plaintiff’s house is all the defendant’s, he is of common right bound
to repair it.... The reason of this case is upon this account, that
every one must so use his own as not to do damage to another; and
as every man is bound so to look to his cattle as to keep them out of
his neighbor’s ground, that so he may receive no damage; so he must
keep in the filth of his house of office that it may not flow in upon and
damnify his neighbor.... So if a man has two pieces of pasture
which lie open to one another, and sells one piece, the vendee must
keep in his cattle so as they shall not trespass upon the vendor. So a
man shall not lay his dung so high as to damage his neighbor, and the
reason of these cases is because every man must so use his own as not
to damnify another.” Salkeld, who had been counsel in the case, reports
the judgment much more concisely (1 Salk. 361), but to the
same effect; he says: “The reason he gave for his judgment was because
it was the defendant’s wall and the defendant’s filth, and he was
bound of common right to keep his wall so as his filth might not
damnify his neighbor, and that it was a trespass on his neighbor, as
if his beasts should escape, or one should make a great heap on the
border of his ground, and it should tumble and roll down upon his
neighbor’s,&#160;... he must repair the wall of his house of office, for he
whose dirt it is must keep it that it may not trespass.” It is worth
noticing how completely the reason of Lord Holt corresponds with
that of Brian, C. J., in the cases already cited in 20 Ed. 4. Martin, B.,
in the Court below says that he thinks this was a case without difficulty,
because the defendant had, by letting judgment go by default,
admitted his liability to repair the wall, and that he cannot see how it
is an authority for any case in which no such liability is admitted. But
a perusal of the report will show that it was because Lord Holt and his
colleagues thought (no matter for this purpose whether rightly or
wrongly) that the liability was not admitted, that they took so much
trouble to consider what liability the law would raise from the admitted
facts, and it does therefore seem to us to be a very weighty
authority in support of the position that he who brings and keeps anything,
no matter whether beasts, or filth, or clean water, or a heap of
earth or dung on his premises, must at his peril prevent it from getting
on his neighbor’s, or make good all the damage which is the natural
consequence of its doing so. No case has been found in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>question as to the liability for noxious vapors escaping from a man’s
works by inevitable accident has been discussed, but the following
case will illustrate it. Some years ago several actions were brought
against the occupiers of some alkali works at Liverpool for the damage
alleged to be caused by the chlorine fumes of their works. The defendants
proved that they at great expense erected contrivances by which
the fumes of chlorine were condensed and sold as muriatic acid, and
they called a great body of scientific evidence to prove that this apparatus
was so perfect that no fumes possibly could escape from the
defendants’ chimneys. On this evidence it was pressed upon the jury
that the plaintiff’s damage must have been due to some of the numerous
other chimneys in the neighborhood; the jury, however, being
satisfied that the mischief was occasioned by chlorine, drew the conclusion
that it had escaped from the defendants’ works somehow, and
in each case found for the plaintiff. No attempt was made to disturb
these verdicts on the ground that the defendants had taken every
precaution which prudence or skill could suggest to keep those fumes
in, and that they could not be responsible unless negligence were
shown; yet, if the law be as laid down by the majority of the Court of
Exchequer, it would have been a very obvious defence. If it had been
raised the answer would probably have been that the uniform course
of pleading in actions on such nuisances is to say that the defendant
caused the noisome vapors to arise on his premises, and suffered them
to come on the plaintiff’s, without stating that there was any want of
care or skill in the defendant, and that the case of Tenant <em>v.</em> Goldwin,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, showed that this was founded on the general rule of law, that
he whose stuff it is must keep it that it may not trespass. There is
no difference in this respect between chlorine and water; both will,
if they escape, do damage, the one by scorching and the other by
drowning, and he who brings them there must at his peril see that they
do not escape and do that mischief. What is said by Gibbs, C. J., in
Sutton <em>v.</em> Clarke, 6 Taunt. 44, though not necessary for the decision of
the case, shows that that very learned judge took the same view of the
law that was taken by Lord Holt. But it was further said by Martin,
B., that when damage is done to personal property, or even to the
person, by collision, either upon land or at sea, there must be negligence
in the party doing the damage to render him legally responsible;
and this is no doubt true, and as was pointed out by Mr. Mellish during
his argument before us, this is not confined to cases of collision, for
there are many cases in which proof of negligence is essential, as, for
instance, where an unruly horse gets on the footpath of a public street
and kills a passenger, Hammack <em>v.</em> White, 11 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 588; 31 L. J.
(C. P.) 129; or where a person in a dock is struck by the falling of a
bale of cotton which the defendant’s servants are lowering: Scott <em>v.</em>
London Dock Company, 3 H. &amp; C. 596; 35 L. J. (Ex.) 17, 220; and
many other similar cases may be found. But we think these cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>distinguishable from the present. Traffic on the highways, whether by
land or sea, cannot be conducted without exposing those whose persons
or property are near it to some inevitable risk; and that being so,
those who go on the highway, or have their property adjacent to it,
may well be held to do so subject to their taking upon themselves the
risk of injury from that inevitable danger; and persons who by the
license of the owner pass near to warehouses where goods are being
raised or lowered, certainly do so subject to the inevitable risk of
accident. In neither case, therefore, can they recover without proof
of want of care or skill occasioning the accident; and it is believed
that all the cases in which inevitable accident has been held an excuse
for what <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> was a trespass, can be explained on the same
principle, viz., that the circumstances were such as to show that the
plaintiff had taken that risk upon himself. But there is no ground for
saying that the plaintiff here took upon himself any risk arising from
the uses to which the defendants should choose to apply their land.
He neither knew what these might be, nor could he in any way control
the defendants, or hinder their building what reservoirs they liked,
and storing up in them what water they pleased, so long as the defendants
succeeded in preventing the water which they there brought from
interfering with the plaintiff’s property.</p>

<p class='c007'>The view which we take of the first point renders it unnecessary to
consider whether the defendants would or would not be responsible for
the want of care and skill in the persons employed by them, under the
circumstances stated in the case [pp. 268–269].</p>

<p class='c007'>We are of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, but as we
have not heard any argument as to the amount, we are not able to
give judgment for what damages. The parties probably will empower
their counsel to agree on the amount of damages; should they differ
on the principle the case may be mentioned again.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Rylands and Horrocks brought error in the House of Lords against
the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber, which had reversed the
judgment of the Court of Exchequer.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Arguments omitted.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Lord Chancellor</span> (Lord Cairns). My Lords, in this case the
plaintiff (I may use the description of the parties in the action) is the
occupier of a mine and works under a close of land. The defendants
are the owners of a mill in his neighborhood, and they proposed to
make a reservoir for the purpose of keeping and storing water to be
used about their mill upon another close of land, which, for the purposes
of this case, may be taken as being adjoining to the close of the
plaintiff, although in point of fact some intervening land lay between
the two. Underneath the close of land of the defendants on which
they proposed to construct their reservoir there were certain old and
disused mining passages and works. There were five vertical shafts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>and some horizontal shafts communicating with them. The vertical
shafts had been filled up with soil and rubbish, and it does not appear
that any person was aware of the existence either of the vertical shafts
or of the horizontal works communicating with them. In the course
of the working by the plaintiff of his mine he had gradually worked
through the seams of coal underneath the close, and had come into
contact with the old and disused works underneath the close of the
defendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>In that state of things the reservoir of the defendants was constructed.
It was constructed by them through the agency and inspection
of an engineer and contractor. Personally, the defendants appear
to have taken no part in the works, or to have been aware of any want
of security connected with them. As regards the engineer and the
contractor, we must take it from the case that they did not exercise,
as far as they were concerned, that reasonable care and caution which
they might have exercised, taking notice, as they appear to have taken
notice, of the vertical shafts filled up in the manner which I have mentioned.
However, my Lords, when the reservoir was constructed and
filled, or partly filled, with water, the weight of the water bearing
upon the disused and imperfectly filled-up vertical shafts, broke
through those shafts. The water passed down them and into the horizontal
workings, and from the horizontal workings under the close of
the defendants it passed on into the workings under the close of the
plaintiff, and flooded his mine, causing considerable damage, for which
this action was brought.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court of Exchequer, when the special case stating the facts to
which I have referred was argued, was of opinion that the plaintiff had
established no cause of action. The Court of Exchequer Chamber, before
which an appeal from this judgment was argued, was of a contrary
opinion, and the judges there unanimously arrived at the conclusion
that there was a cause of action, and that the plaintiff was entitled to
damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, the principles on which this case must be determined
appear to me to be extremely simple. The defendants, treating them
as the owners or occupiers of the close on which the reservoir was constructed,
might lawfully have used that close for any purpose for
which it might in the ordinary course of the enjoyment of land be
used; and if, in what I may term the natural user of that land, there
had been any accumulation of water, either on the surface or under
ground, and if, by the operation of the laws of nature, that accumulation
of water had passed off into the close occupied by the plaintiff,
the plaintiff could not have complained that that result had taken
place. If he had desired to guard himself against it, it would have lain
upon him to have done so by leaving, or by interposing, some barrier
between his close and the close of the defendants in order to have
prevented that operation of the laws of nature.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>As an illustration of that principle, I may refer to a case which was
cited in the argument before your Lordships, the case of Smith <em>v.</em>
Kenrick, in the Court of Common Pleas, 7 C. B. 515.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, if the defendants, not stopping at the natural
use of their close, had desired to use it for any purpose which I may
term a non-natural use,<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c015'><sup>[287]</sup></a> for the purpose of introducing into the close
that which in its natural condition was not in or upon it, for the purpose
of introducing water either above or below ground in quantities
and in a manner not the result of any work or operation on or under
the land; and if in consequence of their doing so, or in consequence
of any imperfection in the mode of their doing so, the water came to
escape and to pass off into the close of the plaintiff, then it appears
to me that that which the defendants were doing they were doing at
their own peril; and if in the course of their doing it the evil arose
to which I have referred, the evil, namely, of the escape of the water
and its passing away to the close of the plaintiff and injuring the
plaintiff, then for the consequence of that, in my opinion, the defendants
would be liable. As the case of Smith <em>v.</em> Kenrick is an illustration
of the first principle to which I have referred, so also the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>principle to which I have referred is well illustrated by another case
in the same Court, the case of Baird <em>v.</em> Williamson, 15 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 317,
which was also cited in the argument at the Bar.</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, these simple principles, if they are well founded, as it
appears to me they are, really dispose of this case.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same result is arrived at on the principles referred to by Mr.
Justice Blackburn in his judgment in the Court of Exchequer Chamber,
where he states the opinion of that Court as to the law in these
words: “We think that the true rule of law is that the person who,
for his own purposes, brings on his land and collects and keeps there
anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it in at his
peril; and if he does not do so, is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> answerable for all the
damage which is the natural consequence of its escape. He can excuse
himself by showing that the escape was owing to the plaintiff’s default;
or, perhaps, that the escape was the consequence of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>, or the
act of God; but as nothing of this sort exists here, it is unnecessary
to inquire what excuse would be sufficient. The general rule, as above
stated, seems on principle just. The person whose grass or corn is
eaten down by the escaping cattle of his neighbor, or whose mine is
flooded by the water from his neighbor’s reservoir, or whose cellar
is invaded by the filth of his neighbor’s privy, or whose habitation is
made unhealthy by the fumes and noisome vapors of his neighbor’s
alkali works, is damnified without any fault of his own; and it seems
but reasonable and just that the neighbor who has brought something
on his own property (which was not naturally there), harmless to
others so long as it is confined to his own property, but which he knows
will be mischievous if it gets on his neighbor’s, should be obliged to
make good the damage which ensues if he does not succeed in confining
it to his own property. But for his act in bringing it there no
mischief could have accrued, and it seems but just that he should at
his peril keep it there, so that no mischief may accrue, or answer for
the natural and anticipated consequence. And upon authority this we
think is established to be the law, whether the things so brought be
beasts, or water, or filth, or stenches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, in that opinion I must say I entirely concur. Therefore,
I have to move your Lordships that the judgment of the Court of
Exchequer Chamber be affirmed, and that the present appeal be dismissed
with costs.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Cranworth.</span> My Lords, I concur with my noble and learned
friend in thinking that the rule of law was correctly stated by Mr.
Justice Blackburn in delivering the opinion of the Exchequer Chamber.
If a person brings, or accumulates, on his land anything which,
if it should escape, may cause damage to his neighbor, he does so at
his peril. If it does escape and cause damage, he is responsible, however
careful he may have been, and whatever precautions he may have
taken to prevent the damage.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>In considering whether a defendant is liable to a plaintiff for damage
which the plaintiff may have sustained, the question in general is
not whether the defendant has acted with due care and caution, but
whether his acts have occasioned the damage. This is all well explained
in the old case of Lambert <em>v.</em> Bessey, reported by Sir Thomas
Raymond (Sir T. Raym. 421). And the doctrine is founded on good
sense. For when one person, in managing his own affairs, causes,
however innocently, damage to another, it is obviously only just that
he should be the party to suffer. He is bound <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic uti suo ut non lædat
alienum</span></i>. This is the principle of law applicable to cases like the present,
and I do not discover in the authorities which were cited anything
conflicting with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine appears to me to be well illustrated by the two modern
cases in the Court of Common Pleas referred to by my noble and
learned friend. I allude to the two cases of Smith <em>v.</em> Kenrick, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,
and Baird <em>v.</em> Williamson, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>. In the former the owner of a coal
mine on the higher level worked out the whole of his coal, leaving no
barrier between his mine and the mine on the lower level, so that the
water percolating through the upper mine flowed into the lower mine,
and obstructed the owner of it in getting his coal. It was held that
the owner of the lower mine had no ground of complaint. The defendant,
the owner of the upper mine, had a right to remove all his
coal. The damage sustained by the plaintiff was occasioned by the
natural flow or percolation of water from the upper strata. There was
no obligation on the defendant to protect the plaintiff against this.
It was his business to erect or leave a sufficient barrier to keep out the
water, or to adopt proper means for so conducting the water as that
it should not impede him in his workings. The water in that case was
only left by the defendant to flow in its natural course.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in the later case of Baird <em>v.</em> Williamson, the defendant, the
owner of the upper mine, did not merely suffer the water to flow
through his mine without leaving a barrier between it and the mine
below, but in order to work in his own mine beneficially he pumped up
quantities of water which passed into the plaintiff’s mine in addition
to that which would have naturally reached it, and so occasioned him
damage. Though this was done without negligence and in the due
working of his own mine, yet he was held to be responsible for the
damage so occasioned. It was in consequence of his act, whether skilfully
or unskilfully performed, that the plaintiff had been damaged,
and he was therefore held liable for the consequences. The damage
in the former case may be treated as having arisen from the act of
God; in the latter, from the act of the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Applying the principle of these decisions to the case now before the
House, I come without hesitation to the conclusion that the judgment
of the Exchequer Chamber was right. The plaintiff had a right to
work his coal through the lands of Mr. Whitehead and up to the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>workings. If water naturally rising in the defendants’ land (we may
treat the land as the land of the defendants for the purpose of this
case) had by percolation found its way down to the plaintiff’s mine
through the old workings, and so had impeded his operations, that
would not have afforded him any ground of complaint. Even if all
the old workings had been made by the plaintiff, he would have done
no more than he was entitled to do; for, according to the principle
acted on in Smith <em>v.</em> Kenrick, the person working the mine under the
close in which the reservoir was made had a right to win and carry
away all the coal without leaving any wall or barrier against Whitehead’s
land. But that is not the real state of the case. The defendants,
in order to effect an object of their own, brought on to their land,
or on to land which for this purpose may be treated as being theirs, a
large accumulated mass of water, and stored it up in a reservoir. The
consequence of this was damage to the plaintiff, and for that damage,
however skilfully and carefully the accumulation was made, the defendants,
according to the principles and authorities to which I have
adverted, were certainly responsible.</p>

<p class='c007'>I concur, therefore, with my noble and learned friend in thinking
that the judgment below must be affirmed, and that there must be
judgment for the defendant in error.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>The plaintiff sued as the surveyor for the County of Chester of
bridges repairable at the expense of the county.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first count of the declaration alleged that the defendant was
possessed of lands and of artificial pools constructed thereon for receiving
and holding, and wherein were kept, large quantities of water,
yet the defendant took so little and such bad care of the pools and the
water therein that large quantities of water escaped from the pools
and destroyed four county bridges, whereby the inhabitants of the
county incurred expense in repairing and rebuilding them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second count alleged that the defendant was possessed of large
quantities of water collected and contained in three artificial pools of
the defendant near to four county bridges, and stated the breach as in
the first count.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plea, not guilty, and issue thereon.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial before <span class='sc'>Cockburn, C. J.</span>, at the Chester Summer Assizes,
1874, the plaintiff’s witnesses gave evidence to the following effect:
The defendant occupied a mansion-house and grounds at Henbury, in
the County of Chester. A natural stream called Bagbrook, which rose
in higher lands, ran through the defendant’s grounds, and after leaving
them flowed under the four county bridges in question. After entering
the defendant’s grounds the stream was diverted and dammed
up by an artificial embankment into a pool of three acres in area
called “the upper pool,” from which it escaped over a weir in the
embankment, and was again similarly dammed up by an artificial
embankment into the “middle pool,” which was between one and two
acres in area. Escaping over a weir in the embankment, it was again
dammed up into “the lower pool,” which was between eight and nine
acres in area, and from which the stream escaped into its natural and
original course.</p>

<p class='c007'>About five o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> on the 18th of June, 1872, occurred a terrible
thunder storm, accompanied by heavy rain, which continued till
about three o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> on the 19th. The rainfall was greater and
more violent than any within the memory of the witnesses, and swelled
the stream both above and in the defendant’s grounds. On the morning
of the 19th it was found that during the night the violence and
volume of the water had carried away the artificial embankments of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>the three pools, the accumulated water in which, being thus suddenly
let loose, had swelled the stream below the pools so that it carried
away and destroyed the county bridges mentioned in the declaration.
At the pools were paddles for letting off the water, but for several
years they had been out of working order.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some engineers and other witnesses gave evidence that in their
opinion the weir in the upper pool was far too small for a pool of that
size, and that the mischief happened through the insufficiency of the
means for carrying off the water. It was not proved when these ornamental
pools were constructed, but it appeared that they had existed
before the defendant began to occupy the property, and that no
similar accident had ever occurred within the knowledge of the
witnesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>After hearing the address of the defendant’s counsel, the jury said
they did not wish to hear his witnesses, and that in their opinion the
accident was caused by <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>. In answer to Cockburn, C. J., they
found that there was no negligence in the construction or maintenance
of the works, and that the rain was most excessive. Cockburn, C. J.,
being of opinion that the rainfall, though extraordinary and unprecedented,
did not amount to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i> or excuse the defendant from liability,
entered the verdict for the plaintiff for 4092<em>l.</em>, the agreed
amount, reserving leave to the defendant to move to enter it for her
if the Court (who were to draw inferences of fact) should be of opinion
that the rainfall amounted to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>, and so distinguished the
case from Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher, L. R. 3 H. L. 330.</p>

<p class='c007'>A rule <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi</span></i> having been accordingly obtained to enter the verdict for
the defendant on the ground that there was no proof of liability, the
plaintiff on showing cause to be at liberty to contend that a new trial
should be granted on the ground that the finding of the jury was
against the weight of evidence—</p>

<p class='c007'>May 27. <em>McIntyre</em>, Q. C., and <em>Coxon</em>, for the plaintiff, showed
cause. The defendant, having for her own purposes and advantage
stored a dangerous element on her premises, is liable if that element
escapes and injures the property of another, even though the escape
be caused by an earthquake or any form of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>[<span class='sc'>Cleasby, B.</span> Was not the flood brought on to the defendant’s
land by <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>?]</p>

<p class='c007'>The pools were made by those through whom the defendant claims,
and if there had been no pools the water of the natural stream would
have escaped without doing injury. The case falls within the rule laid
down by the judgment in Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands, L. R. 1 Ex. 265, 279,
delivered by Blackburn, J.: “We think that the true rule of law is,
that the person who for his own purposes brings on his lands, and collects
and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must
keep it in at his peril, and if he does not do so is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> answerable
for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>He can excuse himself by showing that the escape was owing to the
plaintiff’s default, or perhaps that the escape was the consequence of
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>, or the act of God.” This passage was cited with approval
by Lord Cairns, C., and Lord Cranworth on appeal. L. R. 3 H. L.
330, 339, 340.</p>

<p class='c007'>[<span class='sc'>Cleasby, B.</span> There the defendant brought the water on to his own
land. Not so here.]</p>

<p class='c007'>The intimation that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i> would perhaps be an excuse is not
confirmed by any decision or any other <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictum</span></i>. But the facts here
do not amount to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>. If the weirs had been larger, or the banks
stronger, the mischief would not have happened. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vis major</span></i> means
something which cannot be foreseen or resisted, as an earthquake or
an act of the Queen’s enemies.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Hughes</em> and <em>Dunn</em> (<em>Sir J. Holker</em>, S. G., with them), in support of
the rule, cited Broom’s Legal Maxims, 5th ed. p. 230: “The act of
God signifies in legal phraseology any inevitable accident occurring
without the intervention of man, and may indeed be considered to
mean something in opposition to the act of man, as storms, tempests,
and lightning: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per</span></i> Mansfield, C. J., in Forward <em>v.</em> Pittard, 1 T. R.

<p class='c007'>June 12. The judgment of the Court (<span class='sc'>Kelly, C. B.</span>, <span class='sc'>Bramwell</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Cleasby</span>, BB.) was read by</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bramwell, B.</span> In this case I understand the jury to have found
that all reasonable care had been taken by the defendant, that the
banks were fit for all events to be anticipated, and the weirs broad
enough; that the storm was of such violence as to be properly called
the act of God, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>. No doubt, as was said by Mr. McIntyre,
a shower is the act of God as much as a storm; so is an earthquake in
this country: yet every one understands that a storm, supernatural in
one sense, may properly, like an earthquake in this country, be called
the act of God, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>. No doubt not the act of God or a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis
major</span></i> in the sense that it was physically impossible to resist it, but in
the sense that it was practically impossible to do so. Had the banks
been twice as strong, or if that would not do, ten times, and ten times
as high, and the weir ten times as wide, the mischief might not have
happened. But those are not practical conditions, they are such that
to enforce them would prevent the reasonable use of property in the
way most beneficial to the community.</p>

<p class='c007'>So understanding the finding of the jury, I am of opinion the defendant
is not liable. What has the defendant done wrong? What
right of the plaintiff has she infringed? She has done nothing wrong,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>she has infringed no right. It is not the defendant who let loose the
water and sent it to destroy the bridges. She did indeed store it, and
store it in such quantities that, if it was let loose, it would do, as it
did, mischief. But suppose a stranger let it loose, would the defendant
be liable? If so, then if a mischievous boy bored a hole in a cistern
in any London house, and the water did mischief to a neighbor, the
occupier of the house would be liable. That cannot be. Then why is
the defendant liable if some agent over which she has no control lets
the water out? Mr. McIntyre contended that she would be in all cases
of the water being let out, whether by a stranger or the Queen’s enemies,
or by natural causes, as lightning or an earthquake. Why?
What is the difference between a reservoir and a stack of chimneys for
such a question as this? Here the defendant stored a lot of water for
her own purposes; in the case of the chimneys some one has put a ton
of bricks fifty feet high for his own purposes; both equally harmless
if they stay where placed, and equally mischievous if they do not. The
water is no more a wild or savage animal than the bricks while at rest,
nor more so when in motion: both have the same property of obeying
the law of gravitation. Could it be said that no one could have a stack
of chimneys except on the terms of being liable for any damage done
by their being overthrown by a hurricane or an earthquake? If so,
it would be dangerous to have a tree, for a wind might come so strong
as to blow it out of the ground into a neighbor’s land and cause it to
do damage; or a field of ripe wheat, which might be fired by lightning
and do mischief.</p>

<p class='c007'>I admit that it is not a question of negligence. A man may use all
care to keep the water in, or the stack of chimneys standing, but would
be liable if through any defect, though latent, the water escaped or
the bricks fell. But here the act is that of an agent he cannot control.</p>

<p class='c007'>This case differs wholly from Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands, L. R. 1 Ex. 265,
279. There the defendant poured the water into the plaintiff’s mine.
He did not know he was doing so; but he did it as much as though he
had poured it into an open channel which led to the mine without his
knowing it. Here the defendant merely brought it to a place whence
another agent let it loose. I am by no means sure that the likeness of
a wild animal is exact. I am by no means sure that if a man kept a
tiger, and lightning broke his chain, and he got loose and did mischief,
that the man who kept him would not be liable. But this case and the
case I put of the chimneys, are not cases of keeping a dangerous beast
for amusement, but of a reasonable use of property in a way beneficial
to the community. I think this analogy has made some of the difficulty
in this case. Water stored in a reservoir may be the only practical
mode of supplying a district and so adapting it for habitation.
I refer to my judgment [3 H. &amp; C. 788; 34 L. J. (Ex.) 181] in Fletcher
<em>v.</em> Rylands, and I repeat that here the plaintiff had no right that has
been infringed, and the defendant has done no wrong. The plaintiff’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>right is to say to the defendant, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic utere tuo ut alienum non lædas</span></i>, and
that the defendant has done, and no more.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <span class='sc'>Chief Baron</span> and my brother <span class='sc'>Cleasby</span> agree in this judgment.
As to the plaintiff’s application for a new trial on the ground
that the finding of the jury is against evidence, we have spoken to
Cockburn, C. J.; he is not dissatisfied therewith, and we cannot see
it is wrong. Consequently the rule will be absolute to enter a verdict
for the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Assuming the jury to be right in finding that the defendant was not
guilty of negligence, and that the rainfall amounted to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>, or
the act of God, still the defendant is liable because she has, without
necessity and voluntarily for her own pleasure, stored on her premises
an element which was liable to be let loose, and which, if let loose,
would be dangerous to her neighbors. Even if she be considered innocent
of wrong-doing, why should the plaintiff suffer for the defendant’s
voluntary act of turning an otherwise harmless stream into a
source of danger? But for the defendant’s embankments, the excessive
rainfall would have escaped without doing injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judgment of the Court (<span class='sc'>Cockburn, C. J.</span>, <span class='sc'>James</span>, and <span class='sc'>Mellish</span>,
L.JJ., and <span class='sc'>Baggallay, J. A.</span>) was read by</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mellish, L. J.</span> This was an action brought by the county surveyor
[under 43 Geo. 3, c. 59, s. 4] of the County of Chester against the defendant
to recover damages on account of the destruction of four
county bridges which had been carried away by the bursting of some
reservoirs. At the trial before Cockburn, C. J., it appeared that the
defendant was the owner of a series of artificial ornamental lakes,
which had existed for a great number of years, and had never, previous
to the 18th day of June, 1872, caused any damage. On that day, however,
after a most unusual fall of rain, the lakes overflowed, the dams
at their end gave way, and the water out of the lakes carried away the
county bridges lower down the stream. The jury found that there was
no negligence either in the construction or the maintenance of the
reservoirs, but that if the flood could have been anticipated, the effect
might have been prevented.<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c015'><sup>[290]</sup></a> Upon this finding the Lord Chief Justice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>acting on the decision in Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher, L. R. 3 H. L. 330,
as the nearest authority applicable to the case, directed a verdict for
the plaintiff, but gave leave to move to enter a verdict for the defendant.
The Court of Exchequer have ordered the verdict to be entered
for the defendant, and from their decision an appeal has been brought
before us.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appellant relied upon the decision in the case of Rylands <em>v.</em>
Fletcher, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>. In that case the rule of law on which the case was
decided was thus laid down by Mr. Justice Blackburn in the Exchequer
Chamber [L. R. 1 Ex. 279]: “We think the true rule of law is
that the person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects
and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must
keep it in at his peril, and if he does not do so, is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> answerable
for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape. He
can excuse himself by showing that the escape was owing to the plaintiff’s
default; or perhaps that the escape was the consequence of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis
major</span></i>, or the act of God; but as nothing of the sort exists here it is
unnecessary to inquire what excuse would be sufficient.” It appears
to us that we have two questions to consider: First, the question of
law, which was left undecided in Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,—Can
the defendant excuse herself by showing that the escape of the water
was owing to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>, or, as it is termed in the law books, the “act of
God?” And, secondly, if she can, did she in fact make out that the
escape was so occasioned?</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, with respect to the first question, the ordinary rule of law is
that when the law creates a duty and the party is disabled from performing
it without any default of his own, by the act of God, or the
King’s enemies, the law will excuse him; but when a party by his own
contract creates a duty, he is bound to make it good notwithstanding
any accident by inevitable necessity. We can see no good reason why
that rule should not be applied to the case before us. The duty of
keeping the water in and preventing its escape is a duty imposed by
the law, and not one created by contract. If, indeed, the making a
reservoir was a wrongful act in itself, it might be right to hold that a
person could not escape from the consequences of his own wrongful
act. But it seems to us absurd to hold that the making or the keeping
a reservoir is a wrongful act in itself. The wrongful act is not the making
or keeping the reservoir, but the allowing or causing the water to
escape. If, indeed, the damages were occasioned by the act of the
party without more—as where a man accumulates water on his own
land, but, owing to the peculiar nature or condition of the soil, the
water escapes and does damage to his neighbor—the case of Rylands
<em>v.</em> Fletcher, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, establishes that he must be held liable. The accumulation
of water in a reservoir is not in itself wrongful; but the
making it and suffering the water to escape, if damage ensue, constitute
a wrong. But the present case is distinguished from that of Rylands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span><em>v.</em> Fletcher, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, in this, that it is not the act of the defendant
in keeping this reservoir, an act in itself lawful, which alone leads to
the escape of the water, and so renders wrongful that which but for
such escape would have been lawful. It is the supervening <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>
of the water caused by the flood, which, superadded to the water in the
reservoir (which of itself would have been innocuous), causes the disaster.
A defendant cannot, in our opinion, be properly said to have
caused or allowed the water to escape, if the act of God or the Queen’s
enemies was the real cause of its escaping without any fault on the
part of the defendant. If a reservoir was destroyed by an earthquake,
or the Queen’s enemies destroyed it in conducting some warlike operation,
it would be contrary to all reason and justice to hold the owner
of the reservoir liable for any damage that might be done by the escape
of the water. We are of opinion, therefore, that the defendant was entitled
to excuse herself by proving that the water escaped through the
act of God.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remaining question is, did the defendant make out that the escape
of the water was owing to the act of God? Now the jury have
distinctly found, not only that there was no negligence in the construction
or the maintenance of the reservoirs, but that the flood was so
great that it could not reasonably have been anticipated, although, if
it had been anticipated, the effect might have been prevented; and
this seems to us in substance a finding that the escape of the water was
owing to the act of God. However great the flood had been, if it had
not been greater than floods that had happened before and might be
expected to occur again, the defendant might not have made out that
she was free from fault; but we think she ought not to be held liable
because she did not prevent the effect of an extraordinary act of
nature, which she could not anticipate. In the late case of Nugent <em>v.</em>
Smith, 1 C. P. D. 423, we held that a carrier might be protected from
liability for a loss occasioned by the act of God, if the loss by no reasonable
precaution could be prevented, although it was not absolutely
impossible to prevent it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was indeed ingeniously argued for the appellant that at any rate
the escape of the water was not owing solely to the act of God, because
the weight of the water originally in the reservoirs must have contributed
to break down the dams, as well as the extraordinary water
brought in by the flood. We think, however, that the extraordinary
quantity of water brought in by the flood is in point of law the sole
proximate cause of the escape of the water. It is the last drop which
makes the cup overflow.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the whole we are of opinion that the judgment of the Court of
Exchequer ought to be affirmed.</p>

of a reservoir of the defendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The defendants are the owners and occupiers of a woollen clothmill
situate at Batley, in the county of York, and for the necessary
supply of water to the mill is a reservoir, also belonging to the defendants.
Such mill and reservoir have been built, and constructed, and
used, as at the time of the overflowing of the reservoir hereinafter mentioned,
for many years.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The plaintiff is the tenant of premises adjoining the reservoir.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The reservoir is supplied with water from a main drain or watercourse.
The surplus water from the reservoir passes through an outlet
into the main drain or watercourse. The inlet and outlet are furnished
with proper doors or sluices, so as (when required) to close the communications
between the reservoir and the main drain or watercourse.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The whole of the premises are within the borough of Batley, and
the defendants have the right to use the main drain or watercourse by
obtaining a supply of water therefrom and discharging their surplus
water thereinto, as hereinbefore stated, but have otherwise no control
over the drain or watercourse, which does not belong to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. In the month of December, 1877, the plaintiff’s premises were
flooded by reason of the overflowing of the defendants’ reservoir.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Such overflowing was caused by the emptying of a large quantity
of water from a reservoir, the property of a third party, into the main
drain or watercourse at a point considerably above the defendants’
premises, and by an obstruction in the main drain or watercourse
below the outlet of the defendants’ reservoir, whereby the water from
such main drain or watercourse was forced through the doors or sluices
(which were closed at the time) into the defendants’ reservoir.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Such obstruction was caused by circumstances over which the
defendants had no control, and without their knowledge; and had it
not been for such obstruction the overflowing of the reservoir would
not have happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. The defendants’ reservoir, and the communications between it
and the main drain or watercourse, and the doors or sluices, are constructed
and maintained in a proper manner, so as to prevent the overflowing
of the reservoir under all ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. No negligence or wrongful act is attributable to either party.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the circumstances the judge of the County Court was of opinion
that the defendants were liable for the damage sustained by the
plaintiff, and accordingly gave judgment for the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>The question for the opinion of the Court, having regard to the
facts set out in the case, was whether the defendants were liable for
the damage sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the flooding of his
premises, such flooding being caused by water from a reservoir belonging
to a third party, over which the defendants had no control, and
without any knowledge or negligence on defendants’ part, the overflowing
of the defendants’ reservoir being occasioned by the act of a
third party, over whom the defendants had no control, and no wrongful
act or negligence being attributable to the defendants, and the
direct cause of the damage being the obstruction in the main drain or
watercourse, which was caused by circumstances over which the
defendants had no control and without their knowledge.<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c015'><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Kelly, C. B.</span> I think this judgment must be reversed. The case
states that for many years the defendants have been possessed of a
reservoir to which there are gates or sluices. There has been an overflow
from the reservoir which has caused damage to the plaintiff. The
question is, what was the cause of this overflow? Was it anything for
which the defendants are responsible—did it proceed from their act
or default, or from that of a stranger over which they had no control?
The case is abundantly clear on this, proving beyond a doubt that the
defendants had no control over the causes of the overflow, and no
knowledge of the existence of the obstruction. The matters complained
of took place through no default or breach of duty of the
defendants, but were caused by a stranger over whom and at a spot
where they had no control. It seems to me to be immaterial whether
this is called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i> or the unlawful act of a stranger; it is sufficient
to say that the defendants had no means of preventing the occurrence.
I think the defendants could not possibly have been expected to anticipate
that which happened here, and the law does not require them to
construct their reservoir and the sluices and gates leading to it to meet
any amount of pressure which the wrongful act of a third person may
impose. The judgment must be entered for the defendants.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pollock, B.</span> I also think the defendants are entitled to judgment.
Looking at the facts stated, that the defendants had no control over
the main drain, and no knowledge of or control over the obstruction,
apart from the cases, what wrong have the defendants done for which
they should be held liable? The case of Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher, L. R. 3
H. L. 330, is quite distinguishable. The case of Nichols <em>v.</em> Marsland,
L. R. 10 Ex. 255, 14 Eng. R. 538, is more in point. The illustrations
put in that case clearly go to show that if the person who has collected
the water has done all that skill and judgment can do he is not liable
for damage by acts over which he has no control. In the judgment of
the Court of Appeals, 2 Ex. D. 1, at p. 5, Mellish, L. J., adopts the
principle laid down by this Court. He says: “If indeed the damages
were occasioned by the act of the party without more—as where a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>man accumulates water on his own land, but owing to the peculiar
nature or condition of the soil the water escapes and does damage to
his neighbor—the case of Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, establishes
that he must be held liable.” Here this water has not been accumulated
by the defendants, but has come from elsewhere and added to
that which was properly and safely there. For this the defendants, in
my opinion, both on principle and authority, cannot be held liable.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>MARSHALL <em>v.</em> WELWOOD<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court of New Jersey, June Term, 1876.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 38 New Jersey Law Reports, 339.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Suit for damages done to the property of the plaintiff by the bursting
of the boiler of a steam-engine on the adjoining property of the
defendant Welwood. Garside, the other defendant, had sold this boiler
to Welwood, and was experimenting with it at the time of the explosion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case came before the Court on a motion for a new trial, the
verdict having gone for the plaintiff against both defendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Argued at February Term, 1876, before <span class='sc'>Beasley, C. J.</span>, and <span class='sc'>Woodhull</span>,
<span class='sc'>Van Syckel</span>, and <span class='sc'>Scudder</span>, JJ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Beasley, C. J.</span> The judge, at the trial of this cause, charged,
among other matters, that as the evidence incontestably showed that
one of the defendants, Welwood, was the owner of the boiler which
caused the damage, he was liable in the action, unless it appeared that
the same was not being run by him, or his agent, at the time of the
explosion. The proposition propounded was, that a person is responsible
for the immediate consequences of the bursting of a steam boiler,
in use by him, irrespective of any question as to negligence or want of
skill on his part.</p>

<p class='c007'>This view of the law is in accordance with the principles maintained,
with great learning and force of reasoning, in some of the late English
decisions. In this class the leading case was that of Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands,
L. R. 1 Exch. 265, which was a suit on account of damage done
by water escaping on to the premises of the plaintiff from a reservoir
which the defendant had constructed, with due care and skill, on his
own land. The judgment was put on a general ground, for the Court
said: “We think the true rule of law is, that the person who, for his
own purposes, brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything
likely to do mischief, if it escapes, must keep it in at his peril,
and if he does not do so, is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> answerable for all the damage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>which is the natural consequence of its escape.” This result was
deemed just, and was sought to be vindicated on the theory that it is
but reasonable that a person who has brought something on his own
property, which was not naturally there, harmless to others, so long as
it is confined to his own property, but which he knows to be mischievous,
if it gets on his neighbor’s, should be obliged to make good the
damage which ensues, if he does not succeed in confining it to his own
property. This principle would evidently apply to, and rule, the present
case: for water is no more likely to escape from a reservoir and do
damage, than steam is from a boiler; and, therefore, if he who collects
the former force upon his property, and seeks, with care and
skill, to keep it there, is answerable for his want of success, so is he
who, under similar conditions, endeavors to deal with the latter.
There is nothing unlawful in introducing water into a properly constructed
reservoir on a person’s own land, nor raising steam in a boiler
of proper quality; neither act, when performed, is a nuisance <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>;
and the inquiry consequently is, whether in the doing of such lawful
act the party who does it is an insurer against all flaws in the apparatus
employed, no matter how secret, or unascertainable by the use of
every reasonable test, such flaws may be. This English adjudication
takes the affirmative side of the question, conceding, however, that the
subject is not controlled by any express decision, and that it is to be investigated
with reference to the general grounds of jurisprudence. I
have said the doctrine involved has been learnedly treated, and the
decision is of great weight, and yet its reasoning has failed to convince
me of the correctness of the result to which it leads, and such result is
clearly opposed to the course which judicial opinion has taken in this
country. The fallacy in the process of argument by which judgment
is reached in this case of Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands, appears to me to consist
in this: that the rule mainly applicable to a class of cases which, I
think, should be regarded as, in a great degree, exceptional, is amplified
and extended into a general, if not universal, principle. The
principal instance upon which reliance is placed is the well-known
obligation of the owner of cattle, to prevent them from escaping from
his land and doing mischief. The law as to this point is perfectly
settled, and has been settled from the earliest times, and is to the effect
that the owner must take charge of his cattle at his peril, and if they
evade his custody he is, in some measure, responsible for the consequences.
This is the doctrine of the Year Books, but I do not find
that it is grounded in any theoretical principle, making a man answerable
for his acts or omissions, without regard to his culpability. That
in this particular case of escaping cattle so stringent an obligation
upon the owner should grow up, was not unnatural. That the beasts
of the landowner should be successfully restrained, was a condition of
considerable importance to the unmolested enjoyment of property,
and the right to plead that the escape had occurred by inevitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>accident would have seriously impaired, if it did not entirely frustrate,
the process of distress damage feasant. Custom has had much to do in
giving shape to the law, and what is highly convenient readily runs
into usage, and is accepted as a rule. It would but rarely occur that
cattle would escape from a vigilant owner, and in this instance such
rare exceptions seem to have passed unnoticed, for there appears to be
no example of the point having been presented for judicial consideration;
for the conclusion of the liability of the unnegligent owner rests
in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</span></i>, and not in express decision. But waiving this, there is a consideration
which seems to me to show that this obligation which is put
upon the owner of errant cattle should not be taken to be a principle
applicable, in a general way, to the use or ownership of property,
which is this: that the owner of such cattle is, after all, liable only <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub
modo</span></i> for the injury done by them, that is, he is responsible, with regard
to tame beasts who have no exceptionally vicious disposition so far as
is known, for the grass they eat, and such like injuries, but not for the
hurt they may inflict upon the person of others,—a restriction on
liability which is hardly consistent with the notion that this class of
cases proceeds from a principle so wide as to embrace all persons whose
lawful acts produce, without fault in them, and in an indirect manner,
ill results which disastrously affect innocent persons. If the principle
ruling these cases was so broad as this, conformity to it would require
that the person being the cause of the mischief should stand as an indemnifier
against the whole of the damage. It appears to me, therefore,
that this rule, which applies to damage done by straying cattle,
was carried beyond its true bounds, when it was appealed to [in] proof
that a person in law is answerable for the natural consequences of his
acts, such acts being lawful in themselves, and having been done with
proper care and skill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only other cases which were referred to in support of the judgment
under consideration were those of one who was sued for not
keeping the wall of his privy in repair, to the detriment of his neighbor,
being the case of Tenant <em>v.</em> Goulding, 1 Salk. 21, and several
actions which it is said had been brought against the owners of some
alkali works for damages alleged to have been caused by the chlorine
fumes escaping from their works [which], the case showed, had been
erected upon the best scientific principles. But I am compelled to
think that these cases are but a slender basis for the large structure
put upon it. The case of Tenant <em>v.</em> Goulding presented merely the
question whether a landowner is bound in favor of his neighbor to
keep the wall of his privy in repair, and the Court held that he was,
and that he was responsible if, for want of such reparation, the filth
escaped on the adjoining land. No question was mooted as to his
liability in case the privy had been constructed with care and skill
with a view to prevent the escape of its contents, and had been kept
in a state of repair. Not to repair a receptacle of this kind when it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>in want of repairs was, in itself, a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> case of negligence, and
it seems to me that all the Court decided was to hold so.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this consideration is also to be noticed, both with respect to this
last case, and that of the injurious fumes from the alkali works, that
in truth they stand somewhat by themselves, and having this peculiarity:
that the things in their nature partake largely of the character of
nuisances. Take the alkali works as an example. Placed in a town,
under ordinary circumstances, they would be a nuisance. When the
attempt is made by scientific methods to prevent the escape of the
fumes, it is an attempt to legalize that which is illegal, and the consequence
is, it may well be held that, failing in the attempt, the
nuisance remains.</p>

<p class='c007'>I cannot agree that, from these indications, the broad doctrine is to
be drawn that a man in law is an insurer that the acts which he does,
such acts being lawful and done with care, shall not injuriously affect
others. The decisions cited are not so much examples of legal maxims
as of exceptions to such maxims; for they stand opposed, and in contrast
to principles, which it seems to me must be considered much more
general in their operation and elementary in their nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The common rule, quite institutional in its character, is that, in
order to sustain an action for a tort, the damage complained of must
have come from a wrongful act. Mr. Addison, in his work on Torts,
Vol. I, p. 3, very correctly states this rule. He says: “A man may,
however, sustain grievous damage at the hands of another, and yet, if
it be the result of inevitable accident, or a lawful act, done in a lawful
manner, without any carelessness or negligence, there is no legal injury,
and no tort giving rise to an action of damages.” Among other
examples, he refers to an act of force, done in necessary self-defence,
causing injury to an innocent bystander, which he characterizes as
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum sine injuria</span></i>,—“for no man does wrong or contracts guilt in
defending himself against an aggressor.” Other instances of a like
kind are noted, such as the lawful obstruction of the view from the
windows of dwelling-houses; or the turning aside, to the detriment of
another, the current of the sea or river, by means of walls or dikes.
Many illustrations, of the same bearing, are to be found scattered
through the books of reports. Thus, Dyer, 25 b, says: “That if a
man have a dog which has killed sheep, the master of the dog being
ignorant of such quality and property of the dog, the master shall not
be punished for that killing.” This case belongs to a numerous, well-known
class, where animals which are usually harmless do damage, the
decisions being that, under such conditions, the owners of the animals
are not responsible. Akin to these in principle are cases of injuries
done to innocent persons by horses in the charge of their owners, becoming
ungovernable by reason of unexpected causes; or where a
person in a dock was struck by the falling of a bale of cotton which the
defendants’ servants were lowering, Scott <em>v.</em> London Dock Co., 3 H. &amp;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>C. 596; or in cases of collision, either on land or sea. Hammack <em>v.</em>
White, 11 C. B. n. s. 588.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that these cases of injury done to personal property, or to
persons, are, in the case of Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands, sought to be distinguished
from other damages, on the ground that they are done in the
course of traffic on the highways, whether by land or sea, which cannot
be conducted without exposing those whose persons or property are
near it to some inevitable risk. But this explanation is not sufficiently
comprehensive, for, if a frightened horse should, in his flight, break
into an inclosure, no matter how far removed from the highway, the
owner would not be answerable for the damage done. Nor is the reason
upon which it rests satisfactory, for, if traffic cannot be carried on
without some risk, why can it not be said with the same truth, that the
other affairs of life, though they be transacted away from the highways,
cannot be carried on without some risk; and if such risk is, in
the one case, to be borne by innocent persons, why not in the other?
Business done upon private property may be a part of traffic as well as
that done by the means of the highway, and no reason is perceived why
the same favor is not to be extended to it in both situations. But,
besides this, the reason thus assigned for the immunity of him who is
the unwilling producer of the damage has not been the ground on
which the decisions illustrative of the rule have been put; that ground
has been that the person sought to be charged had not done any unlawful
act. Everywhere, in all the branches of the law, the general
principle that blame must be imputable as a ground of responsibility
for damage proceeding from a lawful act, is apparent. A passenger is
injured by the breaking of an axle of a public conveyance; the carrier
is not liable, unless negligence can be shown. A man’s guest is hurt by
the falling of a chandelier; a suit will not lie against the host, without
proof that he knew, or ought to have known of the existence of the
danger. If the steam-engine which did the mischief in the present
case had been in use in driving a train of cars on a railroad, and had,
in that situation, exploded, and had inflicted injuries on travellers or
by-standers, it could not have been pretended that such damage was
actionable, in the absence of the element of negligence or unskilfulness.
By changing the place of the accident to private property, I
cannot agree that a different rule obtains.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems to me, therefore, that in this case it was necessary to submit
the matter, as a question of fact for the jury, whether the occurrence
doing the damage complained of, was the product of pure
accident, or the result of want of care or skill on the part of the defendant
or his agents.</p>

<p class='c007'>This view of the subject is taken in the American decisions. A
case, in all respects in point, is that of Losee <em>v.</em> Buchanan, 51 N. Y.
476; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span> 10 Am. Rep. 623. The facts were essentially the same
with those of the principal case. It was an action growing out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>the explosion of a steam boiler upon private property, and the ruling
was that such action could not be sustained without proof of fault or
negligence. In that report the line of cases is so fully set out that it
is unnecessary here to repeat them.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>BROWN <em>v.</em> COLLINS<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New Hampshire, June, 1873.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 53 New Hampshire Reports, 442.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Trespass, by Albert H. Brown against Lester Collins, to recover
the value of a stone post on which was a street lamp, situated in front
of his place of business in the village of Tilton. The post stood upon
the plaintiff’s land, but near the southerly line of the main highway
leading through the village and within four feet of said line. There
was nothing to indicate the line of the highway, nor any fence or
other obstruction between the highway, as travelled, and the post.
The highway crosses the railroad near the place of accident, and the
stone post stood about fifty feet from the railroad track at the crossing.
The defendant was in the highway, at or near the railroad crossing,
with a pair of horses loaded with grain, going to the grist-mill in Tilton
village. The horses became frightened by an engine on the railroad
near the crossing, and by reason thereof became unmanageable,
and ran, striking the post with the end of the pole and breaking it off
near the ground, destroying the lamp with the post. No other injury
was done by the accident. The shock produced by the collision with
the post threw the defendant from his seat in the wagon, and he struck
on the ground between the horses, but suffered no injury except a
slight concussion. The defendant was in the use of ordinary care and
skill in managing his team, until they became frightened as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The foregoing facts were agreed upon for the purpose of raising the
question of the right of the plaintiff to recover in this action.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span><span class='sc'>Doe, J.</span> It is agreed that the defendant was in the use of ordinary
care and skill in managing his horses, until they were frightened; and
that they then became unmanageable, and ran against and broke a
post on the plaintiff’s land. It is not explicitly stated that the defendant
was without actual fault,—that he was not guilty of any malice,
or unreasonable unskilfulness or negligence; but it is to be inferred
that the fact was so; and we decide the case on that ground. We
take the case as one where, without actual fault in the defendant, his
horses broke from his control, ran away with him, went upon the
plaintiff’s land, and did damage there, against the will, intent, and
desire of the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Thomas Raymond’s report of Lambert &amp; Olliot <em>v.</em> Bessey, T.
Raym. 421, and Bessey <em>v.</em> Olliot &amp; Lambert, T. Raym. 467, is, “The
question was this: A gaoler takes from the bailiff a prisoner arrested
by him out of the bailiff’s jurisdiction, Whether the gaoler be liable
to an action of false imprisonment? and the judges of the common
pleas did all hold that he was; and of that opinion I am, for these
reasons.</p>

of the actor, as the loss and damage of the party suffering; and therefore

acres, and upon it a hedge of thorns, and he cut the thorns, and they,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso invito</span></i>, fell upon the plaintiff’s land, and the defendant took them
off as soon as he could, which is the same trespass; and the plaintiff
demurred; and adjudged for the plaintiff; for though a man doth a
lawful thing, yet if any damage do thereby befall another, he shall
answer for it if he could have avoided it. As if a man lop a tree, and
the boughs fall upon another, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso invito</span></i>, yet an action lies. If a man
shoot at butts, and hurt another unawares, an action lies. I have land
through which a river runs to your mill, and I lop the fallows growing
upon the river side, which accidentally stop the water, so as your mill
is hindered, an action lies. If I am building my own house, and a
piece of timber falls on my neighbor’s house, and breaks part of it,
an action lies. If a man assault me, and I lift up my staff to defend
myself, and, in lifting it up, hit another, an action lies by that person,
and yet I did a lawful thing. And the reason of all these cases is, because
he that is damaged ought to be recompensed. But otherwise it
is in criminal cases, for there <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea</span></i>.</p>

and make satisfaction to the plaintiff.</p>

no good plea. So here, though the defendant knew not of the wrongful
taking of the plaintiff, yet that will not make any recompense for
the wrong the plaintiff hath sustained.... But the three other

<p class='c007'>In Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands,<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c015'><sup>[295]</sup></a> L. R. 3 H. L. 330, Lord Cranworth said:
“In considering whether a defendant is liable to a plaintiff for damage
which the plaintiff may have sustained, the question in general is
not whether the defendant has acted with due care and caution, but
whether his acts have occasioned the damage. This is all well explained
in the old case of Lambert <em>v.</em> Bessey, reported by Sir Thomas
Raymond (Sir T. Raym. 421). And the doctrine is founded on good
sense. For when one person, in managing his own affairs, causes, however
innocently, damage to another, it is obviously only just that he
should be the party to suffer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The head-note of Weaver <em>v.</em> Ward. Hob. 134, is: “If one trained
soldier wound another, in skirmishing for exercise, an action of trespass
will lie, unless it shall appear from the defendant’s plea that he
was guilty of no negligence, and that the injury was inevitable.” The
reason of the decision, as reported, was this: “For though it were
agreed, that if men tilt or tourney in the presence of the king, or if
two masters of defence playing their prizes kill one another, that this
shall be no felony; or if a lunatic kill a man, or the like; because
felony must be done <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">animo felonico</span></i>; yet in trespass, which tends only
to give damages according to hurt or loss, it is not so; and therefore
if a lunatic hurt a man, he shall be answerable in trespass; and therefore
no man shall be excused of a trespass (for this is the nature of
an excuse, and not of a justification, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prout ei bene licuit</span></i>), except it
may be judged utterly without his fault; as if a man by force take
my hand and strike you; or if here the defendant had said that the
plaintiff ran across his piece when it was discharging; or had set forth
the case with the circumstances, so as it had appeared to the Court
that it had been inevitable, and that the defendant had committed no
negligence to give occasion to the hurt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There may be some ground to argue that “utterly without his
fault,” “inevitable,” and “no negligence,” in the sense intended, in
that case, mean no more than the modern phrase “ordinary and reasonable
care and prudence;” and that, in such a case, at the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>time, to hold a plea good that alleges the exercise of reasonable care,
without setting forth all “the circumstances” or evidence sustaining
the plea, would be substantially in compliance with the law of that
case, due allowance being made for the difference of legal language
used at different periods, and the difference in the forms of pleading.
But the drift of the ancient English authorities on the law of torts
seems to differ materially from the view now prevailing in this country.
Formerly, in England, there seems to have been no well-defined
test of an actionable tort. Defendants were often held liable
“because,” as Raymond says, “he that is damaged ought to be recompensed;”
and not because, upon some clearly stated principle of
law founded on actual culpability, public policy, or natural justice, he
was entitled to compensation from the defendant. The law was supposed
to regard “the loss and damage of the party suffering,” more
than the negligence and blameworthiness of the defendant: but how
much more it regarded the former than the latter, was a question not
settled, and very little investigated. “The loss and damage of the
party suffering,” if without relief, would be a hardship to him; relief
compulsorily furnished by the other party would often be a hardship
to him; when and why the “loss and damage” should, and when and
why they should not, be transferred from one to the other, by process
of law, were problems not solved in a philosophical manner. There
were precedents, established upon superficial, crude, and undigested
notions; but no application of the general system of legal reason to
this subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Holmes says: “It may safely be stated that all the more ancient
examples are traceable to conceptions of a much ruder sort (than
actual fault), and in modern times to more or less definitely thought-out
views of public policy. The old writs in trespass did not allege,
nor was it necessary to show, anything savoring of culpability. It
was enough that a certain event had happened, and it was not even
necessary that the act should be done intentionally, though innocently.
An accidental blow was as good a cause of action as an
intentional one. On the other hand, when, as in Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher,
modern courts hold a man liable for the escape of water from a reservoir
which he has built upon his land, or for the escape of cattle,
although he is not alleged to have been negligent, they do not proceed
upon the ground that there is an element of culpability in making such
a reservoir, or in keeping cattle, sufficient to charge the defendant as
soon as a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum</span></i> occurs, but on the principle that it is politic to
make those who go into extra-hazardous employments take the risk
on their own shoulders.” He alludes to the fact that “there is no
certainty what will be thought extra-hazardous in a certain jurisdiction
at a certain time,” but suggests that many particular instances
point to the general principle of liability for the consequences of extra-hazardous
undertakings as the tacitly assumed ground of decision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>7 Am. Law Rev. 652, 653, 662; 2 Kent Com. (12th ed.) 561, <em>n.</em> 1; 4 <em>id.</em>
110, n. 1. If the hazardous nature of things or of acts is adopted as the
test, or one of the tests, and the English authorities are taken as the
standard of what is to be regarded as hazardous, “it will be necessary
to go the length of saying that an owner of real property is liable for
all damage resulting to his neighbor’s property from anything done
upon his own land” (Mellish’s argument in Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands, L. R.
1 Ex. 272), and that an individual is answerable “who, for his own
benefit, makes an improvement on his own land, according to his best
skill and diligence, and not foreseeing it will produce any injury to his
neighbor, if he thereby unwittingly injure his neighbor”—Gibbs,
C. J., in Sutton <em>v.</em> Clarke, 6 Taunt. 44, approved by Blackburn, J., in
Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands, L. R. 1 Ex. 286. If danger is adopted as a test,
and the English authorities are abandoned, the fact of danger, controverted
in each case, will present a question for the jury, and expand
the issue of tort or no tort into a question of reasonableness, in a form
much broader than has been generally used; or courts will be left to
devise tests of peril, under varying influences of time and place that
may not immediately produce a uniform, consistent, and permanent
rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would seem that some of the early English decisions were based
on a view as narrow as that which regards nothing but the hardship
“of the party suffering;” disregards the question whether, by transferring
the hardship to the other party, anything more will be done
than substitute one suffering party for another; and does not consider
what legal reason can be given for relieving the party who has suffered,
by making another suffer the expense of his relief. For some of those
decisions, better reasons may now be given than were thought of when
the decisions were announced: but whether a satisfactory test of an
actionable tort can be extracted from the ancient authorities, and
whether the few modern cases that carry out the doctrine of those
authorities as far as it is carried in Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands (3 H. &amp; C.
774; L. R. 1 Ex. 265; L. R. 3 H. L. 330) can be sustained, is very
doubtful. The current of American authority is very strongly against
some of the leading English cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the strongest presentations of the extreme English view is
by Blackburn, J., who says, in Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands, L. R. 1 Ex. 279,
280, 281, 282: “We think that the true rule of law is, that the person
who for his own purposes brings on his lands, and collects and
keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it
in at his peril, and if he does not do so, is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> answerable for
all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape. He can
excuse himself by showing that the escape was owing to the plaintiff’s
default; or perhaps that the escape was the consequence of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis major</span></i>,
or the act of God; but as nothing of this sort exists here, it is unnecessary
to inquire what excuse would be sufficient. The general rule,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>as above stated, seems, on principle, just. The person whose grass or
corn is eaten down by the escaping cattle of his neighbor, or whose
mine is flooded by the water from his neighbor’s reservoir, or whose
cellar is invaded by the filth of his neighbor’s privy, or whose habitation
is made unhealthy by the fumes and noisome vapors of his neighbor’s
alkali works, is damnified without any fault of his own; and it
seems but reasonable and just that the neighbor, who has brought
something on his own property which was not naturally there, harmless
to others so long as it is confined to his own property, but which
he knows to be mischievous if it gets on his neighbor’s, should be
obliged to make good the damage which ensues if he does not succeed
in confining it to his own property. But for his act in bringing it
there no mischief could have accrued, and it seems but just that he
should, at his peril, keep it there so that no mischief may accrue, or
answer for the natural and anticipated consequences. And upon authority,
this we think is established to be the law, whether the things
so brought be beasts, or water, or filth, or stenches. The case that has
most commonly occurred, and which is most frequently to be found in
the books, is as to the obligation of the owner of cattle which he has
brought on his land, to prevent their escaping and doing mischief.
The law, as to them, seems to be perfectly settled from early times:
the owner must keep them in at his peril, or he will be answerable for
the natural consequences of their escape,—that is, with regard to
tame beasts, for the grass they eat and trample upon, though not for
any injury to the person of others, for our ancestors have settled that
it is not the general nature of horses to kick, or bulls to gore [or he
might have added, dogs to bite],—but if the owner knows that the
beast has a vicious propensity to attack man, he will be answerable for
that too.... In these latter authorities [relating to animals called
mischievous or ferocious], the point under consideration was damage
to the person; and what was decided was, that where it was known
that hurt to the person was the natural consequence of the animal
being loose, the owner should be responsible in damages for such hurt
though where it was not known to be so, the owner was not responsible
for such damages; but where the damage is, like eating grass or
other ordinary ingredients in damage feasant, the natural consequence
of the escape, the rule as to keeping in the animal is the same....
There does not appear to be any difference, in principle, between the
extent of the duty cast on him who brings cattle on his land to keep
them in, and the extent of the duty imposed on him who brings on his
land water, filth, or stenches, or any other thing, which will, if it
escape, naturally do damage, to prevent their escaping and injuring
his neighbor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This seems to be substantially an adoption of the early authorities,
and an extension of the ancient practice of holding the defendant
liable, in some cases, on the partial view that regarded the misfortune
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>of the plaintiff upon whom a damage had fallen, and required no legal
reason for transferring the damage to the defendant. The ancient
rule was, that a person in whose house, or on whose land, a fire accidentally
originated, which spread to his neighbor’s property and destroyed
it, must make good the loss. Filliter <em>v.</em> Phippard, 11 A. &amp; E.
<span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 347, 354; Tubervil <em>v.</em> Stamp, 1 Comyns, 32; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span> 1 Salk. 13;
Com. Dig., Action upon the case for Negligence (A 6); 1 Arch. N. P.
539; Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands, 3 H. &amp; C. 790, 793; Russell <em>v.</em> Fabyan, 34
N. H. 218, 225. No inquiry was made into the reason of putting upon
him his neighbor’s loss as well as his own. The rule of such cases is
applied, by Blackburn, to everything which a man brings on his land,
which will, if it escape, naturally do damage. One result of such a
doctrine is, that every one building a fire on his own hearth, for necessary
purposes, with the utmost care, does so at the peril, not only of
losing his own house, but of being irretrievably ruined if a spark from
his chimney starts a conflagration which lays waste the neighborhood.
“In conflict with the rule, as laid down in the English cases, is a
class of cases in reference to damage from fire communicated from
the adjoining premises. Fire, like water or steam, is likely to produce
mischief if it escapes and goes beyond control; and yet it has never
been held in this country that one building a fire upon his own premises
can be made liable if it escapes upon his neighbor’s premises, and
does him damage without proof of negligence.” Losee <em>v.</em> Buchanan,
51 N. Y. 476, 487.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everything that a man can bring on his land is capable of escaping,—against
his will, and without his fault, with or without assistance,
in some form, solid, liquid, or gaseous, changed or unchanged by the
transforming processes of nature or art,—and of doing damage after
its escape. Moreover, if there is a legal principle that makes a man
liable for the natural consequences of the escape of things which he
brings on his land, the application of such a principle cannot be limited
to those things; it must be applied to all his acts that disturb the
original order of creation; or, at least, to all things which he undertakes
to possess or control anywhere, and which were not used and enjoyed
in what is called the natural or primitive condition of mankind,
whatever that may have been. This is going back a long way for a
standard of legal rights, and adopting an arbitrary test of responsibility
that confounds all degrees of danger, pays no heed to the essential
elements of actual fault, puts a clog upon natural and reasonably
necessary uses of matter, and tends to embarrass and obstruct much
of the work which it seems to be man’s duty carefully to do. The
distinction made by Lord Cairns, Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher, L. R. 3 H. L.
330, between a natural and a non-natural use of land, if he meant
anything more than the difference between a reasonable use and an
unreasonable one, is not established in the law. Even if the arbitrary
test were applied only to things which a man brings on his land, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>would still recognize the peculiar rights of savage life in a wilderness,
ignore the rights growing out of a civilized state of society, and make
a distinction not warranted by the enlightened spirit of the common
law: it would impose a penalty upon efforts, made in a reasonable,
skilful, and careful manner, to rise above a condition of barbarism.
It is impossible that legal principle can throw so serious an obstacle in
the way of progress and improvement. Natural rights are, in general,
legal rights; and the rights of civilization are, in a legal sense, as
natural as any others. “Most of the rights of property, as well as of
person, in the social state, are not absolute but relative,” Losee <em>v.</em>
Buchanan, 51 N. Y. 485; and, if men ever were in any other than the
social state, it is neither necessary nor expedient that they should now
govern themselves on the theory that they ought to live in some other
state. The common law does not usually establish tests of responsibility
on any other basis than the propriety of their living in the
social state, and the relative and qualified character of the rights incident
to that state.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Fletcher <em>v.</em> Rylands, L. R. 1 Ex. 286, 287, Mr. Justice Blackburn,
commenting upon the remark of Mr. Baron Martin, “that,
when damage is done to personal property, or even to the person, by
collision, either upon land or at sea, there must be negligence in the
party doing the damage to render him legally responsible,” says,—“This
is no doubt true; and, as was pointed out by Mr. Mellish during
his argument before us, this is not confined to cases of collision, for
there are many cases in which proof of negligence is essential, as, for
instance, where an unruly horse gets on the footpath of a public street
and kills a passenger, Hammack <em>v.</em> White, 11 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 588, 31 L. J.
(C. P.) 129; or where a person in a dock is struck by the falling of
a bale of cotton which the defendant’s servants are lowering, Scott <em>v.</em>
London Docks Company, 3 H. &amp; C. 596, 35 L. J. (Ex.) 17, 220; and
many other similar cases may be found. But we think these cases distinguishable
from the present. Traffic on the highways, whether by
land or sea, cannot be conducted without exposing those whose persons
or property are near it to some inevitable risk; and that being
so, those who go on the highway, or have their property adjacent to it,
may well be held to do so subject to their taking upon themselves the
risk of injury from that inevitable danger; and persons who, by the
license of the owner, pass near to warehouses where goods are being
raised or lowered, certainly do so subject to the inevitable risk of accident.
In neither case, therefore, can they recover without proof of
want of care or skill occasioning the accident; and it is believed that
all the cases in which inevitable accident has been held an excuse for
what, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i>, was a trespass, can be explained on the same principle,
viz., that the circumstances were such as to show that the plaintiff
had taken that risk upon himself.” This would be authority for
holding, in the present case, that the plaintiff, by having his post near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>the street, took upon himself the risk of its being broken by an inevitable
accident carrying a traveller off the street. But such a doctrine
would open more questions, and more difficult ones, than it would
settle. At what distance from a highway would an object be near it?
What part of London is not near a street? And then, as the defendant
had as good a right to be at home with his horses as to be in the highway,
why might not his neighbor, by electing to live in an inhabited
country, as well be held to take upon himself the risk of an inevitable
accident happening by reason of the country being inhabited, as to
assume a highway risk by living near a road? If neighborhood is the
test, who are a man’s neighbors but the whole human race? If a person,
by remaining in England, is held to take upon himself one class
of the inevitable dangers of that country because he could avoid that
class by migrating to a region of solitude, why should he not, for a
like reason, also be held to expose himself voluntarily to other classes
of the inevitable dangers of that country? And where does this reasoning
end?</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not improbable that the rules of liability for damage done by
brutes or by fire, found in the early English cases, were introduced by
sacerdotal influence, from what was supposed to be the Roman or the
Hebrew law. 7 Am. L. Rev. 652, note; 1 Domat Civil Law (Strahan’s
translation, 2d ed.), 304, 305, 306, 312, 313; Exodus xxi 28–32, 36;
xxii. 5, 6, 9. It would not be singular if these rules should be spontaneously
produced at a certain period in the life of any community.
Where they first appeared is of little consequence in the present inquiry.
They were certainly introduced in England at an immature
stage of English jurisprudence, and an undeveloped state of agriculture,
manufactures, and commerce, when the nation had not settled
down to those modern, progressive, industrial pursuits which the spirit
of the common law, adapted to all conditions of society, encourages
and defends. They were introduced when the development of many
of the rational rules now universally recognized as principles of the
common law had not been demanded by the growth of intelligence,
trade, and productive enterprise,—when the common law had not
been set forth in the precedents, as a coherent and logical system on
many subjects other than the tenures of real estate. At all events,
whatever may be said of the origin of those rules, to extend them, as
they were extended in Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher, seems to us contrary to
the analogies and the general principles of the common law, as now
established. To extend them to the present case would be contrary to
American authority as well as to our understanding of legal principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulty under which the plaintiff might labor in proving the
culpability of the defendant,—which is sometimes given as a reason
for imposing an absolute liability without evidence of negligence,—Rixford
<em>v.</em> Smith, 52 N. H. 355, 359, or changing the burden of proof,
Lisbon <em>v.</em> Lyman, 49 N. H. 553, 568, 569, 574, 575, seems not to have
been given in the English cases relating to damage done by brutes or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>fire. And, however large or small the class of cases in which such
a difficulty may be the foundation of a rule of law, since the difficulty
has been so much reduced by the abolition of witness disabilities, the
present case is not one of that class.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many cases where a man is held liable for taking, converting
(C. R. Co. <em>v.</em> Foster, 51 N. H. 490) or destroying property,
or doing something else, or causing it to be done, intentionally, under
a claim of right, and without any actual fault. “Probably one half
of the cases in which trespass <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de bonis asportatis</span></i> is maintained, arise
from a mere misapprehension of legal rights.” Metcalf, J., in Stanley
<em>v.</em> Gaylord, 1 Cush. 536, 551. When a defendant erroneously supposed,
without any fault of either party, that he had a right to do
what he did, and his act, done in the assertion of his supposed right,
turns out to have been an interference with the plaintiff’s property, he
is generally held to have assumed the risk of maintaining the right
which he asserted, and the responsibility of the natural consequences
of his voluntary act. But when there was no fault on his part, and
the damage was not caused by his voluntary and intended act; or by
an act of which he knew, or ought to have known, the damage would
be a necessary, probable, or natural consequence; or by an act which
he knew or ought to have known, to be unlawful,—we understand
the general rule to be, that he is not liable. Vincent <em>v.</em> Stinehour, 7
Vt. 62; Aaron <em>v.</em> State, 31 Ga. 167; Morris <em>v.</em> Platt, 32 Conn. 75;
and Judge Redfield’s note to that case in 4 Am. L. Reg. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 532;
Townshend on Slander, secs. 67, 88, p. 128, n. 1 (2d ed.). In Brown
<em>v.</em> Kendall, 6 Cush. 292, the defendant, having interfered to part his
dog and the plaintiff’s which were fighting, in raising a stick for that
purpose accidentally struck the plaintiff, and injured him. It was
held, that parting the dogs was a lawful and proper act which the defendant
might do by the use of proper and safe means; and that if
the plaintiff’s injury was caused by such an act done with due care
and all proper precautions, the defendant was not liable. In the decision,
there is the important suggestion that some of the apparent
confusion in the authorities has arisen from discussions of the question
whether a party’s remedy is in trespass or case, and from the
statement that when the injury comes from a direct act, trespass lies,
and when the damage is consequential, case is the proper form of action,—the
remark concerning the immediate effect of an act being
made with reference to damage for which it is admitted there is a
remedy of some kind, and on the question of the proper remedy, not
on the general question of liability. Judge Shaw, delivering the opinion
of the court, said: “We think, as the result of all the authorities,
the rule is correctly stated by Mr. Greenleaf, that the plaintiff must
come prepared with evidence to show either that the <em>intention</em> was
unlawful, or that the defendant was <em>in fault</em>; for if the injury was
unavoidable, and the conduct of the defendant was free from blame,
he will not be liable. 2 Greenl. Ev., secs. 85 to 92; Wakeman <em>v.</em> Robinson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>1 Bing. 213. If, in the prosecution of a lawful act, a casualty
purely accidental arises, no action can be supported for an injury arising
therefrom. Davis <em>v.</em> Saunders, 2 Chit. R. 639; Com. Dig. Battery,
A. (Day’s ed.) and notes; Vincent <em>v.</em> Stinehour, 7 Vt. 62;”
James <em>v.</em> Campbell, 5 C. &amp; P. 372; Alderson <em>v.</em> Waistell, 1 C. &amp; K. 358.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever may be the rule or the exception, or the reason of it, in

inevitable danger, and unavoidable accident, the occurrence complained
of in this case was one for which the defendant is not liable,
unless every one is liable for all damage done by superior force overpowering
him, and using him or his property as an instrument of
violence. The defendant, being without fault, was as innocent as if
the pole of his wagon had been hurled on the plaintiff’s land by a
whirlwind, or he himself, by a stronger man, had been thrown through
the plaintiff’s window. Upon the facts stated, taken in the sense in
which we understand them, the defendant is entitled to judgment.

<p class='c014'>Appeal from Buchanan Circuit Court.</p>

<p class='c007'>Action for damages for the flooding of plaintiff’s cellar with water
caused by defendant’s negligence, whereby a large quantity of its
goods stored in the cellar were damaged. Answer, a general denial.<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c015'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant company supplied water distributed through pipes and
mains from reservoirs. A service pipe from a main carried water to
a building occupied by one August. There was a bursting in a “fish
trap” used in connection with the service pipe. Water escaped on to
the premises of August, and from thence to the adjoining premises of
the plaintiff company. The jury found a verdict for the defendant.
In view of the instructions given, this verdict must be regarded as
negativing the allegations of negligence contained in the plaintiff’s
pleading.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judgment having been rendered for defendant, the plaintiff appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Arguments and part of opinion omitted.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span><span class='sc'>Valliant, J.</span>... III. The plaintiff contends, however, that the
defendants are liable regardless of whether they were guilty of any
negligence directly causing the accident. This contention rests in the
theory that one who brings into his premises anything that is liable
to escape, and liable to inflict injury on his neighbors if it should
escape, brings it there at his peril, and is responsible for any injury
that it may cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>That contention rests for its authority on the decision in Rylands
<em>v.</em> Fletcher, L. R. 3 H. L. 330. In the briefs of the learned counsel
for respondents, reference is made to a large number of authorities
going to show that the doctrine of Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher has not been
approved generally in America, and that it has been modified in England.
Among the authorities so referred to are Griffith <em>v.</em> Lewis, 17
Mo. App. 605; Murphy <em>v.</em> Gillum, 73 Mo. App. 487; Cooley on Torts,
570; Losee <em>v.</em> Buchanan, 51 N. Y. 476; Brown <em>v.</em> Collins, 53 N. H.
442.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in the facts, the case at bar is distinguished from Rylands <em>v.</em>
Fletcher.</p>

<p class='c007'>[After stating the facts of Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher, and quoting from
the opinion of Lord Chancellor <span class='sc'>Cairns</span>.] There is a wide difference
between a great volume of water collected in a reservoir in dangerous
proximity to the premises of another and water brought into a house
through pipes in the manner usual in all cities, for the ordinary use
of the occupants of the house. Whilst water so brought into a house
cannot literally be said to have come in in the course of what might be
called in the language above quoted of the Lord Chancellor “natural
user” of the premises, yet it is brought in by the method universally
in use in cities and is not to be treated as an unnatural gathering of
a dangerous agent. The law applicable to the caging of ferocious animals
is not applicable to water brought into a house by pipes in the
usual manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned counsel for the plaintiff tried their case on the theory
that the defendants were negligent, and that is the only theory on
which they could have tried it.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>GILES <em>v.</em> WALKER<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Queen’s Bench Division, March 27, 1890.</span><br /> <em>Reported in Law Reports, 24 Queen’s Bench Division, 656.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Appeal from the Leicester County Court.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant, a farmer, occupied land which had originally been
forest land, but which had some years prior to 1883, when the defendant’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>occupation of it commenced, been brought into cultivation
by the then occupier. The forest land prior to cultivation did not
bear thistles; but immediately upon its being cultivated thistles
sprang up all over it. The defendant neglected to mow the thistles
periodically so as to prevent them from seeding, and in the years 1887
and 1888 there were thousands of thistles on his land in full seed. The
consequence was that the thistle seeds were blown by the wind in
large quantities on to the adjoining land of the plaintiff, where they
took root and did damage. The plaintiff sued the defendant for such
damage in the county court. The judge left to the jury the question
whether the defendant in not cutting the thistles had been guilty of
negligence. The jury found that he was negligent, and judgment was
accordingly entered for the plaintiff. The defendant appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Toller</em>, for the defendant. The facts of this case do not establish
any cause of action. The judge was wrong in leaving the question
of negligence to the jury. Before a person can be charged with negligence,
it must be shown that there is a duty on him to take care. But
here there is no such duty. The defendant did not bring the thistles
on to his land; they grew there naturally. [He was stopped by the
court.]</p>

<p class='c007'><em>R. Bray</em>, for the plaintiff. If the defendant’s predecessor had left
the land in its original condition as forest land the thistles would
never have grown. By bringing it into cultivation, and so disturbing
the natural condition of things, he caused the thistles to grow, thereby
creating a nuisance on the land just as much as if he had intentionally
grown them. The defendant, by entering into occupation of the
land with the nuisance on it, was under a duty to prevent damage
from thereby accruing to his neighbor. The case resembles that of
Crowhurst <em>v.</em> Amersham Burial Board, 4 Ex. D. 5, where the defendants
were held responsible for allowing the branches of their yew
trees to grow over their boundary, whereby a horse of the plaintiff,
being placed at pasture in the adjoining field, ate some of the yew
twigs and died.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Coleridge, C. J.</span> I never heard of such an action as this.
There can be no duty as between adjoining occupiers to cut the
thistles, which are the natural growth of the soil. The appeal must
be allowed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Esher, M. R.</span> I am of the same opinion.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Williams</span>, Associate Justice. This case is submitted upon the facts
found by the court below, upon an assignment which questions the
correctness of the conclusion of law based upon them. In brief, those
facts are, that appellant owns in fee a strip of land upon which its
railroad is laid, and on each side of which lie cultivated lands owned
by appellee. Upon the land owned by appellant there stands a natural
growth of tall trees which shade and injure the crops upon appellee’s
adjacent land, and also saps such land of its fertility. For this injury
to crops and land the judgment appealed from was rendered. No act
of defendant is shown beyond the construction and maintenance of its
road and its omission to cut down its trees, it having removed only
such portion of them as was necessary to permit the repair of its road
and the operation of its trains. We know of no principle of law which
authorizes the judgment. The land and the trees are the property of
appellant, and it has the same right to them that appellee has to his
land and crops. The exercise of one right is not an invasion of the
other. If the presence of the trees impairs the productiveness of appellee’s
land, or if the cultivation of the latter would injure the trees,
these results would constitute no wrong by one owner to the other, but
would only be the incidents of their ownership. No breach of any
duty owed by appellant to appellee is shown. It is not stated that
the roots or the branches of the trees penetrate or overhang appellee’s
land. If they did, appellee had the right to remove such roots or
branches as entered or overhung his land, or if damage was caused by
them, it may be true that he could maintain an action for such damage.
Wood on Nuisances, 112, 113, 306.</p>

<p class='c007'>But no such case is made here either in the statement of the cause
of action or in the facts found by the court. It is not shown that appellee
has not kept its right of way in proper condition for the safe
and proper operation of its trains, but the contrary is inferable from
the findings. Had it failed to do so, this might be a breach of the
duty which it owed to those interested in the manner in which it
conducted its road, but not of one due to appellee to protect his land
and crops from such damage as that of which he complains. It is
urged that as there is no statement of facts, we should presume that
enough was shown to sustain the judgment. But the conclusions of
the trial judge show affirmatively the facts upon which the judgment
is rendered, and the conclusion of law based upon those facts was excepted
to by appellant in the court below and is erroneous. It is not
a case where there is an omission to find some fact, but one in which
a ruling erroneous in law is grounded upon facts found.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>The action was trespass on the case, to recover damages, alleged
to have been done to the plaintiffs’ land, and to the fences and growth
thereon, by the negligence of the defendant in setting a fire on his
own land, near to the land of the plaintiffs, and in not carefully keeping
the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial before Emery, J., evidence was introduced by both
parties. The counsel for the plaintiffs requested the judge to instruct
the jury, that the plaintiffs were entitled to a verdict, if they were
satisfied from the evidence, that the damage was occasioned by the
defendant’s fire, unless he satisfied them that it was not through negligence
or mismanagement on his part. The judge instructed the jury,
that the burthen of proof was upon the plaintiffs to satisfy them, beyond
a reasonable doubt, that the damage was occasioned by the
defendant’s fire, and through the carelessness and negligence of the
defendant in keeping the same; such carelessness and negligence
being alleged in the plaintiffs’ declaration, and it not being contended
by the plaintiffs that the fire was wilfully and maliciously set by the
defendant. On the return of a verdict for the defendant, the plaintiffs
filed exceptions to the ruling of the judge.<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c015'><sup>[299]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The opinion of the Court was by</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Weston, C. J.</span> By the ancient common law, or custom of the realm,
if a house took fire, the owner was held answerable for any injury
thereby occasioned to others. This was probably founded upon some
presumed negligence or carelessness, not susceptible of proof. The
hardship of this rule was corrected by the statute of 6 Ann. c. 31,
which exempted the owner from liability, where the fire was occasioned
by accident. The rule does not appear to have been applied to the
owner of a field, where a fire may have been kindled. It may frequently
be necessary to burn stubble or other matter which encumbers
the ground. It is a lawful act, unless kindled at an improper
time or carelessly managed. Baron Comyns states, that an action of
the case lies, at common law, against the owner of a house which
takes fire, by which another is injured, and adds, “so if a fire be
kindled in a yard or close, to burn stubble, and by negligence it burns
corn in an adjoining close.” Com. Dig. Action of the Case for Negligence,
A. 6.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Clark <em>v.</em> Foot, 8 Johns. R. 421, it was held, that if A. sets fire
to his own fallow ground, as he may lawfully do, which communicates
to and fires the woodland of B., his neighbor, no action lies against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>A., unless there was some negligence or misconduct in him or his servants.
And this is a fair illustration of the common law, upon which
the action depends. Negligence or misconduct is the gist of the action.
And this must be proved. In certain cases, as in actions against
innkeepers and common carriers, it is presumed, by the policy of the
law, where property is lost which is confided to their care. But in
ordinary cases, of which the one before us is not an exception, where
the action depends on negligence, the burthen of proof is upon the
plaintiff. This is common learning, and applies to all affirmative
averments necessary to maintain an action. The defendant’s fire was
lawfully kindled on his own land. It is an element appropriated to
many valuable and useful purposes; but which may become destructive
from causes not subject to human control. Hence the fact, that
an injury has been done to others, is not in itself evidence of negligence.
The party who avers the fact is bound to satisfy the jury
upon this point, before he can be entitled to a verdict. In our opinion,
the direction of the presiding judge was correct as to the burthen of
the proof.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Appeal from judgment of the General Term of the Supreme Court
in the Second Judicial Department, affirming a judgment in favor of
defendant, entered upon a verdict. (Reported below, 16 Hun, 257.)</p>

<p class='c007'>This action was brought to recover damages for injuries to plaintiff’s
buildings, alleged to have been caused by the explosion of a
powder magazine on the premises of defendant; also to restrain the
defendant from manufacturing and storing upon his premises fire-works
or other explosive substances.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts are sufficiently stated in the opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Miller, J.</span> This action is sought to be maintained upon the ground
that the manufacturing and storing of fire-works, and the use and
keeping of materials of a dangerous and explosive character for that
purpose, constituted a private nuisance for which the defendant was
liable to respond in damages, without regard to the question whether
he was chargeable with carelessness or negligence. The defendant
had constructed a powder magazine upon his premises, with the usual
safeguards, in which he kept stored a quantity of powder which, without
any apparent cause, exploded and caused the injury complained
of. The judge upon the trial charged the jury that they must find for
the defendant, unless they found that the defendant carelessly and
negligently kept the gunpowder upon his premises. The judge refused
to charge that the powder magazine was dangerous in itself to
plaintiff and his property, and was a private nuisance, and the defendant
was liable to the plaintiff whether it was carelessly kept or
not; and the plaintiff duly excepted to the charge and the refusal to
charge.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think that the charge made was erroneous and not warranted
by the facts presented upon the trial. The defendant had erected a
building and stored materials therein, which from their character were
liable to and actually did explode, causing injury to the plaintiff. The
fact that the explosion took place tends to establish that the magazine
was dangerous and liable to cause damage to the property of persons
residing in the vicinity. The locality [legality?] of works of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>description must depend upon the neighborhood in which they are
situated. In a city, with buildings immediately contiguous and persons
constantly passing, there could be no question that such an erection
would be unlawful and unauthorized. An explosion under such
circumstances, independent of any municipal regulations, would
render the owner amenable for all damages arising therefrom. That
the defendant’s establishment was outside of the territorial limits of a
city does not relieve the owner from responsibility or alter the case, if
the dangerous erection was in close contiguity with dwelling-houses or
buildings which might be injured or destroyed in case of an explosion.
The fact that the magazine was liable to such a contingency, which
could not be guarded against or averted by the greatest degree of care
and vigilance, evinces its dangerous character, and might in some
localities render it a private nuisance. In such a case the rule which
exonerates a party engaged in a lawful business, when free from
negligence, has no application. The keeping or manufacturing of
gunpowder or of fire-works does not necessarily constitute a nuisance
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. That depends upon the locality, the quantity, and the surrounding
circumstances, and not entirely upon the degree of care used.
In the case at bar it should have been left for the jury to determine
whether from the dangerous character of the defendant’s business, the
proximity to other buildings, and all the facts proved upon the trial,
the defendant was chargeable with maintaining a private nuisance and
answerable for the damages arising from the explosion.</p>

<p class='c007'>A private nuisance is defined to be anything done to the hurt or
annoyance of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments of another. 3
Bl. Com. 216. Any unwarrantable, unreasonable, or unlawful use
by a person of his own property, real or personal, to the injury of
another, comes within the definition stated, and renders the owner or
possessor liable for all damages arising from such use. Wood’s Law
of Nuis., § 1, and authorities cited. The cases which are regarded as
private nuisances are numerous, and the books are full of decisions
holding the parties answerable for the injuries which result from their
being maintained. The rule is of universal application that while a
man may prosecute such business as he chooses on his own premises,
he has no right to erect and maintain a nuisance to the injury of
an adjoining proprietor or of his neighbors, even in the pursuit of a
lawful trade. Aldred’s Case, 9 Coke, 58; Brady <em>v.</em> Weeks, 3 Barb.
159; Dubois <em>v.</em> Budlong, 15 Abb. 445; Wier’s Appeal, 74 Penn. St.
230.</p>

<p class='c007'>While a class of the reported cases relates to the prosecution of a
legitimate business, which of itself produces inconvenience and injury
to others, another class refers to acts done on the premises of the
owner which are of themselves dangerous to the property and the persons
of others who may reside in the vicinity, or who may by chance
be passing along or in the neighborhood of the same. Of the former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>class are cases of slaughter-houses, fat and offal boiling establishments,
hog-styes or tallow manufactories, in or near a city, which are
offensive to the senses and render the enjoyment of life and property
uncomfortable. Catlin <em>v.</em> Valentine, 9 Pai. 575; Brady <em>v.</em> Weeks,
3 Barb. 157; Dubois <em>v.</em> Budlong, 15 Abb. 445; Rex <em>v.</em> White, 1 Burr.
337; 2 Bl. Com. 215; Farrand <em>v.</em> Marshall, 21 Barb. 421. It is not
necessary in these cases that the noxious trade or business should
endanger the health of the neighborhood. So also the use of premises
in a manner which causes a noise so continuous and excessive as to
produce serious annoyance, or vapors or noxious smells; Tipping <em>v.</em>
St. Helen’s Smelting Co., 4 B. &amp; S. (Q. B.) 608; Brill <em>v.</em> Flagler, 23
Wend. 354; Pickard <em>v.</em> Collins, 23 Barb. 444; Wood’s Law of Nuis.,
§ 5; or the burning of a brick kiln, from which gases escape which
injure the trees of persons in the neighborhood. Campbell <em>v.</em> Seaman,
63 N. Y. 568; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span>, 20 Am. Rep. 567. Of the latter class also are
those where the owner blasts rocks with gunpowder, and the fragments
are liable to be thrown on the premises and injure the adjoining
dwelling-houses, or the owner or persons there being, or where
persons travelling may be injured by such use. Hay <em>v.</em> Cohoes Co.,
3 Barb. 42; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span>, 2 N. Y. 159; Tremain <em>v.</em> Cohoes Co., 2 N. Y. 163;
Pixley <em>v.</em> Clark, 35 id. 523.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the cases cited rest upon the maxim <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic utere tuo</span></i>, etc.,
and where the right to the undisturbed possession and enjoyment of
property comes in conflict with the rights of others, that it is better,
as a matter of public policy, that a single individual should surrender
the use of his land for especial purposes injurious to his neighbor or
to others, than that the latter should be deprived of the use of their
property altogether, or be subjected to great danger, loss, and injury,
which might result if the rights of the former were without any restriction
or restraint.</p>

<p class='c007'>The keeping of gunpowder or other materials in a place, or under
circumstances, where it would be liable, in case of explosion, to injure
the dwelling-houses or the persons of those residing in close
proximity, we think, rests upon the same principle, and is governed
by the same general rules. An individual has no more right to keep
a magazine of powder upon his premises, which is dangerous, to the
detriment of his neighbor, than he is authorized to engage in any
other business which may occasion serious consequences.</p>

<p class='c007'>The counsel for the defendant relies upon the case of People <em>v.</em>
Sands, 1 Johns. 78; 3 Am. Dec. 296, to sustain the position that the
defendant’s business was neither a public nor a private nuisance.
That was an indictment for keeping a quantity of gunpowder near
dwelling-houses and near a public street; and it was held (Spencer,
J., dissenting), that the fact as charged did not amount to a nuisance,
and that it should have been alleged to have been negligently and
improvidently kept. It will be seen that the case was disposed of upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>the form of the indictment, and while it may well be that an allegation
of negligence is necessary where an indictment is for a public
nuisance, it by no means follows that negligence is essential in a private
action to recover damages for an alleged nuisance. In Myers <em>v.</em>
Malcolm, 6 Hill, 292, it was held that the act of keeping a large quantity
of gunpowder insufficiently secured near other buildings, thereby
endangering the lives of persons residing in the vicinity, amounted to
a public nuisance, and an action would lie for damages where an explosion
occurred causing injury. Nelson, C. J., citing People <em>v.</em> Sands,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, says: “Upon the principle that nothing will be intended or
inferred to support an indictment, the Court said, for aught they
could see, the house may have been one built and secured for the purpose
of keeping powder in such a way as not to expose the neighborhood;”
and he cites several authorities which uphold the doctrine
that where gunpowder is kept in such a place as is dangerous to the
inhabitants or passengers, it will be regarded as a nuisance. The case
of People <em>v.</em> Sands is not therefore controlling upon the question of
negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fillo <em>v.</em> Jones, 2 Abb. Ct. Ap. Dec. 121, is also relied upon, but does
not sustain the doctrine contended for; and it is there held that an
action for damages caused by the explosion of fire-works may be maintained
upon the theory that the defendant was guilty of a wrongful
and unlawful act, or of default, in keeping them at the place they
were kept, because they were liable to spontaneous combustion and
explosion, and thus endangered the lives of persons in their vicinity,
and that the injury was occasioned by such spontaneous combustion
and explosion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is apparent that negligence alone in the keeping of gunpowder
is not controlling, and that the danger arising from the locality where
the fire-works or gunpowder are kept, is to be taken into consideration
in maintaining an action of this character. We think that the request
to charge was too broad, and properly refused. The charge however
should have been in conformity with the rule herein laid down, and for
the error of the judge in the charge, the judgment should be reversed
and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>

<p class='c007'>All concur.</p>

<p class='c014'>Appeal from Court of Common Pleas, No. 2, of Allegheny County.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bill in equity by Robinson and forty-seven others against Dilworth,
to restrain Dilworth from erecting a powder magazine upon his lot in
Penn Township, Allegheny County. The case was referred to a master,
who recommended that an injunction should be refused and the
bill dismissed. The facts are set forth in the opinion of this court. The
court below thought that the public interest would be subserved by
refusing the injunction; but in deference to the authority of Wier’s
Appeal, 24 P. F. Smith, 230, a majority of the court entered a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro
forma</span></i> decree for an injunction. Appeal was taken to the Supreme
Court.<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c015'><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Trunkey, J.</span> [After stating general principles and quoting from
the statement of the facts in Wier’s Appeal.]</p>

<p class='c007'>After a careful revision of the master’s report by the court below,
the facts found in this case, and which are well sustained by proof,
are as follows: This magazine has been located so as to endanger as
few persons and as little property as possible, and yet be reasonably
accessible as a point of supply and distribution; it is more remote
from population than the magazines generally in use throughout the
United States, and it is doubtful if a better location could be made in
Allegheny County. It is situated about two miles from East Liberty,
the nearest closely built-up district, and is separated therefrom by intervening
hills and ravines. It is in a sparsely settled locality, for
the vicinity of a city, and land near it has not been, nor is it likely to
be for some years, in demand for building purposes. That portion of
Lincoln Avenue which terminates at a point five hundred feet from
the magazine is very little travelled, very few people travel it within
considerable distance of its terminus, having no occasion to do so; it
was the wildest of the many absurd enterprises undertaken in Pittsburgh
to carry city improvements into wild rural regions, expecting
population to rapidly follow. The other public road, passing within
twenty-two feet of the magazine, has for some time been almost abandoned
by the people in the vicinity, and is used by about three
farmers. The magazine is so situated that the force of an explosion
would be down the ravine and away from the road. The greater distance
of this magazine from a borough, or closely built-up district,
the absence of demand of land for building purposes, and the unlikelihood
of such demand in the vicinity, the little travel on the public
road which passes near it, and the ravine opening from the road, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>the chief points wherein this case differs from Wier’s Appeal. The
dwellings and families near the magazine number about the same in
one as the other. None will deny that the law protects the small and
cheap home as it does the large and costly mansion, and the rights
of a tenant are as sacred as those of his landlord. But it is equally
undeniable that if a tenant hold by lease at will, or by month, and his
landlord grants that a lawful and necessary, yet offensive or dangerous
factory or magazine may be erected, the tenant has not a right of
action for its prevention. If such structure were placed near tenant
houses occupied by miners, where the mines are likely to be worked
for considerable time, it would be a material fact to be weighed with
others—almost of like weight as if the houses were owned by the
occupants. Here the mine is nearly exhausted, a fact to be considered
in reference to the probable increase of population in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was urged that the location being only two hundred and fifty-five
feet from the boundary line of Pittsburgh, and five hundred feet from
the end of Lincoln Avenue, is dangerous to life and property in the
city. The facts, as we have seen, are that that end of the avenue is
very little travelled, and is remote from the population of the city;
and, without question, “the region of country in which the magazine
is located is wild and broken as to its general surface, it is traversed
by numerous ravines and hills, and altogether possesses a romantic
and secluded aspect.” It is the real character of the location, with its
surroundings, which determines its fitness, and not a city line two
miles from city life, nor the unused and useless part of a graded and
paved street extended beyond the visible city.</p>

<p class='c007'>Confessedly, the demand for and consumption of powder in Pittsburgh
and vicinity are very great, and it is indispensable in carrying
on important branches of industry, and it would be inimical to the
business interests of the community to trammel the sale of it with
unnecessary restrictions and burdens. Besides the magazine at the
United States Arsenal there are no others in Allegheny County, except
those of a single company, and the Dilworth. In view of the
whole case the master, and one of the judges of the Common Pleas,
thought the injunction should be refused. The majority of the court,
in a considerate opinion, concluded that the public interest would be
subserved by refusing the injunction, and that the complainants were
not entitled to an injunction, but for the ruling in Wier’s Appeal, on
the authority of which they felt constrained to grant it. A decree was
entered, with direction that it would not be enforced until the defendant
could be heard on appeal. We fully agree with the court below,
except that we do not think the principles in Wier’s Appeal, applied
to the facts in this case, require an injunction to be granted.</p>

<p class='c014'>Per Curiam.<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c015'><sup>[303]</sup></a> One of the principal questions litigated upon the
trial of this action related to the alleged negligence of the driver of
the defendant’s team in leaving the horses untied in the street, which,
it was claimed, was the cause of the death of the intestate. Among
other evidence to establish such negligence, the plaintiff offered and
introduced in evidence, against the objection of the defendant, an ordinance
of the city of Brooklyn, prohibiting the leaving of any horse
or horses attached to a vehicle standing in any street without a person
in charge, or without being secured to a tying post. We think there
is no question as to the admissibility of such testimony under the
decisions of this court, and the exception taken to the ruling in this
respect cannot be upheld.</p>

<p class='c007'>A more serious question arises as to the effect to be given to the evidence
referred to. At the close of the charge the plaintiff’s counsel
requested the judge to charge the jury that a violation of an ordinance
of the city is necessarily negligence; and the judge replied: “it is;
I have so told the jury; it is negligence;” and the defendant’s counsel
excepted. We think there was error in the charge thus made, and
that the judge went too far in holding that a violation of the ordinance
was negligence of itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question presented has been the subject of consideration in this
court, as will be seen by reference to the reported cases. In Brown
<em>v.</em> B. &amp; State Line R. R. Co., 22 N. Y. 191, the court charged the jury
that if the injury occurred while defendant’s train was running in
violation of a city ordinance and at a rate of speed forbidden by it,
and was occasioned by or would not have occurred except for such
violation, the defendant was liable, and this direction was held to be
error. This doctrine is, however, repudiated in Jetter <em>v.</em> N. Y. &amp; H.
R. R. Co., 2 Abb. Ct. App. Dec. 458, as well as in subsequent cases.
In the last case cited it was held that a party in doing a lawful act,
where there is no present danger, or appearance of danger, has a right
to assume that others will conform their conduct to the express requirements
of the law and not bring injury upon him by its violation.
It is also strongly intimated that a violator of such an ordinance is a
wrong-doer and necessarily negligent, and a person injured thereby is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>entitled to a civil remedy. The distinct point now raised was not,
however, fairly presented by the charge to which exception was taken,
which was not otherwise erroneous. In Beisegel <em>v.</em> N. Y. C. R. R.
Co., 14 Abb. Pr. [N. S.] 29, it was held that it was some evidence of
negligence to show that an ordinance was violated, and the charge of
the judge upon the trial to that effect was upheld. In McGrath <em>v.</em>
N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 63 N. Y. 522, it was laid down that the
violation or disregard of an ordinance, while not conclusive evidence
of negligence, is some evidence for the consideration of the jury. In
Massoth <em>v.</em> D. &amp; H. Canal Co., 64 N. Y. 524, the cases are reviewed,
and it was said to be an open question in this court whether the violation
of a municipal ordinance was negligence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>; and it was held
that the city ordinance being submitted to the jury with the other
evidence as bearing upon the question, but not as conclusive, there
was no error in the parts of the charge excepted to. The result of the
decisions, therefore, is, that the violation of the ordinance is some evidence
of negligence, but not necessarily negligence. The judge not
only assented unqualifiedly to the request made, but he also said that
it was negligence; and thus went further than to hold, within the
cases cited, that it was evidence of negligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The counsel for the plaintiff urges that even if erroneous, the charge
worked defendant no injury. This position is based upon the theory
that as the question was submitted to the jury as one of fact, whether
the team was left loose and unattended, and as the judge had charged
that the ordinance adds very little to what would have been the rule
without it, and that it was negligence to leave a horse untied or not
in charge of some one, in a public street, whether there is an ordinance
or not, they must have found that they were so left, and, therefore,
the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. The difficulty about this
position is, that the question, whether leaving the horses untied was
negligence, was one of fact depending upon the circumstances attending
the case, and while the jury may have found in favor of the defendant
as to this, their verdict may have resulted from the charge
made as to the effect of the ordinance. It cannot, therefore, be said
that by the portion of the charge which has been considered the defendant
was not prejudiced.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the error in the charge, without considering the other questions
raised, the judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, costs
to abide event.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Hough, J.</span><a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c015'><sup>[305]</sup></a> This was an action to recover damages for the killing
of a cow, belonging to the plaintiff, by a train on defendant’s railroad
in a street of the town of Cameron.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evidence given at the trial is stated in the bill of exceptions in
the following language: “The plaintiff, to maintain the issues on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>part, introduced evidence tending to show, that the bell was not rung,
nor the whistle sounded on the train mentioned in his statement, as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>approached and ran over the cow in controversy; that the cow was
killed on defendant’s railroad on a public travelled street of the town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>of Cameron, in Shoal township, by a train on said railroad, and that
said cow was worth thirty-five dollars. The defendant introduced one
Kiley, who testified that he was the conductor on said train, and that
the bell was rung and the whistle sounded. This was all the evidence
offered.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It will not be necessary to notice the instructions given and refused.
There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendant
has brought the case here by appeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statute in relation to railroad corporations, which requires the
bell on the locomotive to be rung, or the steam whistle to be sounded,
before reaching and while crossing any travelled public road or street,
provides a penalty for the neglect of such requirement, and further
declares that the corporation shall be liable for all damages which shall
be sustained by any person by reason of such neglect. Conceding that
the servants of the defendant neglected to ring the bell or sound the
whistle, the question is whether there is any evidence tending to show
that the cow was killed by reason of such neglect.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of Stoneman <em>v.</em> Atl. &amp; Pac. R. R. Co., 58 Mo. 503, it was
said, on the point in judgment, that “the court had no right to declare
as a matter of law, that the jury had nothing to find but the
killing of the animal at the crossing of a public highway, and the
failure of the company to have the bell rung or the whistle sounded.
There may have been no connection, whatever, between the negligent
omission and the damage; and the very terms of the statute, under
which the suit is brought, clearly indicate that the damage must be
the result of the negligence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The foregoing extract clearly asserts, that there is no necessary connection
between the failure to ring the bell or sound the whistle, and
the killing; that both may concur in point of time, and the latter not
be the result of the former. How, then, must the connection be
shown? By evidence, undoubtedly. Who must produce such evidence?
The party who asserts that such connection exists. The
damage must be shown to be the result of the negligence; that is, the
negligence must first be shown, and this fact must be supplemented by
testimony tending to show that the negligence occasioned the damage.
This testimony should consist of all the facts and circumstances attending
the killing, so that the jury could fairly and rationally conclude
whether it resulted from the failure to ring the bell or sound the
whistle, or from other causes. In the case at bar no such testimony
was offered; but two facts were shown to fix the defendants liability,
the failure to give the required signal at the crossing, and the killing.
No fact was shown tending to connect the two. If the plaintiff can
recover on the evidence embodied in the bill of exceptions, it must be,
because it is only necessary for the jury to find the killing of the animal
on the highway, and the failure to ring the bell or sound the whistle,
for there is no testimony from which they can find more. But this, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>have seen, is not sufficient. Upon the case made, it was the duty of
the court to declare as a matter of law that the plaintiff was not entitled
to recover.</p>

<p class='c007'>This conclusion has been reached after a careful consideration of
the case of Owens <em>v.</em> Hann. &amp; St. Jo. R. R., 58 Mo. 386; and Howenstein
<em>v.</em> Pac. R. R., 55 Mo. 33.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded. All the

<h5 class='c013'>BRATTLEBORO <em>v.</em> WAIT<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Vermont, February Term, 1872.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 44 Vermont Reports, 459.</em></h5>

<p class='c014'>Action on the case, to recover damages sustained by reason of the
defendant’s neglect and refusal to comply with the requirements of
§ 39, ch. 83 of the General Statutes, and § 1 of No. 6 of the acts of the
legislature of 1865. Demurrer to the declaration by the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court, September term, 1870, <span class='sc'>Barrett, J.</span>, presiding, sustained
the demurrer, and rendered judgment for the defendant. Exceptions
by the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opinion of the court was delivered by.—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Ross, J.</span> The question in this case is whether the defendant as
cashier of the Windham County Bank for the years commencing April
1, 1864, and April 1, 1865, and of the First National Bank of Brattleboro
for the years commencing April 1, 1866, and April 1, 1867, is
liable for any loss that may have resulted to the town, by his neglect
to return to the town clerk of the plaintiff, for the first two years
named, the names of the stockholders in the Windham County Bank,
agreeably to the requirements of § 39, ch. 83 of the General Statutes,
and for the last two years the names of the stockholders of the First
National Bank of Brattleboro, agreeably to the requirements of § 1,
of No. 6 of the acts of 1865; or whether the penalties imposed by § 47
of ch. 83, and by § 5 of the act of 1865, are the only remedies given
for the neglect of the defendant to perform the duties imposed by the
two sections first above named.</p>

<p class='c007'>These duties are created solely by the statutes named, and by them
are superimposed upon the defendant in addition to those duties which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>were incumbent on him by reason of his acceptance of the office of
cashier. The principle, that the law will furnish a remedy to a party
injured by the neglect or non-performance of a duty imposed on an
individual by statute, where the statute itself furnishes no remedy, is
too familiar and well established to need the support of authorities.
If the statute which imposes a new duty also provides a particular
remedy, that remedy is usually the only remedy the injured party has.
In Regina <em>v.</em> Wigg, 2 Salk. 460, the court says: “Where a new penalty
is applied for a matter which at common law was an indictable
offence, either remedy may be pursued; but where the statute makes
the offence, that remedy must be taken which the statute gives.”
Lord <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, in Rex <em>v.</em> Robinson, 2 Bur. 799, stating the doctrine
more fully, says: “The true rule of distinction seems to be, that where
the offence intended to be guarded against was punishable before the
making of such statute, prescribing a particular method of punishing
it, there such particular remedy is cumulative, and does not take away
the former remedy; but where the statute only enacts ‘that the doing
any act not punishable before, shall for the future be punishable in
such and such a particular manner there,’ it is necessary that such
particular method, by such act prescribed, must be specifically pursued,
and not the common law method of an indictment.” The doctrine
stated in these early leading cases is as applicable to civil as to
criminal prosecutions. The question then is, was the penalty or forfeiture
of $100 provided for by § 47, ch. 83 of the General Statutes,
and of $500 provided for in § 5 of the act of 1865, intended for the
remedies to the plaintiff for the non-performance by the defendant of
the duties imposed by § 39, and by § 1. We think they were. The
penalties under these statutes are given to the town, as the party injured
or aggrieved by the failure of the defendant to perform the
duties imposed, as has been held in Newman, Treasurer of Brattleboro,
<em>v.</em> this defendant, 43 Vt. 587, in which the plaintiff through its treasurer
sought to recover the penalty imposed by § 5 of the act of 1865,
for the defendant’s failure to comply with § 1 of that act during the
years 1866 and 1867. It is unnecessary to repeat what has been said
in that case. It would be inconsistent with the principle we have
already stated, to hold that the plaintiff can recover the penalty as the
party aggrieved, and also all damages it has sustained by the defendant’s
failure to perform a duty wholly imposed upon him by the
statute. Such holding would give the plaintiff a double remedy for
the same failure by the defendant to perform a duty imposed by
statute, and due to the plaintiff only by the force of the statute; the
penalty prescribed, and an amercement in damages for all the plaintiff
can show he has suffered from such failure. The penalty cannot
be held to be a cumulative remedy; for before the passage of the act
no duty was due from the defendant as cashier to the plaintiff, and,
therefore, there could be no remedy, and nothing for the penalty to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>cumulative to. Such holding would interpret one and the same act
as giving a double remedy, which is contrary to all rules of interpretation,
and only allowable when it is given in express terms by the
statute.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Appeal by defendant from a judgment of the District Court for
Ramsey County, where the action was tried before Kelly, J., and a
jury, and a verdict rendered for plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mitchell, J.</span> Upon the record in this case it must be taken as
the facts that defendant’s clerk in his drug-store, in the course of his
employment as such, sold to plaintiff’s intestate a deadly poison without
labelling it “Poison,” as required by statute; that she, in ignorance
of its deadly qualities, partook of the poison, which caused her
death. Except for the ability of counsel and the earnestness with
which they have argued the case, we would not have supposed that
there could be any serious doubt of defendant’s liability on this state
of facts. It is immaterial for present purposes whether section 329
of the Penal Code or section 14, c. 147, Laws 1885, or both, are still
in force, and constitute the law governing this case.<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c015'><sup>[308]</sup></a> The requirements
of both statutes are substantially the same, and the sole object
of both is to protect the public against the dangerous qualities
of poison. It is now well settled, certainly in this state, that where
a statute or municipal ordinance imposes upon any person a specific
duty for the protection or benefit of others, if he neglects to perform
that duty he is liable to those for whose protection or benefit it was
imposed for any injuries of the character which the statute or ordinance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>was designed to prevent, and which were proximately produced
by such neglect. In support of this we need only cite our own decision
in Bott <em>v.</em> Pratt, 33 Minn. 323 (23 N. W. Rep. 237).</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant contends that this is only true where a right of action
for the alleged negligent act existed at common law; that no liability
existed at common law for selling poison without labelling it, and
therefore none exists under this statute, no right of civil action being
given by it. Without stopping to consider the correctness of the assumption
that selling poison without labelling it might not be actionable
negligence at common law, it is sufficient to say that, in our
opinion, defendant’s contention proceeds upon an entire misapprehension
of the nature and gist of a cause of action of this kind. The
common law gives a right of action to every one sustaining injuries
caused proximately by the negligence of another. The present is a
common-law action, the gist of which is defendant’s negligence,
resulting in the death of plaintiff’s intestate. Negligence is the breach
of legal duty. It is immaterial whether the duty is one imposed by
the rule of common law requiring the exercise of ordinary care not to
injure another, or is imposed by a statute designed for the protection
of others. In either case the failure to perform the duty constitutes
negligence, and renders the party liable for injuries resulting from it.
The only difference is that in the one case the measure of legal duty
is to be determined upon common-law principles, while in the other
the statute fixes it, so that the violation of the statute constitutes conclusive
evidence of negligence, or, in other words, negligence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>.
The action in the latter case is not a statutory one, nor does the statute
give the right of action in any other sense except that it makes an act
negligent which otherwise might not be such, or at least only evidence
of negligence. All that the statute does is to establish a fixed standard
by which the fact of negligence may be determined. The gist of the
action is still negligence, or the non-performance of a legal duty to the
person injured.</p>

<p class='c007'>What has been already said suggests the answer to the further contention
that if any civil liability exists it is only against the clerk who
sold the poison, and who alone is criminally liable. Whether the act
constituting the actionable negligence was such on common-law principles,
or is made such by statute, the doctrine of agency applies, to
wit, that the master is civilly liable for the negligence of his servant
committed in the course of his employment, and resulting in injuries
to third persons.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Earl, J.</span><a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c015'><sup>[310]</sup></a> This is an action to recover damages for the death of
plaintiff’s wife, alleged to have been caused by the fault of the defendant.
Prior to the 1st day of November, 1877, the plaintiff hired of the
defendant certain apartments in the rear of the third story of a tenement
house in the city of Brooklyn, and with his wife and infant child
moved into them on that day. On the fifth day in the same month, in
the daytime, a fire took place, originating in the lower story of the
house, and plaintiff’s wife and child were smothered to death.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is claimed that the defendant was in fault because he had not
constructed for the house a fire-escape, and because he had not placed
in the house a ladder for access to the scuttle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 36 of title 13 of chapter 863 of the Laws of 1873 provides
that every building in the city of Brooklyn shall have a scuttle or place
of egress in the roof thereof of proper size, and “shall have ladders
or stairways leading to the same; and all such scuttles and stairways
or ladders leading to the roof shall be kept in readiness for use at all
times.” It also provides that houses like that occupied by the plaintiff
“shall be provided with such fire-escapes and doors as shall be
directed and approved by the commissioners (of the department of fire
and buildings); and the owner or owners of any building upon which
any fire-escapes may now or hereafter be erected, shall keep the same
in good repair and well painted, and no person shall at any time place
any incumbrance of any kind whatsoever upon said fire-escapes now
erected or that may hereafter be erected in the city. Any person, after
being notified by said commissioners, who shall neglect to place upon
any such building the fire-escape herein provided for, shall forfeit the
sum of $500, and shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Under this statute the defendant was bound to provide this house
with a fire-escape. He was not permitted to wait until he should be
directed to provide one by the commissioners. He was bound to do it
in such way as they should direct and approve, and it was for him to
procure their direction and approval. No penalty is imposed for the
simple omission to provide one. The penalty can be incurred only for
the neglect to provide one after notification by the commissioners.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here was, then, an absolute duty imposed upon the defendant by
statute to provide a fire-escape, and the duty was imposed for the sole
benefit of the tenants of the house, so that they would have a mode of
escape in the case of a fire. For a breach of this duty causing damage,
it cannot be doubted that the tenants have a remedy. It is a general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>rule, that whenever one owes another a duty, whether such duty be
imposed by voluntary contract or by statute, a breach of such duty
causing damage gives a cause of action. Duty and right are correlative;
and where a duty is imposed, there must be a right to have it
performed. When a statute imposes a duty upon a public officer, it is
well settled that any person having a special interest in the performance
thereof may sue for a breach thereof causing him damage, and the
same is true of a duty imposed by statute upon any citizen: (Cooley
on Torts, 654; Hover <em>v.</em> Barkhoff, 44 N. Y. 113; Jetter <em>v.</em> N. Y. C.
and H. R. R. R. Co., 2 Abb. Ct. of App. Dec. 458; Heeney <em>v.</em> Sprague,
11 R. I. 456; Couch <em>v.</em> Steele, 3 Ell. &amp; Bl. 402). In Comyn’s Digest,
Action upon Statute (F.), it is laid down as the rule that “in every
case where a statute enacts or prohibits a thing for the benefit of a
person, he shall have a remedy upon the same statute for the thing
enacted for his advantage, or for the recompense of a wrong done to
him contrary to the said law.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Declaration, first count: that after the passing of the Contagious
Diseases (Animals) Act, 1869, the Privy Council, in exercise of the
powers and authorities vested in them by the Act (s. 75), made an
order (called the Animals Order of 1871) with reference to animals
brought by sea to ports in Great Britain, and to the places used and
occupied by such animals on board any vessel in which the same
should be so brought to such ports; and thereby, amongst other
things, ordered (1) that every such place should be divided into pens
by substantial divisions; (2) that each such pen should not exceed
nine feet in breadth and fifteen feet in length; that afterwards and
whilst the order was in force the plaintiffs delivered on board a vessel
called the Hastings, to the defendant as owner of the vessel, certain
sheep of the plaintiffs, to be carried by the defendant for reward on
board the said vessel from Hamburg to Newcastle, and there delivered
to the plaintiffs; and the defendant, as such owner, received and
started on the said voyage with the sheep for the purposes and on the
terms aforesaid; that all conditions were fulfilled, &amp;c., yet the place in
and on board the said vessel which was used and occupied by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>sheep during the voyage was not, during the said voyage or any part
thereof, divided into pens by substantial or other divisions, by reason
whereof divers of the sheep were washed and swept away by the sea
from off the said ship, and were drowned and wholly lost to the
plaintiffs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Second count, similar to the first, but setting out a third regulation:
“that the floor of each such pen should have proper battens or other
foot-hold thereon,” and alleging the loss of the sheep as aforesaid to
have been caused by the want of such battens.</p>

<p class='c007'>Demurrer and joinder.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The preamble of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act of 1869,
32 &amp; 33 Vict. chapter 70, recited in a note to the report, is as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whereas it is expedient to confer on Her Majesty’s most honourable
Privy Council powers to take such measures as may appear from
time to time necessary to prevent the introduction into Great Britain
of contagious or infectious diseases among cattle, sheep, and other
animals, by prohibiting or regulating the importation of foreign animals;
and it is further expedient to provide against the spreading of
such diseases in Great Britain, and to consolidate and make perpetual
the Acts relating thereto, and to make such other provisions as are
contained in this Act.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sect. 75 of said Act: “The Privy Council may from time to time
make such orders as they think expedient for all or any of the following
purposes:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“For insuring for animals brought by sea to ports in Great Britain
a proper supply of food and water during the passage and on landing;</p>

<p class='c007'>“For protecting such animals from unnecessary suffering during the
passage and on landing;</p>

<p class='c007'>(Then follow certain inland purposes.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“And generally any orders whatsoever which they think it expedient
to make for the better execution of this Act, or for the purpose of
in any manner preventing the introduction or spreading of contagious
or infectious disease among animals in Great Britain.”]<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c015'><sup>[312]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Kelly, C. B.</span> This is an action to recover damages for the loss of
a number of sheep which the defendant, a shipowner, had contracted
to carry, and which were washed overboard and lost by reason (as we
must take it to be truly alleged) of the neglect to comply with a certain
order made by the Privy Council, in pursuance of the Contagious
Diseases (Animals) Act, 1869. The Act was passed merely for sanitary
purposes, in order to prevent animals in a state of infectious disease
from communicating it to other animals with which they might
come in contact. Under the authority of that Act certain orders were
made; amongst others, an order by which any ship bringing sheep or
cattle from any foreign port to ports in Great Britain is to have the
place occupied by such animals divided into pens of certain dimensions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>and the floor of such pens furnished with battens or foot-holds.
The object of this order is to prevent animals from being overcrowded,
and so brought into a condition in which the disease guarded against
would be likely to be developed. This regulation has been neglected,
and the question is, whether the loss, which we must assume to have
been caused by that neglect, entitles the plaintiffs to maintain an
action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The argument of the defendant is, that the Act has imposed penalties
to secure the observance of its provisions, and that, according to
the general rule, the remedy prescribed by the statute must be pursued;
that although, when penalties are imposed for the violation of
a statutory duty, a person aggrieved by its violation may sometimes
maintain an action for the damage so caused, that must be in cases
where the object of the statute is to confer a benefit on individuals,
and to protect them against the evil consequences which the statute
was designed to prevent, and which have in fact ensued; but that if
the object is not to protect individuals against the consequences which
have in fact ensued, it is otherwise; that if, therefore, by reason of
the precautions in question not having been taken, the plaintiffs had
sustained that damage against which it was intended to secure them,
an action would lie, but that when the damage is of such a nature as
was not contemplated at all by the statute, and as to which it was not
intended to confer any benefit on the plaintiffs, they cannot maintain
an action founded on the neglect. The principle may be well illustrated
by the case put in argument of a breach by a railway company
of its duty to erect a gate on a level crossing, and to keep the gate
closed except when the crossing is being actually and properly used.
The object of the precaution is to prevent injury from being sustained
through animals or vehicles being upon the line at unseasonable times;
and if by reason of such a breach of duty, either in not erecting the
gate, or in not keeping it closed, a person attempts to cross with a
carriage at an improper time, and injury ensues to a passenger, no
doubt an action would lie against the railway company, because the
intention of the legislature was that, by the erection of the gates and
by their being kept closed individuals should be protected against
accidents of this description. And if we could see that it was the object,
or among the objects of this Act, that the owners of sheep and
cattle coming from a foreign port should be protected by the means
described against the danger of their property being washed overboard,
or lost by the perils of the sea, the present action would be
within the principle.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, looking at the Act, it is perfectly clear that its provisions were
all enacted with a totally different view; there was no purpose, direct
or indirect, to protect against such damage; but, as is recited in the
preamble, the Act is directed against the possibility of sheep or cattle
being exposed to disease on their way to this country. The preamble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>recites that “it is expedient to confer on Her Majesty’s most honourable
Privy Council power to take such measures as may appear from
time to time necessary to prevent the introduction into Great Britain
of contagious or infectious diseases among cattle, sheep, or other animals,
by prohibiting or regulating the importation of foreign animals,”
and also to provide against the “spreading” of such diseases in Great
Britain. Then follow numerous sections directed entirely to this object.
Then comes sect. 75 which enacts that “the Privy Council may
from time to time make such orders as they think expedient for all
or any of the following purposes.” What, then, are these purposes?
They are “for securing for animals brought by sea to ports in Great
Britain a proper supply of food and water during the passage and on
landing,” “for protecting such animals from unnecessary suffering
during the passage and on landing,” and so forth; all the purposes
enumerated being calculated and directed to the prevention of disease,
and none of them having any relation whatever to the danger of loss
by the perils of the sea. That being so, if by reason of the default
in question the plaintiffs’ sheep had been overcrowded, or had been
caused unnecessary suffering, and so had arrived in this country in
a state of disease, I do not say that they might not have maintained
this action. But the damage complained of here is something totally
apart from the object of the Act of Parliament, and it is in accordance
with all the authorities to say that the action is not maintainable.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pigott, B.</span> For the reasons which have been so exhaustively stated
by the Lord Chief Baron, I am of opinion that the declaration shows
no cause of action. It is necessary to see what was the object of the
legislature in this enactment, and it is set forth clearly in the preamble
as being “to prevent the introduction into Great Britain of
contagious or infectious diseases among cattle, sheep, or other animals,”
and the “spread of such diseases in Great Britain.” The purposes
enumerated in sect. 75 are in harmony with this preamble, and
it is in furtherance of that section that the order in question was made.
The object, then, of the regulations which have been broken was, not
to prevent cattle from being washed overboard, but to protect them
against contagious disease. The legislature never contemplated altering
the relations between the owners and carriers of cattle, except for
the purposes pointed out in the Act; and if the Privy Council had
gone out of their way and made provisions to prevent cattle from being
washed overboard, their act would have been <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultra vires</span></i>. If, indeed,
by reason of the neglect complained of, the cattle had contracted a
contagious disease, the case would have been different. But as the
case stands on this declaration, the answer to the action is this: Admit
there has been a breach of duty; admit there has been a consequent
injury; still the legislature was not legislating to protect against such
an injury, but for an altogether different purpose; its object was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>to regulate the duty of the carrier for all purposes, but only for one
particular purpose.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV<br /> DECEIT</h3>

<h4 class='c013'>PASLEY <em>v.</em> FREEMAN<br /> <span class='sc'>In the King’s Bench, Hilary Term, 1789.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 3 Term Reports (Durnford &amp; East), 51.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>This was an action in the nature of a writ of deceit, to which the
defendant pleaded the general issue. And after a verdict for the plaintiffs
on the third count, a motion was made in arrest of judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third count was as follows: “And whereas, also, the said
Joseph Freeman afterwards, to wit, on the twenty-first day of February,
in the year of our Lord 1787, at London aforesaid, in the parish
and ward aforesaid, further intending to deceive and defraud the said
John Pasley and Edward, did wrongfully and deceitfully encourage
and persuade the said John Pasley and Edward to sell and deliver to
the said John Christopher Falch divers other goods, wares, and merchandises,
to wit, sixteen other bags of cochineal of great value, to wit,
of the value of £2,634 16<em>s.</em> 1<em>d.</em> upon trust and credit; and did for that
purpose then and there falsely, deceitfully, and fraudulently assert and
affirm to the said John Pasley and Edward that the said John Christopher
then and there was a person safely to be trusted and given
credit to in that respect, and did thereby falsely, fraudulently, and deceitfully
cause and procure the said John Pasley and Edward to sell
and deliver the said last-mentioned goods, wares, and merchandises
upon trust and credit to the said John Christopher; and, in fact, they
the said John Pasley and Edward, confiding in, and giving credit to,
the said last-mentioned assertion and affirmation of the said Joseph,
and believing the same to be true, and not knowing the contrary
thereof, did afterwards, to wit, on the twenty-eighth day of February,
in the year of our Lord 1787, at London aforesaid, in the parish and
ward aforesaid, sell and deliver the said last-mentioned goods, wares,
and merchandises upon trust and credit to the said John Christopher;
whereas in truth and fact, at the time of the said Joseph’s making his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>said last-mentioned assertion and affirmation, the said John Christopher
was not then and there a person safely to be trusted and given
credit to in that respect, and the said Joseph well knew the same, to
wit, at London aforesaid, in the parish and ward aforesaid. And the
said John Pasley and Edward further say, that the said John Christopher
hath not, nor hath any other person on his behalf, paid to the
said John Pasley and Edward, or either of them, the said sum of
£2,634 16<em>s.</em> 1<em>d.</em> last mentioned, or any part thereof, for the said last-mentioned
goods, wares, and merchandises; but, on the contrary, the
said John Christopher then was and still is wholly unable to pay the
said sum of money last mentioned, or any part thereof, to the said
John and Edward, to wit, at London aforesaid, in the parish and ward
aforesaid; and the said John Pasley and Edward aver that the said
Joseph falsely and fraudulently deceived them in this, that at the time
of his making his said last-mentioned assertion and affirmation the
said John Christopher was not a person safely to be trusted or given
credit to in that respect, as aforesaid, and the said Joseph then well
knew the same, to wit, at London aforesaid, in the parish and ward
aforesaid; by reason of which said last-mentioned false, fraudulent,
and deceitful assertion and affirmation of the said Joseph, the said
John Pasley and Edward have been deceived and imposed upon, and
have wholly lost the said last-mentioned goods, wares, and merchandises,
and the value thereof, to wit, at London aforesaid, in the parish
and ward aforesaid, to the damage,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Application was first made for a new trial, which after argument was
refused, and then this motion in arrest of judgment. <em>Wood</em> argued for
the plaintiffs, and <em>Russell</em> for the defendant, in the last term; but as
the Court went so fully into this subject in giving their opinions, it is
unnecessary to give the arguments at the bar.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court took time to consider of this matter, and now delivered
their opinions <em>seriatim</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Grose, J.</span> Upon the face of this count in the declaration no privity
of contract is stated between the parties. No consideration arises to
the defendant; and he is in no situation in which the law considers
him in any trust, or in which it demands from him any account of the
credit of Falch. He appears not to be interested in any transaction
between the plaintiffs and Falch, nor to have colluded with them; but
he knowingly asserted a falsehood, by saying that Falch might be
safely intrusted with the goods, and given credit to, for the purpose of
inducing the plaintiffs to trust him with them, by which the plaintiffs
lost the value of the goods. Then this is an action against the defendant
for making a false affirmation, or telling a lie, respecting the credit
of a third person, with intent to deceive, by which the third person was
damnified; and for the damages suffered, the plaintiffs contend that
the defendant is answerable in an action upon the case. It is admitted
that the action is new in point of precedent; but it is insisted that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>law recognizes principles on which it may be supported. The principle
upon which it is contended to lie is that, wherever deceit or falsehood
is practised to the detriment of another, the law will give redress.
This proposition I controvert, and shall endeavor to show that, in
every case where deceit or falsehood is practised to the detriment of
another, the law will not give redress; and I say that by the law, as it
now stands, no action lies against any person standing in the predicament
of this defendant for the false affirmation stated in the declaration.
If the action can be supported, it must be upon the ground that
there exists in this case what the law deems <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum cum injuria</span></i>. If it
does, I admit that the action lies; and I admit that upon the verdict
found the plaintiffs appear to have been damnified. But whether there
has been <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">injuria</span></i>, a wrong, a tort, for which an action lies, is a matter
of law. The tort complained of is the false affirmation made with
intent to deceive; and it is said to be an action upon the case analogous
to the old writ of deceit. When this was first argued at the bar, on the
motion for a new trial, I confess I thought it reasonable that the action
should lie; but, on looking into the old books for cases in which the
old action of deceit has been maintained upon the false affirmation of
the defendant, I have changed my opinion. The cases on this head
are brought together in Bro. tit. Deceit, pl. 29, and in Fitz. Abr. I
have likewise looked into Danvers, Kitchins, and Comyns, and I have
not met with any case of an action upon a false affirmation, except
against a party to a contract, and where there is a promise, either
express or implied, that the fact is true, which is misrepresented; and
no other case has been cited at the bar. Then if no such case has ever
existed, it furnishes a strong objection against the action, which is
brought for the first time for a supposed injury, which has been daily
committed for centuries past. For I believe there has been no time
when men have not been constantly damnified by the fraudulent misrepresentations
of others; and if such an action would have lain, there
certainly has been, and will be, a plentiful source of litigation, of
which the public are not hitherto aware. A variety of cases may be
put. Suppose a man recommends an estate to another, as knowing it
to be of greater value than it is; when the purchaser has bought it he
discovers the defect, and sells the estate for less than he gave; why
may not an action be brought for the loss upon any principle that
will support this action? And yet such an action has never been
attempted. Or suppose a person present at the sale of a horse asserts
that he was his horse, and that he knows him to be sound and sure-footed,
when in fact the horse is neither the one nor the other; according
to the principle contended for by the plaintiffs, an action lies
against the person present as well as the seller, and the purchaser has
two securities. And even in this very case, if the action lies, the plaintiffs
will stand in a peculiarly fortunate predicament, for they will then
have the responsibility both of Falch and the defendant. And they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>will be in a better situation than they would have been if, in the conversation
that passed between them and the defendant, instead of
asserting that Falch might safely be trusted, the defendant had said,
“If he do not pay for the goods, I will;” for then undoubtedly an
action would not have lain against the defendant. Other and stronger
cases may be put of actions that must necessarily spring out of any
principle upon which this can be supported, and yet which were never
thought of till the present action was brought. Upon what principle is
this act said to be an injury? The plaintiffs say, on the ground that,
when the question was asked, the defendant was bound to tell the
truth. There are cases, I admit, where a man is bound not to misrepresent,
but to tell the truth; but no such case has been cited,
except in the case of contracts; and all the cases of deceit for misinformation
may, it seems to me, be turned into actions of assumpsit.
And so far from a person being bound in a case like the present to tell
the truth, the books supply me with a variety of cases, in which even
the contracting party is not liable for a misrepresentation. There are
cases of two sorts in which, though a man is deceived, he can maintain
no action. The first class of cases (though not analogous to the present)
is where the affirmation is that the thing sold has not a defect
which is a visible one; there the imposition, the fraudulent intent, is
admitted, but it is no tort. The second head of cases is where the
affirmation is (what is called in some of the books) a nude assertion,
such as the party deceived may exercise his own judgment upon; as
where it is matter of opinion, where he may make inquiries into the
truth of the assertion, and it becomes his own fault from laches that
he is deceived. 1 Roll. Abr. 101; Yelv. 20; 1 Sid. 146; Cro. Jac. 386;
Bayly <em>v.</em> Merrel. In Harvey <em>v.</em> Young, Yelv. 20, J. S., who had a term
for years, affirmed to J. D. that the term was worth £150 to be sold,
upon which J. D. gave £150, and afterwards could not get more than
£100 for it, and then brought his action; and it was alleged that this
matter did not prove any fraud, for it was only a naked assertion that
the term was worth so much, and it was the plaintiff’s folly to give
credit to such assertion. But if the defendant had warranted the
term to be of such a value to be sold, and upon that the plaintiff had
bought it, it would have been otherwise; for the warranty given by
the defendant is a matter to induce confidence and trust in the plaintiff.
This case, and the passage in 1 Roll. Abr. 101, are recognized in
1 Sid. 146. How, then, are the cases? None exist in which such an
action as the present has been brought; none, in which any principle
applicable to the present case has been laid down to prove that it will
lie; not even a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictum</span></i>. But from the cases cited some principles may
be extracted to show that it cannot be sustained: 1st. That what is
fraud, which will support an action, is matter of law. 2d. That in
every case of a fraudulent misrepresentation, attended with damage,
an action will not lie even between contracting parties. 3d. That if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>the assertion be a nude assertion, it is that sort of misrepresentation
the truth of which does not lie merely in the knowledge of the defendant,
but may be inquired into, and the plaintiff is bound so to do;
and he cannot recover a damage which he has suffered by his laches.
Then let us consider how far the facts of the case come within the last
of these principles. The misrepresentation stated in the declaration
is respecting the credit of Falch; the defendant asserted that the plaintiffs
might safely give him credit; but credit to which a man is entitled
is matter of judgment and opinion, on which different men
might form different opinions, and upon which the plaintiffs might
form their own, to mislead which no fact to prove the good credit of
Falch is falsely asserted. It seems to me, therefore, that any assertion
relative to credit, especially where the party making it has no interest,
nor is in any collusion with the person respecting whose credit
the assertion is made, is like the case in Yelverton respecting the value
of the term. But at any rate, it is not an assertion of a fact peculiarly
in the knowledge of the defendant. Whether Falch deserved credit
depended on the opinion of many; for credit exists on the good opinion
of many. Respecting this the plaintiffs might have inquired of others
who knew as much as the defendant; it was their fault that they did
not, and they have suffered damage by their own laches. It was owing
to their own gross negligence that they gave credence to the assertion
of the defendant, without taking pains to satisfy themselves that that
assertion was founded in fact, as in the case of Bayly <em>v.</em> Merrel. I am,
therefore, of opinion that this action is as novel in principle as it is in
precedent, that it is against the principles to be collected from analogous
cases, and consequently that it cannot be maintained.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Buller, J.</span> The foundation of this action is fraud and deceit in the
defendant, and damage to the plaintiffs. And a question is, whether
an action thus founded can be sustained in a court of law. Fraud
without damage, or damage without fraud, gives no cause of action;
but where these two concur, an action lies. Per Croke, J., 3 Bulst. 95.
But it is contended that this was a bare, naked lie; that, as no collusion
with Falch is charged, it does not amount to a fraud; and, if there
were any fraud, the nature of it is not stated. And it was supposed
by the counsel, who originally made the motion, that no action could
be maintained unless the defendant, who made this false assertion, had
an interest in so doing. I agree that an action cannot be supported for
telling a bare, naked lie; but that I define to be, saying a thing which
is false, knowing or not knowing it to be so, and without any design to
injure, cheat, or deceive another person. Every deceit comprehends a
lie; but a deceit is more than a lie, on account of the view with which
it is practised, its being coupled with some dealing, and the injury
which it is calculated to occasion, and does occasion, to another person.
Deceit is a very extensive head in the law; and it will be proper
to take a short view of some of the cases which have existed on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>subject, to see how far the Courts have gone, and what are the principles
upon which they have decided. I lay out of the question the
case in 2 Cro. 196, and all other cases which relate to freehold interests
in lands; for they go on the special reason that the seller cannot have
them without title, and the buyer is at his peril to see it. But the cases
cited on the part of the defendant deserving notice are Yelv. 20, Carth.
90, Salk. 210. The first of these has been fully stated by my brother
Grose; but it is to be observed that the book does not affect to give
the reasons on which the Court delivered their judgment; but it is a
case quoted by counsel at the bar, who mentions what was alleged by
counsel in the other case. If the Court went on a distinction between
the words “warranty” and “affirmation,” the case is not law; for it
was rightly held by Holt, C. J., in the subsequent cases, and has been
uniformly adopted ever since, that an affirmation at the time of a sale
is a warranty, provided it appear on evidence to have been so intended.
But the true ground of that determination was that the assertion was
of mere matter of judgment and opinion; of a matter of which the
defendant had no particular knowledge, but of which many men will
be of many minds, and which is often governed by whim and caprice.
Judgment, or opinion, in such case implies no knowledge. And here
this case differs materially from that in Yelverton; my brother Grose
considers this assertion as mere matter of opinion only, but I differ
from him in that respect. For it is stated on this record that the defendant
knew that the fact was false. The case in Yelverton admits
that, if there had been fraud, it would have been otherwise. The case
of Crosse <em>v.</em> Gardner, Carth. 90, was upon an affirmation that oxen
which the defendant had in his possession and sold to the plaintiff were
his, when in truth they belonged to another person. The objection
against the action was that the declaration neither stated that the defendant
deceitfully sold them, or that he knew them to be the property
of another person; and a man may be mistaken in his property and
right to a thing without any fraud or ill intent. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex concessis</span></i> therefore
if there were fraud or deceit, the action would lie; and knowledge of
the falsehood of the thing asserted is fraud and deceit. But, notwithstanding
these objections, the Court held that the action lay, because
the plaintiff had no means of knowing to whom the property belonged
but only by the possession. And in Cro. Jac. 474, it was held that
affirming them to be his, knowing them to be a stranger’s, is the offence
and cause of action. The case of Medina <em>v.</em> Stoughton, Salk. 210, in
the point of decision, is the same as Crosse <em>v.</em> Gardner; but there is an
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiter dictum</span></i> of Holt, C. J., that where the seller of a personal thing is
out of possession, it is otherwise; for there may be room to question
the seller’s title, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caveat emptor</span></i> in such case to have an express warranty
or a good title. This distinction by Holt is not mentioned by
Lord Raym. 593, who reports the same case; and if an affirmation at
the time of sale be a warranty, I cannot feel a distinction between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>vendor’s being in or out of possession. The thing is bought of him,
and in consequence of his assertion; and if there be any difference, it
seems to me that the case is strongest against the vendor when he is
out of possession, because then the vendee has nothing but the warranty
to rely on. These cases, then, are so far from being authorities
against the present action, that they show that if there be fraud or
deceit, the action will lie; and that knowledge of the falsehood of the
thing asserted is fraud and deceit. Collusion, then, is not necessary to
constitute fraud. In the case of a conspiracy, there must be a collusion
between two or more to support an indictment; but if one man alone
be guilty of an offence which, if practised by two, would be the subject
of an indictment for a conspiracy, he is civilly liable in an action for
reparation of damages at the suit of the person injured. That knowledge
of the falsehood of the thing asserted constitutes fraud, though
there be no collusion, is further proved by the case of Risney <em>v.</em> Selby,
Salk. 211, where, upon a treaty for the purchase of a house, the defendant
fraudulently affirmed that the rent was £30 per annum, when
it was only £20 per annum, and the plaintiff had his judgment; for the
value of the rent is a matter which lies in the private knowledge of the
landlord and tenant; and if they affirm the rent to be more than it is,
the purchaser is cheated, and ought to have a remedy for it. No collusion
was there stated; nor does it appear that the tenant was ever
asked a question about the rent, and yet the purchaser might have
applied to him for information; but the judgment proceeded wholly
upon the ground that the defendant knew that what he asserted was
false. And, by the words of the book, it seems that if the tenant had
said the same thing he also would have been liable to an action. If so,
that would be an answer to the objection that the defendant in this
case had no interest in the assertion which he made. But I shall not
leave this point on the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictum</span></i> or inference which may be collected from
that case. If A., by fraud and deceit, cheat B. out of £1,000, it makes
no difference to B. whether A. or any other person pockets that
£1,000. He has lost his money; and if he can fix fraud upon A., reason
seems to say that he has a right to seek satisfaction against him.
Authorities are not wanting on this point. 1 Roll. Abr. 91, pl. 7. If
the vendor affirm that the goods are the goods of a stranger, his friend,
and that he had authority from him to sell them, and upon that B.
buys them, when in truth they are the goods of another, yet, if he sell
them fraudulently and falsely on this pretence of authority, though he
do not warrant them, and though it be not averred that he sold them
knowing them to be the goods of the stranger, yet B. shall have an
action for this deceit. It is not clear from this case whether the fraud
consisted in having no authority from his friend, or in knowing that
the goods belonged to another person; what is said at the end of the
case only proves that “falsely” and “fraudulently” are equivalent to
“knowingly.” If the first were the fact in the case, namely, that he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>no authority, the case does not apply to this point; but if he had an
authority from his friend, whatever the goods were sold for his friend
was entitled to, and he had no interest in them. But, however that
might be, the next case admits of no doubt. For in 1 Roll. Abr. 100,
pl. 1, it was held that if a man acknowledge a fine in my name, or acknowledge
a judgment in an action in my name of my land, this shall
bind me forever; and therefore I may have a writ of deceit against him
who acknowledged it. So if a man acknowledge a recognizance, statute-merchant
or staple, there is no foundation for supposing that in
that case the person acknowledging the fine or judgment was the same
person to whom it was so acknowledged. If that had been necessary it
would have been so stated; but if it were not so, he who acknowledged
the fine had no interest in it. Again, in 1 Roll. Abr. 95, l. 25, it is
said, “If my servant lease my land to another for years, reserving a
rent for me, and, to persuade the lessee to accept it, he promise that he
shall enjoy the land without incumbrances, if the land be incumbered,
&amp;c., the lessee may have an action on the case against my servant, because
he made an express warranty.” Here, then, is a case in which
the party had no interest whatever. The same case is reported in Cro.
Jac. 425; but no notice is taken of this point, probably because the
reporter thought it immaterial whether the warranty be by the master
or servant. And if the warranty be made at the time of the sale, or
before the sale, and the sale is upon the faith of the warranty, I can see
no distinction between the cases. The gist of the action is fraud and
deceit; and if that fraud and deceit can be fixed by evidence on one
who had no interest in his iniquity, it proves his malice to be the
greater. But it was objected to this declaration that if there were any
fraud, the nature of it is not stated. To this the declaration itself is
so direct an answer that the case admits of no other. The fraud is that
the defendant procured the plaintiffs to sell goods on credit to one
whom they would not otherwise have trusted, by asserting that which
he knew to be false. Here, then, is the fraud and the means by which
it was committed; and it was done with a view to enrich Falch by impoverishing
the plaintiffs, or, in other words, by cheating the plaintiffs
out of their goods. The cases which I have stated, and Sid. 146, and 1
Keb. 522, prove that the declaration states more than is necessary; for
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fraudulenter</span></i> without sciens, or sciens without <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fraudulenter</span></i>, would be
sufficient to support the action. But, as Mr. J. Twisden said in that
case, the fraud must be proved. The assertion alone will not maintain
the action; but the plaintiff must go on to prove that it was false, and
that the defendant knew it to be so; by what means that proof is to be
made out in evidence need not be stated in the declaration. Some general
arguments were urged at the bar to show that mischiefs and inconveniences
would arise if this action were sustained; for if a man
who is asked a question respecting another’s responsibility hesitate or
is silent, he blasts the character of the tradesman; and if he say that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>he is insolvent, he may not be able to prove it. But let us see what
is contended for: it is nothing less than that a man may assert that
which he knows to be false, and thereby do an everlasting injury to his
neighbor, and yet not be answerable for it. This is as repugnant to
law as it is to morality. Then it is said that the plaintiffs had no right
to ask the question of the defendant. But I do not agree in that; for
the plaintiffs had an interest in knowing what the credit of Falch was.
It was not the inquiry of idle curiosity, but it was to govern a very
extensive concern. The defendant undoubtedly had his option to give
an answer to the question or not; but if he gave none, or said he did
not know, it is impossible for any court of justice to adopt the possible
inferences of a suspicious mind as a ground for grave judgment. All
that is required of a person in the defendant’s situation is that he shall
give no answer, or that, if he do, he shall answer according to the
truth as far as he knows. The reasoning in the case of Coggs <em>v.</em> Barnard,
which was cited by the plaintiff’s counsel, is, I think, very applicable
to this part of the case. If the answer import insolvency, it is
not necessary that the defendant should be able to prove that insolvency
to a jury; for the law protects a man in giving that answer, if
he does it in confidence and without malice. No action can be maintained
against him for giving such an answer, unless express malice can
be proved. From the circumstance of the law giving that protection,
it seems to follow, as a necessary consequence, that the law not only
gives sanction to the question, but requires that, if it be answered at
all, it shall be answered honestly. There is a case in the books which,
though not much to be relied on, yet serves to show that this kind of
conduct has never been thought innocent in Westminster Hall. In R.
<em>v.</em> Gunston, 1 Str. 589, the defendant was indicted for pretending that
a person of no reputation was Sir J. Thornycraft, whereby the prosecutor
was induced to trust him; and the Court refused to grant a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">certiorari</span></i>,
unless a special ground were laid for it. If the assertion in that
case had been wholly innocent the Court would not have hesitated a
moment. How, indeed, an indictment could be maintained for that I
do not well understand; nor have I learnt what became of it. The
objection to the indictment is that it was merely a private injury: but
that is no answer to an action. And if a man will wickedly assert that
which he knows to be false, and thereby draws his neighbor into a
heavy loss, even though it be under the specious pretence of serving
his friend, I say <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ausis talibus istis non jura subserviunt</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Ashhurst, J.</span> The objection in this case, which is to the third count
in the declaration, is that it contains only a bare assertion, and does
not state that the defendant had any interest, or that he colluded with
the other party who had. But I am of opinion that the action lies notwithstanding
this objection. It seems to me that the rule laid down by
Croke, J., in Bayly <em>v.</em> Merrel, 3 Bulstr. 95, is a sound and solid principle,
namely, that fraud without damage, or damage without fraud,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>will not found an action; but where both concur an action will lie.
The principle is not denied by the other judges, but only the application
of it, because the party injured there, who was the carrier, had the
means of attaining certain knowledge in his own power, namely, by
weighing the goods; and therefore it was a foolish credulity, against
which the law will not relieve. But that is not the case here, for it is
expressly charged that the defendant knew the falsity of the allegation,
and which the jury have found to be true; but <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non constat</span></i> that the
plaintiffs knew it, or had any means of knowing it, but trusted to
the veracity of the defendant. And many reasons may occur why the
defendant might know that fact better than the plaintiffs; as if there
had before this event subsisted a partnership between him and Falch
which had been dissolved; but at any rate it is stated as a fact that
he knew it. It is admitted that a fraudulent affirmation, when the
party making it has an interest, is a ground of action, as in Risney <em>v.</em>
Selby, which was a false affirmation made to a purchaser as to the
rent of a farm which the defendant was in treaty to sell to him. But
it was argued that the action lies not unless where the party making it
has an interest, or colludes with one who has. I do not recollect that
any case was cited which proves such a position; but if there were
any such to be found, I should not hesitate to say that it could not be
law, for I have so great a veneration for the law as to suppose that
nothing can be law which is not founded in common sense or common
honesty. For the gist of the action is the injury done to the plaintiff,
and not whether the defendant meant to be a gainer by it; what is it
to the plaintiff whether the defendant was or was not to gain by it? the
injury to him is the same. And it should seem that it ought more
emphatically to lie against him, as the malice is more diabolical if he
had not the temptation of gain. For the same reason, it cannot be
necessary that the defendant should collude with one who has an interest.
But if collusion were necessary, there seems all the reason in the
world to suppose both interest and collusion from the nature of the
act; for it is to be hoped that there is not to be found a disposition so
diabolical as to prompt any man to injure another without benefiting
himself. But it is said that if this be determined to be law, any man
may have an action brought against him for telling a lie, by the crediting
of which another happens eventually to be injured. But this consequence
by no means follows; for in order to make it actionable it
must be accompanied with the circumstances averred in this count,
namely, that the defendant, “intending to deceive and defraud the
plaintiffs, did deceitfully encourage and persuade them to do the act,
and for that purpose made the false affirmation, in consequence of
which they did the act.” Any lie accompanied with those circumstances
I should clearly hold to be the subject of an action; but not a
mere lie thrown out at random without any intention of hurting anybody,
but which some person was foolish enough to act upon; for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo animo</span></i> is a great part of the gist of the action. Another argument
which has been made use of is, that this is a new case, and that there is
no precedent of such an action. Where cases are new in their principle,
there I admit that it is necessary to have recourse to legislative interposition
in order to remedy the grievance; but where the case is only
new in the instance, and the only question is upon the application of a
principle recognized in the law to such new case, it will be just as competent
to courts of justice to apply the principle to any case which may
arise two centuries hence, as it was two centuries ago; if it were not,
we ought to blot out of our law-books one fourth part of the cases that
are to be found in them. The same objection might, in my opinion,
have been made with much greater reason in the case of Coggs <em>v.</em>
Barnard; for there the defendant, so far from meaning an injury,
meant a kindness, though he was not so careful as he should have been
in the execution of what he undertook. And indeed the principle of
the case does not, in my opinion, seem so clear as that of the case now
before us, and yet that case has always been received as law. Indeed,
one great reason, perhaps, why this action has never occurred may be
that it is not likely that such a species of fraud should be practised
unless the party is in some way interested. Therefore I think the rule
for arresting the judgment ought to be discharged.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Kenyon, C. J.</span> I am not desirous of entering very fully into
the discussion of this subject, as the argument comes to me quite
exhausted by what has been said by my brothers. But still I will say
a few words as to the grounds upon which my opinion is formed. All
laws stand on the best and broadest basis which go to enforce moral
and social duties. Though, indeed, it is not every moral and social
duty the neglect of which is the ground of an action. For there are,
which are called in the civil law, duties of imperfect obligation, for the
enforcing of which no action lies. There are many cases where the pure
effusion of a good mind may induce the performance of particular
duties, which yet cannot be enforced by municipal laws. But there are
certain duties, the non-performance of which the jurisprudence of this
country has made the subject of a civil action. And I find it laid down
by the Lord Ch. B. Comyns (Com. Dig. tit. Action upon the Case for a
Deceit, A. 1), that “an action upon the case for a deceit lies when a
man does any deceit to the damage of another.” He has not, indeed,
cited any authority for his opinion; but his opinion alone is of great
authority, since he was considered by his contemporaries as the most
able lawyer in Westminster Hall. Let us, however, consider whether
that proposition is not supported by the invariable principle in all the
cases on this subject. In 3 Bulstr. 95, it was held by Croke, J., that
“fraud without damage, or damage without fraud, gives no cause of
action; but where these two do concur, there an action lieth.” It is
true, as has been already observed, that the judges were of opinion in
that case that the action did not lie on other grounds. But consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>what those grounds were. Dodderidge, J., said: “If we shall give way
to this, then every carrier would have an action upon the case; but he
shall not have any action for this, because it is merely his own default
that he did not weigh it.” Undoubtedly, where the common prudence
and caution of man are sufficient to guard him, the law will not protect
him in his negligence. And in that case, as reported in Cro. Jac. 386,
the negligence of the plaintiff himself was the cause for which the
Court held that the action was not maintainable. Then, how does the
principle of that case apply to the present? There are many situations
in life, and particularly in the commercial world, where a man cannot
by any diligence inform himself of the degree of credit which ought to
be given to the persons with whom he deals; in which cases he must
apply to those whose sources of intelligence enable them to give that
information. The law of prudence leads him to apply to them; and
the law of morality ought to induce them to give the information required.
In the case of Bulstrode, the carrier might have weighed the
goods himself; but in this case the plaintiffs had no means of knowing
the state of Falch’s credit but by an application to his neighbors. The
same observation may be made to the cases cited by the defendant’s
counsel respecting titles to real property. For a person does not have
recourse to common conversation to know the title of an estate which
he is about to purchase; but he may inspect the title-deeds; and he
does not use common prudence if he rely on any other security. In the
case of Bulstrode, the Court seemed to consider that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum</span></i> and
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">injuria</span></i> are the grounds of this action; and they all admitted that, if
they had existed in that case, the action would have lain there; for
the rest of the judges did not controvert the opinion of Croke, J., but
denied the application of it to that particular case. Then it was contended
here that the action cannot be maintained for telling a naked
lie; but that proposition is to be taken <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub modo</span></i>. If, indeed, no
injury is occasioned by the lie it is not actionable; but if it be attended
with a damage, it then becomes the subject of an action. As calling a
woman a whore, if she sustain no damage by it, is not actionable; but
if she lose her marriage by it, then she may recover satisfaction in
damages. But in this case the two grounds of the action concur; here
are both the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum et injuria</span></i>. The plaintiffs applied to the defendant,
telling him that they were going to deal with Falch, and desiring
to be informed of his credit, when the defendant fraudulently, and
knowing it to be otherwise, and with a design to deceive the plaintiffs,
made the false assertion which is stated on the record, by which they
sustained a considerable damage. Then, can a doubt be entertained
for a moment but that this is injurious to the plaintiffs? If this be not
an injury, I do not know how to define the word. Then, as to the loss;
this is stated in the declaration, and found by the verdict. Several of
the words stated in this declaration, and particularly <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fraudulenter</span></i>, did
not occur in several of the cases cited. It is admitted that the defendant’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>conduct was highly immoral and detrimental to society. And I
am of opinion that the action is maintainable on the grounds of deceit
in the defendant, and injury and loss to the plaintiffs.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>WORK <em>v.</em> CAMPBELL<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, California, December 13, 1912.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 164 California Reports, 343.</em></h4>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Angellotti, J.</span><a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c015'><sup>[315]</sup></a> The action is one to recover of defendant fifteen thousand
dollars’ damages alleged to have been caused plaintiff by reason of the fact
that she has become finally separated from her husband, L. B. Work, and has
thereby suffered and will continue to suffer great distress of mind and mental
anguish, and has lost and will continue to lose forever his society, comfort,
love, and affection, as well as the support and maintenance which he would
give her. On or about February 15, 1910, the husband “separated from
plaintiff, and from their said children, and departed from the said county of
Kings, and has gone to parts unknown to plaintiff with intent to desert and
abandon plaintiff.” It is not alleged that defendant, who is the husband of
an aunt of plaintiff, ever said or did anything to influence the husband to
leave plaintiff, or to cause any change of feeling on his part toward her. It
is frankly alleged that his departure was caused solely by the fact that she
became very angry with him, refused to see him, refused to speak or talk
with him, sent him a letter in which she told him that she would hold no
further communication with him, but would sue him for a divorce and that
she hoped she might never see or speak to him again. Her complaint characterizes
her conduct toward her husband, alleged to be the sole inducement
for his departure, as “harsh and cruel treatment” of him. The claim of any
liability on the part of defendant to her on account of the separation is based
on allegations to the effect that her attitude and conduct toward her husband,
which caused the separation, were wholly induced by certain false statements
knowingly made to her by defendant concerning her husband, which, owing to
her confidence and trust in defendant, she fully believed and relied upon, and
certain advice and counsel given to her by defendant in the matter, all of
which statements and advice were wilfully made and given by defendant with
the intent and design on his part to cause a separation between plaintiff and
her husband. The complaint alleges in detail the alleged statements and
advice of defendant in this behalf, and also the object sought to be obtained
by him in causing a separation of the husband and wife, but no useful purpose
can be subserved by stating these things here. It further alleges that when
she discovered the falsity of the representations and the intent and purpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>of defendant in making them, she at once instituted diligent search for her
husband, but has been unable to ascertain his whereabouts. It is further alleged
“that by reason of the premises hereinabove stated, defendant has unlawfully,
fraudulently and wrongfully abducted and enticed from the plaintiff
her said husband, and that by reason of the said abduction, this plaintiff has
suffered,” &amp;c., to her great damage in the sum of fifteen thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='c019'>Under our statutes, a wife may maintain an action for damages suffered
by her by reason of the abduction or enticement from her of her husband, as
may a husband for the damages suffered by him for the abduction or enticement
from him of his wife, and in such an action by the wife her husband is
not a necessary party plaintiff. (See Civ. Code, sec. 49, subds. 1 and 2;
Humphrey <em>v.</em> Pope, 122 Cal. 253 [54 Pac. 847].) It may be assumed, purely
for the purposes of this decision, that no cause of action for the abduction
or enticement of her husband from her is stated by the wife in her complaint....</p>

<p class='c019'>We can see no reason why, regardless of the question we have just referred
to, the matters alleged in the complaint do not show a cause of action in behalf
of plaintiff against defendant. According to the complaint, the sole cause
of the conduct of plaintiff causing the separation of the husband and wife,
with the same injurious consequences to her that would have followed the
abduction or enticement of her husband from her, was the action of defendant
in making to her the wilfully false representations concerning her husband,
for the very purpose and with the design on his part to so influence her as to
bring about such a separation. His deception in the matter was the sole cause
of such conduct on her part, and such conduct on her part was tantamount to
a refusal by her to continue the relation between her husband and herself of
husband and wife. It is declared in section 1708 of the Civil Code that
“every person is bound, without contract, to abstain from injuring the person
or property of another, or infringing upon any of his rights,” and in section
1709, “one who wilfully deceives another with intent to induce him to alter
his position to his injury or risk, is liable for any damage which he thereby
suffers.” These are but statements of the well settled law independent of
statute. It is substantially said in 20 Cyc. at page 10, and the statement is
well supported by the authorities, that as a general rule, an action for damages
for deceit will lie wherever a party has made a false representation of a
material fact susceptible of knowledge knowing it to be false or not having
sufficient knowledge on the subject to warrant the representation, with the
intent to induce the person to whom it is made, in reliance upon it, to do or
refrain from doing something to his pecuniary hurt, when such person, acting
with reasonable prudence, is thereby deceived and induced to so do or refrain,
to his damage. No reason is apparent to us why the alleged facts set forth in
the complaint should not be held to bring the case within the operation of this
rule.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is no answer to such an action that the action or conduct of the plaintiff
is the direct cause of the result occasioning damages. Such is the situation
wherever such an action is allowed. The whole basis of the action is that
such act or conduct is fraudulently induced by the defendant. A is wilfully
deceived by B into selling goods to C upon credit, by false representations as
to C’s solvency wilfully and knowingly made by B to A for the very purpose
of inducing him to so do and thereby suffers a pecuniary injury. The direct
and immediate cause of the injury is, of course, the sale by A to C on credit.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>But B is held liable to A for the damage thereby suffered because by fraud he
induced A to make such sale on credit.</p>

<p class='c019'>It may be urged that a person fraudulently misled cannot found his claim
on conduct violative of sound morals or public policy, or of a criminal statute.
Here the conduct and attitude of the wife causing the separation was her
harsh and cruel conduct toward her husband, her refusal to live with him or
to see him, her refusal to further continue the relationship of husband and
wife, &amp;c. Of course, all her conduct would have been fully justified if the
representations made to her by defendant had been true in point of fact, as
the complaint sufficiently alleges that plaintiff believed to be the situation.
It has been held that where the fraudulent representation is intended to
create and actually does create in the mind of the party a belief that under
the circumstances represented the act which he is induced to do is neither
illegal nor immoral, he may recover the damages he has sustained even though
a statute makes the act a criminal offence. (See 20 Cyc. 80; Burrows <em>v.</em>
Rhodes, [1899] 1 Q. B. 816; Prescott <em>v.</em> Norris, 32 N. H. 101; Morrill <em>v.</em>
Palmer, 68 Vt. 1 [33 L. R. A. 411, 33 Atl. 829].) We are not called upon to
go as far as this in this case. The complaint indicates no criminal offence on
plaintiff’s part. Certainly, however, under the circumstances stated, it cannot
fairly be said that plaintiff did not believe her conduct toward her husband
to be in full accord with good morals and public policy, or was not
justified in so believing. It is not claimed that the complaint does not sufficiently
show that plaintiff acted with reasonable prudence in accepting as
true and relying on defendant’s statements. In view of the circumstances
alleged as to her relationship to defendant, and her confidence and trust in
him, we think the complaint is not fatally defective in this regard, although
it must be conceded to be somewhat remarkable that a wife having any affection
for or confidence in her husband should be willing to accept as true such
statements as are here alleged to have been made to her, without making some
further inquiry.</p>

<p class='c019'>We have not found any case in which the remedy of action for damages for
deceit has been invoked under such circumstances as appear here. The fact
that the case presented is unique in its circumstances is not, however, any
warrant for a refusal to apply a rule that appears, on principle, to be applicable.
We think the facts confessed by the demurrer show a liability on the
part of defendant to plaintiff for any damage caused her by the loss of her
husband.<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c015'><sup>[316]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c013'>STATE <em>v.</em> GORDON<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Kansas, July Term, 1895.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 56 Kansas Reports, 64.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Gordon was convicted and sentenced in the District Court upon a
charge of obtaining money from Trenier on false pretences. He appealed
from the judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts alleged and proved were, in brief, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Gordon represented to Trenier that Gordon and a certain Indian
owned and possessed a gold brick of the value of $10,000; that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>were about to take the brick to the United States Mint at Philadelphia
to be coined into money; that the Indian would not allow the
brick to be taken to the mint unless he received a certain sum of money
on his interest in the brick. Gordon told Trenier that, if Trenier would
give Gordon money to pay the Indian on his share in the brick, he
(Gordon) would deliver said brick to Trenier to be by Trenier taken
to the mint, and that Trenier should have a third interest in the money
coined from the brick. Relying on these statements, Trenier gave
Gordon money to pay the Indian.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appeared that Gordon and the Indian did not own or possess
a gold brick; that the representations were all known by Gordon to
be false; and that they were made for the purpose of defrauding
Trenier.<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c015'><sup>[317]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Johnston, J.</span>... The substantial features of the charge were representations
and assurances of present existing facts, viz., that Gordon
and the Indian were then the owners and possessors of a valuable gold
brick, which they then had in Shawnee County, and that they were
then on their road to take the gold brick to the United States Mint
at Philadelphia to be coined. It is alleged that on the faith of these
representations and the assurance of those facts the money was obtained
from Trenier. The mere fact that a false pretence of an existing
or past fact is accompanied by a future promise will not relieve
the defendant or take the case out of the operation of the statute.
Besides,</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not necessary, to constitute the offence of obtaining goods by
false pretences, that the owner has been induced to part with his property
solely and entirely by pretences which are false; nor need the
pretences be the paramount cause of the delivery to the prisoner. It
is sufficient if they are a part of the moving cause, and without
them the defrauded party would not have parted with the property.”

</div>

<p class='c014'>Action against Fitzmaurice <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et als.</span></i>, directors of the Army and Navy
Provision Market (Limited), and against Hunt, the secretary, and
Hanley, the manager, asking for the repayment by them of a sum of
£1500 advanced by the plaintiff on debentures of the company, on the
ground that he was induced to advance the money by the fraudulent
misrepresentations of the defendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plaintiff, who was a shareholder in the company, received a prospectus
issued by order of the directors, inviting subscription for
debenture bonds. This prospectus contained the following statement
as to the objects for which the issue of debentures was made:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. To enable the society to complete the present alterations and
additions to the buildings, and to purchase their own horses and vans,
whereby a large saving will be effected in the cost of transport.</p>

<p class='c007'>“2. To further develop the arrangements at present existing for
the direct supply of cheap fish from the coast, which are still in their
infancy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Plaintiff took debenture bonds to the amount of £1500; and testified
that he relied, as one inducement, on the fact that the company
wanted the money for the objects stated in the prospectus.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the hearing before Denman, J., the plaintiff contended and offered
evidence tending to show that the real object of the directors in
issuing the debentures was to pay off pressing liabilities of the company,
and not to complete the buildings or to purchase horses and
vans, or to develop the business of the company.<a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c015'><sup>[319]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><em>Davey</em>, Q. C., <em>W. W. Karslake</em>, Q. C., and <em>J. Kaye</em>, for Fitzmaurice.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>There was no misrepresentation of any fact, and the directors
merely stated their intention as to the money, which of course they
might alter. There is every difference between the two: Maddison <em>v.</em>
Alderson, 8 App. Cases, 467. Unless it amounts to a contract, a
mere statement that you will do something is of no effect: Jordan <em>v.</em>
Money, 5 H. L. C. 185; and if it was a contract then it was with the
company, and the directors cannot be sued: Ferguson <em>v.</em> Wilson, L. R.
2 Chan. 77.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Sir F. Herschell</em>, in reply. An allegation of intention may be fraudulent:
Ex parte Whittaker, L. R. 10 Chan. 446.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Denman, J., delivered an elaborate opinion, substantially sustaining
the plaintiff’s contention. He gave judgment against the
directors.]</p>

<p class='c007'>From this judgment, Fitzmaurice and the four other directors
appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bowen, L. J.</span> [After stating the requisites of an action for deceit,
and commenting upon other alleged misrepresentations.] But when
we come to the third alleged misstatement I feel that the plaintiff’s
case is made out. I mean the statement of the objects for which the
money was to be raised. These were stated to be to complete the
alterations and additions to the buildings, to purchase horses and vans,
and to develop the supply of fish. A mere suggestion of possible purposes
to which a portion of the money might be applied would not have
formed a basis for an action of deceit. There must be a misstatement
of an existing fact; but the state of a man’s mind is as much a fact as
the state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove
what the state of a man’s mind at a particular time is, but if it can be
ascertained it is as much a fact as anything else. A misrepresentation
as to the state of a man’s mind is, therefore, a misstatement of fact.
Having applied as careful consideration to the evidence as I could, I
have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the true objects of the defendants
in raising the money were not those stated in the circular. I
will not go through the evidence, but looking only to the cross-examination
of the defendants, I am satisfied that the objects for which the
loan was wanted were misstated by the defendants, I will not say
knowingly, but so recklessly as to be fraudulent in the eye of the
law.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the question remains: Did this misstatement contribute to
induce the plaintiff to advance his money. Mr. Davey’s argument has
not convinced me that they did not. He contended that the plaintiff
admits that he would not have taken the debentures unless he had
thought they would give him a charge on the property, and therefore
he was induced to take them by his own mistake, and the misstatement
in the circular was not material. But such misstatement was
material if it was actively present to his mind when he decided to advance
his money. The real question is, what was the state of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>plaintiff’s mind, and if his mind was disturbed by the misstatement of
the defendants, and such disturbance was in part the cause of what he
did, the mere fact of his also making a mistake himself could make no
difference. It resolves itself into a mere question of fact. I have felt
some difficulty about the pleadings, because in the statement of claim
this point is not clearly put forward, and I had some doubt whether
this contention as to the third misstatement was not an afterthought.
But the balance of my judgment is weighed down by the probability of
the case. What is the first question which a man asks when he advances
money? It is, what is it wanted for? Therefore I think that
the statement is material, and that the plaintiff would be unlike the
rest of his race if he was not influenced by the statement of the objects
for which the loan was required. The learned judge in the Court
below came to the conclusion that the misstatement did influence him,
and I think he came to a right conclusion.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>GALLAGHER <em>v.</em> BRUNEL<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New York, August, 1826.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 6 Cowen, 347.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>On demurrer to the declaration. The first count stated, that on the
9th of April, 1823, Castro &amp; Henriques proposed to purchase of the
plaintiffs a quantity of cotton, at a certain price; part to be paid in
cash, and part to be secured by the promissory note of the purchasers
endorsed by the defendant, at four months; that C. &amp; H. were then
unable to pay for the cotton; and the plaintiffs therefore unwilling to
sell all, or any part, on their sole credit; and the defendant knew this.
Yet, contriving and intending to injure and defraud the plaintiffs; and
to induce them to sell and deliver the cotton to C. &amp; H.; and thereby
subject the plaintiffs to the loss of the balance due after the cash payment,
the defendant falsely and deceitfully represented and held out
to the plaintiffs, that he, the defendant, was willing to endorse the
proposed note; and with the like intent, &amp;c., falsely, fraudulently,
and deceitfully encouraged and induced the plaintiffs to sell and deliver
the cotton. That they did sell and deliver it, in confidence of
such false, fraudulent and deceitful representation, &amp;c., when, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>truth, the defendant was then not willing, and did not mean or intend
to endorse the note, or make himself responsible; nor did he then, nor
had he at any time since endorsed, or made himself legally responsible.
By means whereof the plaintiffs lost the cotton and the price.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second count averred, that C. &amp; H. were in bad credit and unfit
to be trusted, at the time of the sale. But the defendant, well knowing
this; and contriving and intending to defraud and injure the plaintiffs,
and wrongfully and deceitfully to enable C. &amp; H. to obtain the possession
of the cotton, and convert it to their own use, without paying
the plaintiffs for it; falsely, fraudulently and deceitfully represented
to the plaintiffs, and gave them to understand and believe, that, in
case they would sell the cotton to C. &amp; H., the defendant would become
answerable to the plaintiffs, for so much as should be unpaid, by
endorsing the note or notes of C. &amp; H., &amp;c.; that without such representation,
they would not have sold the cotton, &amp;c. (<em>In other respects,
this count was substantially the same as the first.</em>)</p>

<p class='c007'>General demurrer and joinder.<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c015'><sup>[321]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Woodworth, J.</span>... The attempt here is, to sustain the action,
not on a contract, which, if in writing, might perhaps be obligatory;
but on a deceitful representation. If the promise was in writing, I perceive
no objection to its validity, inasmuch as a good consideration is
stated, viz., that if the plaintiffs would sell and deliver, the defendant
would endorse. If, then, there is a binding contract existing between
the parties, and on which the defendant is liable, I apprehend it is not
competent for the plaintiffs to say they have an election to turn this
into an action for deceit, and recover in that form, unless the case is
such as to render the party liable, not only on the contract; but in
addition, contains facts sufficient to sustain an action for deceit. For
example, suppose A represents B to be solvent, knowing it to be false,
whereby B obtains credit; but notwithstanding this representation,
the seller takes from A his written stipulation to guaranty the payment.
In this case, I perceive no objection to a creditor’s election of
the remedy. The fraudulent representation of solvency would sustain
the action for deceit. The written guaranty would support an action
on the contract. It seems, therefore, immaterial here, whether the
plaintiffs have or have not a demand which may be enforced in a different
form. The question is, will the facts stated sustain an action for
deceit?</p>

<p class='c007'>After attentive consideration, I am inclined to think the plaintiffs
are not entitled to recover. However reprehensible the conduct of the
defendant may appear in a moral point of view, we cannot deny to him
the protection of the common law; which does not reach cases of imperfect
obligation. If this be an attempt on the part of the plaintiffs
to get rid of the statute of frauds, I can only say, the occasion justified
the experiment, and calls for a patient and critical examination.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>If this case is stripped of the general allegations in the declaration,
of fraud and deceit, it appears to me that the gravamen is nothing
more than that the defendant encouraged the plaintiffs to sell to
Castro and Henriques; and, as surety, promised to endorse their
notes. The intention of the party not to fulfil, has not, I believe, ever
been considered among the fraudulent acts, which, in judgment of law,
render a party liable. The maker of a promissory note may not, at the
time, intend to make payment. On this note, the plaintiff may declare
that the defendant intended to deceive and defraud; but it is
mere matter of form, sanctioned by precedent in pleading. The maker
may go farther, and on the strength of assurances to pay punctually,
never intended to be performed, induce the lender to part with his
money, and accept the borrower’s note. All this is immoral. Still the
remedy is on the contract. The law has not recognized it as the substantive
ground of fraud. That no cases are to be met with in the
books going the length contended for, is good evidence that the doctrine
is novel, and has never been acted upon.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>It is evident what must be the species of fraud, for which the law
gives redress; falsehood as to an existing fact. If, as Buller, J., observes,
every deceit includes a lie, it follows, that the representation,
and promise of the defendant are not comprised within the legal acceptation
of that term. The test of a lie is, that the fact asserted is
not true at the time; which cannot be predicated of the facts in this
case; for, although the defendant promised with the intent not to perform,
it was not then false, nor could it be. It referred to an act to be
done <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in futuro</span></i>. Until the defendant had refused to endorse, it could
not be said he had violated his promise.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Trespass on the Case for deceit. Certified from the Common
Pleas Division on demurrer to the declaration.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tillinghast, J.</span> This is trespass on the case for deceit. The first
count in the declaration alleges that the defendant, intending to deceive
and defraud the plaintiffs, did buy of them on credit certain
goods and chattels of the value of $400, the said defendant not then
and there intending to pay for the same, but intending wickedly and
fraudulently to cheat the plaintiffs out of the value of said goods and
chattels, which said sum of $400 the defendant refuses to pay, to the
plaintiffs’ damage, &amp;c. The second count, after setting out the fraudulent
conduct aforesaid, alleges that the defendant thereby then and
there represented that he intended to pay for said goods, but that he
did not then and there intend to pay for the same, but wickedly and
fraudulently intended to cheat the plaintiffs out of the value of said
goods and chattels, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this declaration the defendant has demurred, and for grounds of
demurrer to the first count thereof, he says, (1) that the plaintiffs do
not allege any false representation by the defendant; (2) that the
plaintiffs do not allege that they have acted upon any false representation
of the defendant; and (3) that the plaintiffs do not allege any
damage suffered by them in acting upon any false representation of
the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>The grounds of demurrer to the second count are, (1) that the plaintiffs
do not allege any false representation by the defendant as to any
fact present or past, but only as to something that would happen in
the future, which, if in the future it proved not to be true, would not
be the subject matter of a false representation, but simply a promise
broken, and therefore not a ground of an action of deceit; (2) that
the plaintiffs do not allege that they acted upon any false representation
made by the defendant; and (3) that the plaintiffs do not allege
that they suffered any damage by acting upon any false representation
made by the defendant to the plaintiffs.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are inclined to the opinion, after some hesitation, that the declaration
states a case of deceit. Any fraudulent misrepresentation
or device whereby one person deceives another, who has no means of
detecting the fraud, to his injury and damage, is a sufficient ground
for an action of deceit. Deceit is a species of fraud, and consists of
any false representation or contrivance whereby one person overreaches
and misleads another, to his hurt. And, while the fraudulent
misrepresentation relied upon usually consists of statements made as
to material facts, either verbally or in writing, yet it may be made by
conduct as well. Grinnell on Law of Deceit, p. 35. A man may not
only deceive another, to his hurt, by deliberately asserting a falsehood,
as, for instance, by stating that A. is an honest man when he
knows him to be a rogue, or that a horse is sound and kind when he
knows him to be unsound and vicious, but also by any act or demeanor
which would naturally impress the mind of a careful man
with a mistaken belief, and form the basis of some change of position
by him. 1 Story, Eq. Jur. § 192. In Ex parte Whittaker, In re
Shackleton, L. R. 10 Ch. 449, Mellish, L. J., says: “It is true, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>that a party must not make any misrepresentation, express or
<em>implied</em>, and as at present advised I think Shackleton when he went
for the goods must be taken to have made an implied representation
that he intended to pay for them, and if it were clearly made out that
at that time he did not intend to pay for them, I should consider that
a case of fraudulent misrepresentation was shown.” See also Lobdell
<em>v.</em> Baker, 1 Met. 201; 1 Benjamin on Sales, ed. of 1888, § 524.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case at bar, the declaration alleges that the defendant bought
the goods in question upon credit, fraudulently intending not to pay
for them but to cheat the plaintiffs out of the value thereof. By the
act of buying the goods of the plaintiffs the defendant impliedly
promised to pay for the same, which promise was equally as strong
and binding as though it had been made in words, or even in writing.
The plaintiffs had the right to rely on this promise, and to presume
that it was made in good faith. It turns out, however, according to
the allegations aforesaid, that it was not made in good faith, but, on the
contrary, was made for the purpose of deceiving the plaintiffs into
the act of parting with their goods, the defendant intending by the
transaction to cheat them out of the value thereof. The fraud, then,
consisted in the making of the promise, in the manner aforesaid, with
intent not to perform it. By the act of purchasing the goods on credit,
the defendant impliedly represented that he intended to pay for them.
The plaintiffs relied on this representation, which was material and
fraudulent, and were damaged thereby. All the necessary elements
of fraud or deceit therefore were present in the transaction. See Upton
<em>v.</em> Vail, 6 Johns. 181; Bartholomew <em>v.</em> Bentley, 15 Ohio, 666; Bishop,
Non-Contract Law, §§ 314–318; Burrill <em>v.</em> Stevens, 73 Me. 400; Barney
<em>v.</em> Dewey, 13 Johns. 226; Hubbel <em>v.</em> Meigs, 50 N. Y. 491. The
general doctrine which controls this action is fully reviewed by Mr.
Wallace in a note to Pasley <em>v.</em> Freeman, 2 Smith’s Lead. Cas. 101. As
said by Bigelow on Fraud, page 484, “to profess an intent to do or not
to do when a party intends the contrary, is as clear a case of misrepresentation
and of fraud as could be made.” See also p. 466 as to what
constitutes a representation. In Goodwin <em>v.</em> Horne, 60 N. H. 486, the
court say: “Ordinarily false promises are not fraudulent, nor evidence
of fraud, and only false representations of past or existing facts
are actionable or can be made the ground of defence.... But when
a promise is made with no intention of performance, and for the very
purpose of accomplishing a fraud, it is a most apt and effectual means
to that end, and the victim has a remedy by action or defence. Such
are cases of concealed insolvency and purchases of goods with no intention
to pay for them.” In Byrd <em>v.</em> Hall, 1 Abb. A. D. 286, it was
held that, although a purchase of goods on credit by one who knows
himself to be insolvent is not fraudulent, yet where it is made with a
preconceived design not to pay, it is fraudulent. See also Milliken <em>v.</em>
Miller, 12 R. I. 296; Thompson <em>v.</em> Rose, 16 Conn. 81; Hennequin <em>v.</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>Naylor, 24 N. Y. 129; Devoe <em>v.</em> Brandt, 53 N. Y. 465; Story on Sales,
2d ed. § 176, and cases in note 2; Douthitt <em>v.</em> Applegate, 33 Kans. 395;
Morrill <em>v.</em> Blackman, 42 Conn. 324; Skinner <em>v.</em> Flint, 105 Mass. 528;
Earl of Bristol <em>v.</em> Wilsmore, 2 Dow. &amp; Ry. 760; Lobdell <em>v.</em> Baker, 1
Met. 193; Cooley on Torts, 2d ed. 559; Load <em>v.</em> Green, 15 M. &amp; W.
215. In short, the making of one state of things to appear, to those
with whom you deal, to be the true state of things, while you are acting
on the knowledge of a different state of things—among the oldest
definitions of fraud in contracts—is exemplified in this case. See
Lee <em>v.</em> Jones, 17 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 494. The defendant made it to appear,
by the act of buying on credit, that he intended to pay for the goods
in question, while in fact he intended to cheat the plaintiffs out of
them. And to hold that such a transaction does not amount to fraud,
would be to make it easy for cheats and swindlers to escape the just
consequence of their unrighteous acts.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have hesitated somewhat in arriving at the conclusion that an
action of deceit will lie, upon the facts set out in the declaration, for
the reason that, amongst the numerous cases of fraud and deceit to
be found in the books, we have not been referred to any, nor have we
been able to find any, where the action of deceit was based simply on
the act of buying goods on credit, intending not to pay for them. In
Lyons <em>v.</em> Briggs, 14 R. I. 224, which was an action of deceit, Durfee,
C. J., intimates, however, that deceit would lie in a case like the one
before us, by the use of the following language: “It is not alleged
that the buyer did not intend to pay when he bought, but only that
he falsely and fraudulently asserted that he could be safely trusted.”
But the authorities are overwhelming to the effect that it is fraud to
purchase goods intending not to pay for them, and that the vendor,
upon discovering the fraud, may repudiate the sale and reclaim the
property, or may sue in trover, or in some other action of tort, for the
damages sustained by the fraud. And this being so, we fail to see
why an action of deceit, which is an action of tort, based on fraud,
may not lie as well. For to obtain goods on credit, intending not to
pay for them, is as much a trick or device as it would be falsely to
represent in words any material fact whereby the vendor should be
induced to part therewith.</p>

<p class='c007'>But defendant’s counsel contends that the alleged representation
was not as to any fact present or past, but merely as to what the
defendant would do in the future with reference to paying for the
goods, and that to say what one intends to do is identical to saying
what one will do in the future, which amounts simply to a promise;
and, furthermore, that a representation of what will happen in the
future, even if not realized, is not such a representation as will support
this action. We do not assent to this method of reasoning. The
state of a man’s mind at a given time is as much a fact as is the state
of his digestion. Intention is a fact; Clift <em>v.</em> White, 12 N. Y. 538;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>hence a witness may be asked with what intent he did a given act.
Seymour <em>v.</em> Wilson, 14 N. Y. 567. A man who buys and obtains possession
of goods on credit, intending not to pay for them, is then and
there guilty of fraud. The wrong is fully completed and no longer
exists in intention merely, and a cause of action instantly accrues
thereon in favor of the vendor to recover for the wrong and injury
sustained. It is true the purchaser may afterwards repent of the
wrong and pay for the goods, and the vendor may never know of the
wrongful intent. But this does not alter the case at all as to the original
wrong and the liability incurred thereby. Of course a mere intention
to commit a crime or to do a wrong is no offence. But when
the intention is coupled with the doing or accomplishment of the act
intended, that moment the wrong is perpetrated and the corresponding
liability incurred. See Oswego Starch Factory <em>v.</em> Lendrum, 57
Iowa, 573.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Stewart <em>v.</em> Emerson, 52 N. H. 301, where it was alleged, in reply
to the defendant’s plea of discharge in bankruptcy, that the debt in
question was created by the fraud of the defendant, Doe, J., in the
course of a long and vigorous opinion, used the following language,
which is so apt and pertinent that we quote it. He said: “When the
intent not to pay is concealed, the intent to defraud is acted out. The
mere omission of A. to disclose his insolvency might not be satisfactory
proof of a fraudulent intent in all cases. He might expect to
become solvent. He might intend to pay all his creditors. He might
intend to pay B. though unable to pay others. His fixed purpose
<em>never</em> to pay B. is a very different thing from his present inability to
pay all or any of his creditors. A man may buy goods, with time for
trying to pay for them, on the strength of his known or inferred disposition
to pay his debts, his habits, character, business capacity, and
financial prospects, without his present solvency being thought of,
and even when his present insolvency is known to the vendor. But
who could obtain goods on credit, with an unconcealed determination
that they should never be paid for? The concealment of such a determination
is conduct which reasonably involves a false representation
of an existing fact, is not less material than a misrepresentation of
ability to pay (Bradley <em>v.</em> Obear, 10 N. H. 477), and is an actual
artifice, intended and fitted to deceive.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An application for or acceptance of credit, by a purchaser, is a
representation of the existence of an intent to pay at a future time,
and a representation of the non-existence of an intent not to pay.
What principle of law requires a false and fraudulent representation
to be express, or forbids it to be fairly inferred from the act of purchase?
A representation of a material fact, implied from the act of
purchase, and inducing the owner of goods to sell them, is as effective
for the vendee’s purpose as if it had been previously and expressly
made. If it is false, and known to the pretended purchaser to be false,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>and is intended and used by him as a means of converting another’s
goods to his own use without compensation, under the false pretence
of a purchase, why does it not render such a purchase fraudulent?
When the intent is to pay, it is necessarily understood by both parties,
and need not be expressly represented as existing. When the intent
is not to pay, it is of course concealed. Whether the deceit is called a
false and fraudulent representation of the existence of an intent to pay,
or a fraudulent concealment of the existence of an intent not to pay,
the fraud described is, in fact, one and the same fraud.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>The instructions to the jury upon that point present the question, whether
getting property by a purchase upon credit, with an intention of the purchaser
never to pay for the same, constitutes such a fraud as will entitle the seller
to avoid the sale, although there are no fraudulent misrepresentations or
false pretences.</p>

<p class='c019'>The question has never been fairly before this Court before this time, so as
to require a deliberate decision. The plaintiff contends that the question was
settled in the negative in the case of Long <em>v.</em> Woodman, 58 Maine, 49. But
that case falls short of meeting the question presented in the present case.
The gist of the charge against the purchaser in that case seems to have been
that he fraudulently refused to do after the contract what he agreed to do at
the time of the contract, the alleged fraud being an intention formed after the
contract rather than contemporaneously with it; and that was an action of
deceit based upon a broken promise to convey real estate. Of late years, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi
prius</span></i> rulings in our own Courts have frequently been in accordance with the
law as delivered to the jury by the presiding judge in the case at bar, and we
think the doctrine may safely be accepted and approved, both upon authority
and principle.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is the admitted doctrine of the English cases, and is sustained by most
of the courts in the United States. In Benj. on Sales (2d Amer. ed.), § 440,
note e, very numerous cases are cited to the proposition. Stewart <em>v.</em> Emerson,
52 N. H. 301, discusses the question at length, and reviews many authorities.</p>

<p class='c019'>The plaintiff relies upon the objection that it is not an indictable fraud,
an argument which seems to have inclined the Pennsylvania Court against
admitting the principle into the jurisprudence of that State. Smith <em>v.</em> Smith,
21 Pa. St. 367; Backentoss <em>v.</em> Speicher, 31 Pa. St. 324. It has been held by
some Courts to be an indictable cheat, the false pretence being in the vendee’s
pretendingly making a purchase, while his only purpose is to cheat the vendor
out of his goods. It is more often considered, however, as not a matter for
indictment. Bish. Crim. Law, § 419. But the objection taken by the plaintiff
has generally been considered as insufficient to override the rule.</p>

<p class='c019'>But the doctrine governing the case before us should not be misunderstood.
To constitute the fraud, there must be a preconceived design never to pay for
the goods. A mere intent not to pay for the goods when the debt becomes due,
is not enough; that falls short of the idea. A design not to pay according to
the contract is not equivalent to an intention never to pay for the goods, and
does not amount to an intention to defraud the seller outright, although it
may be evidence of such a contemplated fraud.</p>

<p class='c019'>Nor is it enough to constitute the fraud that the buyer is insolvent, and
knows himself to be so, at the time of the purchase, and conceals the fact
from the seller, and has not reasonable expectations that he can ever pay the
debt.<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c015'><sup>[324]</sup></a> Some Courts have gone so far as to denominate that a fraud which will
avoid the sale. And it may have been so held in bankruptcy Courts, in some
instances, as between a vendor and the assignee of the vendee. But it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>not, generally, be enough to prove the fraud. The inquiry is not whether the
vendee had reasonable grounds to believe he could pay the debt at some time
and in some way, but whether he intended in point of fact not to pay it.</p>

<p class='c019'>Nor is it enough that after the purchase the vendee conceives a design and
forms a purpose not to pay for the goods, and successfully avoids paying for
them. The only intent that renders the sale fraudulent is a positive and predetermined
intention, entertained and acted upon at the time of going through
the forms of an apparent sale, never to pay for the goods. Cross <em>v.</em> Peters, 1
Greenl. 378; Biggs <em>v.</em> Barry, 2 Curtis, (C. C. R.) 259; Parker <em>v.</em> Byrnes, 1
Low. 539; Rowley <em>v.</em> Bigelow, 12 Pick. 306.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Riddick, J., in</span> BUGG <em>v.</em> WERTHEIMER-SCHWARTZ SHOE COMPANY<br /> (1897) <cite>64 Arkansas, 12, 17, 18.</cite></h4>

<p class='c022'>Nor can we sustain the contention of appellant that to entitle the vendor
to avoid a sale after delivery it must in all cases be shown that the vendee
did not intend to pay for the goods. That is, as above stated, one ground on
which the sale may be avoided, but not the only one. If the vendee knowingly
makes false representations concerning material facts, and thus induces
the seller to part with his goods, the seller may elect to avoid the sale, and this
without regard to whether the buyer intended to pay for the goods or not.
The fraud in such a case consists in inducing the vendor to part with his goods
by false statements of the buyer, known to be false when made, or made by
him when he has no reasonable ground to believe that they are true. If a
vendor parts with his goods on the faith of such false statements made by the
buyer, it would be strange if the law permitted the buyer to reap the fruits of
such conduct, and retain the goods against the will of the vendor. To illustrate,
let us suppose a case. A man with no property, but with great faith in
his ability as a merchant, goes to a city and calls on a wholesale merchant for
the purpose of buying a stock of goods. He believes that if he can obtain a
stock of goods, his experience and ability will soon enable him to pay off the
purchase price, but, fearing that the merchant may refuse to sell if he learns
that he has no property, he thereupon, for the purpose of obtaining the goods,
states to the merchant that he has money in the bank, and owns a large
amount of both real and personal property. The merchant, ignorant of the
facts, and relying on the truth of these statements, parts with his goods. He
afterwards discovers the fraud, and brings an action to recover the goods.
In such a case would it be a valid defence for the buyer to say that, although
he had secured the goods by misrepresentation, yet he did honestly intend to
pay for them? Clearly it would not. The courts would answer such a question
substantially as it was answered by the Supreme Court of Connecticut
when it said that the intent of the buyer to pay “may have lessened the
moral turpitude of his act, but it will not suffice to antidote and neutralize
an intentionally false statement which had accomplished its object of benefiting
himself and of misleading the plaintiffs to their injury.” Judd <em>v.</em> Weber,

</div>

<p class='c014'>The third count in the declaration is tort for deceit in the sale of
certain stock by the defendant to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>The allegations, so far as material here, are in substance as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Plaintiff says that the defendant, by its agent, with intent to deceive
and defraud the plaintiff, falsely and fraudulently represented
to him [here specifying certain representations], and that, if the plaintiff
would purchase a certain number of shares of stock in the defendant
corporation and pay therefor the sum of $9000,&#160;... the $9000
paid by the plaintiff should be put in the treasury of said corporation
to be used as a working capital. And plaintiff says that, relying upon
the representations, he bought the shares and paid therefor $9000;
and plaintiff says that said representations were false and untrue to
the knowledge of the defendant in this: [specifying certain particulars],
and the $9000 paid by plaintiff was not put in its treasury and
used as working capital, but was, with the approval of the defendant,
its directors and manager, used for other purposes than the business
of the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Verdict for plaintiff for $1.00 damages. Plaintiff alleged exceptions
as to the ruling at the trial in reference to this count.<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c015'><sup>[325]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Hammond, J.</span>... The exceptions relate only to the third count,
and since the verdict was for the plaintiff on this, they are material
only so far as they respect the question of damages. The principal
difference between the instructions given by the judge and those
requested by the plaintiff is that the judge declined to permit the jury
to consider the allegation with reference to the promised use of the
$9000 paid by the plaintiff for the stock. As to this it is contended
by the plaintiff that at the time the defendant promised to use the
money as working capital it did not intend to keep the promise, and
that a representation of a present intention is a representation of an
existing fact and therefore may be false and fraudulent. But, without
implying that the plaintiff’s contention would be true under any
circumstances, the difficulty with his case is that the question is not
raised upon the record. The ruling that the jury should not consider
the allegation with reference to the promised use of the money appears
to have been made with reference to the third count, and, as
applied to that, it was correct. An examination of the count will
show that it does not contain any allegation that at the time the defendant
said that the money should be used for working capital it
had not the intention to perform that promise. It first sets out the
representations which induced the plaintiff to purchase the stock,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>then proceeds to state in what respects they were false and fraudulent
and the defendant’s knowledge of the falsity, and then follows the
only allegation respecting the representation as to the promised use
of the money: “And the nine thousand dollars paid by the plaintiff
to the defendant was not put in its treasury and used as working
capital, but was, with the approval of the defendant, its directors and
manager, used for other purposes than the business of the defendant.”
This is an allegation that the defendant failed to carry out its promise,
and falls far short of an allegation that the defendant at the time it was
made did not intend to carry it out. There is no allegation whatever
as to the intent of the defendant at the time the promise was made.
Indeed it is difficult to read that count, either by itself or in connection
with the other counts, without feeling that the pleader studiously
avoided alleging anything as to that intent. While the evidence as
to the promised use and the actual use of this money may have been
admissible upon the second count, the object of which was to recover
damages for breach of the promise, it was not material upon the third
count, even upon the question of damages, for the reasons above
stated.</p>

which is shown to have been false is that relating to the cost of the
land. Would that statement have authorized the jury to find for the
defendant? It was said in Hemmer <em>v.</em> Cooper, 8 Allen, 334, that
“the representations of a vendor of real estate, to the vendee, as to
the price he paid for it, are to be regarded in the same light as representations
respecting its value. A purchaser ought not to rely upon
them; for it is settled that even when they are false, and uttered with
a view to deceive, they furnish no ground of action.” That rule was
followed in Cooper <em>v.</em> Lovering, 106 Mass. 77, and it is the rule of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>Tuck <em>v.</em> Downing, 76 Ill. 71, and Banta <em>v.</em> Palmer, 47 Ill. 99. In Holbrook
<em>v.</em> Connor, 60 Me. 578, it was said: “The statement of the
vendor that he paid a certain price for the land, if true, can be no more
than an indication of his opinion of its value; and when we consider
the various motives which may, and often do, actuate men in making
their purchases, and especially when it is done for speculation, it is
but the slightest proof of such opinion.” As a general rule, a vendee
has no right to rely upon the statements of the vendor respecting the
value of the property sold, but must act upon his own judgment, or
seek information for himself. But to that rule there are exceptions. It
was said in Simar <em>v.</em> Canaday, 53 N. Y. 306, that where statements
as to the value are mere matter of opinion and belief, no liability is
created by uttering them, but that such statements “may be, under
certain circumstances, affirmations of fact. When known to the utterer
to be untrue, if made with the intention of misleading the vendee,
if he does rely upon them, and is misled to his injury, they void<a id='t552'></a>
the contract.” The fraud which vitiates a contract must be material,
affecting the very essence of the contract; but ordinarily, “if the
fraud be such that, had it not been practiced, the contract would not
have been made, then it is material to it.” 2 Parsons, Contract, 770.
See, also, 2 Pomeroy Equity Jurisprudence, section 878, and notes.
That rule was applied in Smith <em>v.</em> Countryman, 30 N. Y. 656, which
was an action upon a contract for the sale of hops. It was held that
a false representation made by the vendee as to the price at which he
had purchased hops of another person, which was relied upon by the
vendor, and induced him to enter into the contract of sale, was material,
and constituted a defence to an action on the contract. This rule
appears to us to be in harmony with reason and the principles of justice.
The price at which property actually sells in the open market
is very satisfactory evidence of its value at the time of the sale. We
cannot assent to the proposition that the statement of a vendor that
he paid a specified price for the property he sells is a mere expression
of opinion, upon which the purchaser has no right to rely. On the
contrary, we think it is a statement of fact; and if the purchaser,
without knowing or having reason to know what price was paid, relies
upon the false statement, to his injury, he is entitled to relief. The
cases of Teachout <em>v.</em> Van Hoesen, 76 Iowa, 113; Iler <em>v.</em> Griswold, 83
Iowa, 442, and Coles <em>v.</em> Kennedy, 81 Iowa, 360, although not precisely
in point, tend to sustain our conclusion. See French <em>v.</em> Ryan,
104 Mich. 625 (62 N. W. Rep. 1016); Moon <em>v.</em> McKinstry, 107 Mich.

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Holmes, J.</span> This is an action for fraudulent representations alleged
to have been made to one Dr. Jordan, the plaintiff’s agent, for the purpose
of inducing the plaintiff to purchase a railroad bond from the
defendant....<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c015'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Among the representations relied on, one was that the railroad mortgaged,
which was situated in Ohio, was good security for the bonds;
and another was that the bond was of the very best and safest, and was
an A No. 1 bond. With regard to these and the like, the defendant
asked the Court to instruct the jury “that no representations which
the defendant might have made or did make to Dr. Jordan in relation
to the value of the bond in question, or of the railroad, its terminals,
and other property which were mortgaged to secure it, with other
bonds, even though false, were representations upon which Dr. Jordan
ought to have relied, and are not sufficient to furnish any grounds for
this action;” and also, “that each of the expressions ‘and that the
same’ (meaning said railroad and all the property covered by the
mortgage) ‘was good security for said bonds,’ ‘that said bond was of
the very best and safest, and was an A No. 1 bond,’ are expressions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>opinion of value, and even though false, are not such representations
as Dr. Jordan had a right to rely upon, and are not enough to furnish
any grounds for this action.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court declined to give these instructions, and instead instructed
the jury that “an expression of opinion, judgment, or estimate, or a
statement of a promissory nature relating to what would be in the
future, so far as they were expressions of opinion, if made in good
faith, however strong as expressions of belief, would not support an
action of deceit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be seen that the fundamental difference between the instructions
given and those asked is that the former require good faith. The
language of some cases certainly seems to suggest that bad faith might
make a seller liable for what are known as seller’s statements, apart
from any other conduct by which the buyer is fraudulently induced to
forbear inquiries. Pike <em>v.</em> Fay, 101 Mass. 134. But this is a mistake.
It is settled that the law does not exact good faith from a seller
in those vague commendations of his wares which manifestly are open
to difference of opinion, which do not imply untrue assertions concerning
matters of direct observation (Teague <em>v.</em> Irwin, 127 Mass. 217),
and as to which it always has been “understood, the world over, that
such statements are to be distrusted.” Brown <em>v.</em> Castles, 11 Cush.
348, 350; Gordon <em>v.</em> Parmelee, 2 Allen, 212; Parker <em>v.</em> Moulton,
114 Mass. 99; Poland <em>v.</em> Brownell, 131 Mass. 138, 142; Burns <em>v.</em>
Lane, 138 Mass. 350, 356. Parker <em>v.</em> Moulton also shows that the
rule is not changed by the mere fact that the property is at a distance,
and is not seen by the buyer. Moreover, in this case, market prices at
least were easily accessible to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant was known by the plaintiff’s agent to stand in the
position of a seller. If he went no further than to say that the bond
was an A No. 1 bond, which we understand to mean simply that it was
a first rate bond, or that the railroad was good security for the bonds,
we are constrained to hold that he is not liable under the circumstances
of this case, even if he made the statement in bad faith. See, further,
Veasey <em>v.</em> Doton, 3 Allen, 380; Belcher <em>v.</em> Costello, 122 Mass. 189.
The rule of law is hardly to be regretted, when it is considered how
easily and insensibly words of hope or expectation are converted by
an interested memory into statements of quality and value when the
expectation has been disappointed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Tort for deceit. The declaration alleged that the plaintiff sold and
conveyed to the defendant certain real estate situate in Medford “for
the sum of nineteen hundred dollars, and received in payment thereof
fourteen hundred dollars in cash and four certain promissory notes all
signed by one H. Joseph, amounting together to the sum of six hundred
and fourteen hundredths dollars; that the defendant, to induce
the plaintiff to convey said real estate to him, falsely represented to
the plaintiff that the maker of said notes was a man of property, and
that said notes were as ‘good as gold’; that your plaintiff, believing
said representations to be true, was thereby induced to convey said
real estate to the defendant; that said representations were false and
were known to the defendant to be false, and by reason thereof the
plaintiff suffered great damage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before Hammond, J.,
who found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions, the
nature of which appears in the opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Knowlton, J.</span> The principal question in this case is whether there
was any evidence to warrant a finding that the false representations
made by the defendant in regard to the notes were actionable. This
finding is in these words: “I find that the defendant represented
these notes to be as good as gold, and that that representation was intended
by him and understood by the plaintiff, not to be an expression
of opinion, but a statement of a fact of his own knowledge. I find
that the notes were worthless.” It is contended by the defendant that
such a representation is necessarily, and as a matter of law, a mere expression
of opinion, for which, however wilfully false, and however
damaging in the reliance placed upon it, no action can be maintained.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that such a representation may be, and often is, a mere
expression of opinion. But we think that it may be made under such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>circumstances and in such a way as properly to be understood as a
statement of fact upon which one may well rely.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Stubbs <em>v.</em> Johnson, 127 Mass. 219, one of the representations in
regard to a note was that it was “as good as gold,” and the jury were
instructed that, if this was intended as a representation of the financial
ability of the maker of the note, it was a statement of a material fact,
for which the defendant was liable. This instruction was held erroneous
“because a representation as to a man’s financial ability to pay
a debt may be made either as a matter of opinion, or as a matter of
fact; the subject of the statement does not necessarily determine
which it is.... It is often impossible,” says Mr. Justice Colt further
in the opinion, “to determine, as matter of law, whether a statement
is a representation of a fact, which the defendant intended should be
understood as true of his own knowledge, or an expression of opinion.
That will depend upon the nature of the representation, the meaning
of the language used, as applied to the subject matter, and as interpreted
by the surrounding circumstances, in each case. The question
is generally to be submitted to the jury.” The opinion plainly implies
that, if the jury had been left to determine whether there was a representation
of the maker’s financial ability to pay made as matter of
fact and not as mere matter of opinion, they might have found against
the defendant on his false representation that the note was “as good
as gold.” In Belcher <em>v.</em> Costello, 122 Mass. 189, there is also a strong
intimation that the rule is as above stated. In Safford <em>v.</em> Grout, 120
Mass. 20, the representation set out in the declaration was that the
maker of the note “was a person of ample means and ability to pay
said note, and that the note was good.” The plaintiff was allowed to
recover. The court says of the representations, “We must presume
that they were legally sufficient to support the action; that is to say,
that they were statements of facts susceptible of knowledge, as distinguished
from matters of mere opinion or belief.” See also Morse
<em>v.</em> Shaw, 124 Mass. 59; Teague <em>v.</em> Irwin, 127 Mass. 217.</p>

<p class='c007'>In two recent cases, Way <em>v.</em> Ryther, 165 Mass. 226, and Kilgore <em>v.</em>
Bruce, 166 Mass. 136, 138, this court has expressed a disinclination to
extend the rule which permits dealers to indulge with impunity in
false representations of opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case now before us the notes were turned over to the plaintiff
in part payment of the agreed price for land sold to the defendant.
He professed to know, and probably did know, all about the financial
standing of the maker of them, who lived in Boston. The plaintiff
lived in a suburban town and knew nothing of the maker. She was
obliged to take the defendant’s representations or to decline to deal
with him until she could go to Boston and make an investigation for
herself.<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c015'><sup>[331]</sup></a> He told her that he had lent money to the maker, and said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>“Do you suppose I would lend my money to any one that was not
good?”</p>

<p class='c007'>A representation that a note is as good as gold may be founded on
absolute personal knowledge of the validity of the note, and upon an
equally certain knowledge of the maker’s financial ability. The known
facts upon which financial ability depends may be so clear and cogent
as to make the consequent conclusion, which ordinarily would be a
mere matter of opinion, a matter of moral certainty which can properly
be called knowledge. We cannot say, as matter of law, that this
representation was not intended to be, and properly understood to be,
a representation of facts within the defendant’s knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case of Deming <em>v.</em> Darling, 148 Mass. 504, differs materially
from this at bar. The property to which the representation related
was one of many mortgage bonds issued by a railroad company, of
which, in the language of the opinion, the “market prices at least were
easily accessible to the plaintiff.” The representations which were
held to be insufficient on which to found an action were “in relation
to the value of the bond in question, or of the railroad, its terminals,
and other property which were mortgaged to secure it.” The value of
articles sold in market, and especially of railroad property and of railroad
bonds payable in the distant future, is ordinarily only a matter
of opinion. A statement of the value of such property is very different
from a statement that a promissory note which is almost due is
known to be valid, and that the maker of it is a person of such known
integrity and financial ability that his promise to pay is as good as that
of the state or nation. A statement that a note is as good as gold may
be intended to represent facts of this kind.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>Error to the Circuit Court of Montgomery County.</p>

<p class='c019'>The plaintiff in error was indicted for obtaining money and property by
certain false pretences, to wit: that certain real estate situate in Benton
township, Pike County, being one hundred and ten acres in quantity, was
then and there of the value of $11,000, and that one Martha M. Williams,
then and there believing said representation of value to be true, and relying
and acting upon that belief, was induced to and did purchase from the plaintiff
in error, the said real estate, and accepted his deed therefor, and gave to
him and one Neal Overholser in payment therefor, money and property to the
amount and value of $7700, whereas, in fact, the said real estate was not then
and there of the value of $11,000, and was of the value not to exceed three
dollars per acre, that is, $330 in all; and that the plaintiff in error then and
there knew that the value of said real estate did not exceed the sum of $330,
and knew at the time he so falsely represented the value of said real estate
that the same was false. To this indictment the plaintiff in error filed a
motion to quash and also a demurrer, which were both overruled; and the
case coming on for trial, at the close of the evidence introduced by the state,
a motion was made by the defendant to instruct the jury to return a verdict
of acquittal, which was overruled; and the court thereupon charged the
jury, among other things, as follows: “But where the buyer relies entirely
upon the representations of the seller and the seller knows that the property
he is describing is of such small value as to be practically worthless, and
nevertheless represents it to be worth a specified sum of great amount, and
the discrepancy between the real and the represented value is so enormous
as to shock the conscience; when the representation is so grossly untrue that
it could not be made upon any possible foundation of belief; and when it
appears that the seller was plainly seeking by means of such statement to
obtain the property of the buyer and practically return no equivalent therefor,
the court takes the responsibility of saying to you that you have the
right, if your judgment of evidence so convinces you, to regard such representations
as one of fact rather than mere opinion.” The jury found the defendant
guilty and judgment was rendered accordingly, which judgment was
affirmed by the Circuit Court, and this proceeding in error is to reverse that
judgment.<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c015'><sup>[333]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Davis, J.</span> A statement of value may be given either as an opinion or as a
statement of fact. All the authorities agree that if a statement of value is
given as an opinion merely it cannot be regarded as a foundation for an indictment.
But if the statement is made as an existing fact, when the accused
knows it to be false and intends it to be an inducement to the other party, and
it is so understood and relied upon by the other party, then it becomes a false
representation of a material fact for which the party making the representation
is indictable. Whether the representation of value is intended as an expression
of opinion, or whether it was made as a statement of an existing fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>which the speaker intends to be an inducement to the other party, is therefore
a material question of fact to be determined by the jury.</p>

<p class='c019'>There is no novelty in this view of the law. In Reg. <em>v.</em> Evans, 8 Cox, C. C.
257, it was said by Pollock, C. B.: “As my brother, Crowder, J., has suggested,
if the prisoner had represented the note to be of the value of £5 when
she knew it was not of that value, she might have been guilty of false pretences.”
In People <em>v.</em> Peckens, 153 N. Y. 576, 591, the court say: “It is
insisted that many of the representations to the complainant and her husband,
which induced the making and delivery of her deed, were expressions of
opinion, and although false and known to be so, no liability resulted. As a
general rule, the mere expression of an opinion, which is understood to be only
an opinion, does not render a person expressing it liable for fraud. But where
the statements are as to value or quality, and are made by a person knowing
them to be untrue, with an intent to deceive and mislead the one to whom they
are made, and he is thus induced to forbear making inquiries which he otherwise
would, that may amount to an affirmation of fact rendering him liable
therefor. In such a case, whether a representation is an expression of an
opinion or an affirmation of a fact is a question for the jury. The rule that no
one is liable for an expression of an opinion is applicable only when the opinion
stands by itself as a distinct thing. If it is given in bad faith, with knowledge
of its untruthfulness, to defraud others, the person making it is liable, especially
when it is as to a fact affecting quality or value and is peculiarly within
the knowledge of the person making it. Watson <em>v.</em> People, 87 N. Y. 561;
Simar <em>v.</em> Canaday, 53 N. Y. 298; Hickey <em>v.</em> Morrell, 102 N. Y. 454, 463;
Schumacher <em>v.</em> Mather, 133 N. Y. 590, 595.” The same view of the question
is presented in Holton <em>v.</em> State, 109 Ga. 127, 130; and also in People <em>v.</em> Jordan,
66 Cal. 10, 13, 14.</p>

<p class='c019'>Simar <em>v.</em> Canaday, 53 N. Y. 298, was a civil action for damages for an
alleged fraud in inducing the plaintiffs to convey certain premises. The court,
at page 306, said: “The defendant contends that the representations alleged
to have been made by the defendant were not such as to afford a ground for an
action. It is first insisted that the statements as to the value of the lands and
of the mortgages thereon were mere matter of opinion and belief, and that no
action could be maintained upon them if false. If they were such, no liability
is created by the utterance of them; but all statements as to the value of
property sold are not such. They may be, under certain circumstances,
affirmation of fact. When known to the utterer to be untrue, if made with the
intention of misleading the vendee, if he does rely upon them and is misled to

And where they are fraudulently made of particulars in relation to the estate
which the vendee has not equal means of knowing, and where he is induced to
forbear inquiries which he would otherwise have made, and damage ensues,
the party guilty of the fraud should be liable for the damage sustained. Medbury

</div>

<p class='c014'>In considering whether there was a misrepresentation, I will first
deal with the argument that the particulars only contain a statement
of opinion about the tenant. It is material to observe that it is often
fallaciously assumed that a statement of opinion cannot involve the
statement of a fact. In a case where the facts are equally well known
to both parties, what one of them says to the other is frequently nothing
but an expression of opinion. The statement of such opinion is in
a sense a statement of a fact, about the condition of the man’s own
mind, but only of an irrelevant fact, for it is of no consequence what
the opinion is. But if the facts are not equally known to both sides,
then a statement of opinion by the one who knows the facts best involves
very often a statement of a material fact, for he impliedly states
that he knows facts which justify his opinion. Now a landlord knows
the relations between himself and his tenant; other persons either do
not know them at all or do not know them equally well, and if the
landlord says that he considers that the relations between himself and
his tenant are satisfactory, he really avers that the facts peculiarly
within his knowledge are such as to render that opinion reasonable.
Now are the statements here statements which involve such a representation
of material facts? They are statements on a subject as to
which <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> the vendors know everything and the purchasers
nothing. The vendors state that the property is let to a most desirable
tenant; what does that mean? I agree that it is not a guarantee
that the tenant will go on paying his rent, but it is to my mind a
guarantee of a different sort, and amounts at least to an assertion that
nothing has occurred in the relations between the landlords and the
tenant which can be considered to make the tenant an unsatisfactory
one. This is an assertion of a specific fact. Was it a true assertion?
Having regard to what took place between Lady Day and Midsummer,
I think that it was not. On the 25th of March, a quarter’s rent became
due. On the 1st of May, it was wholly unpaid and a distress
was threatened. The tenant wrote to ask for time. The plaintiffs
replied that the rent could not be allowed to remain over Whitsuntide.
The tenant paid on the 6th of May £30, on the 13th of June £40, and
the remaining £30 shortly before the auction. Now could it, at the
time of the auction, be said that nothing had occurred to make Fleck
an undesirable tenant? In my opinion a tenant who had paid his last
quarter’s rent by driblets under pressure must be regarded as an undesirable
tenant.<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c015'><sup>[334]</sup></a></p>

  <h4 class='c013'>KIDNEY <em>v.</em> STODDARD<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, October Term, 1843.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 7 Metcalf, 252.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Trespass upon the case for an alleged fraudulent representation by
the defendant as to the credit of his son, Alden D. Stoddard, Jr., in
the following letter to F. Delano of New York: “Fairhaven, 9 mo.
27, 1841. Franklin Delano, Esq. My dear Sir: The bearer, my son,
A. D. Stoddard, Jr., wishes to purchase a bill of goods in your city.
Any assistance you can render him, by a recommendation or otherwise,
will be gratefully received by him, and much oblige your obedient
servant, who will take the liberty to say that A. D. S. Jr.’s contracts,
of whatever nature, will unquestionably be punctually attended to.
Very respectfully your friend, A. D. Stoddard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial before Wilde, J., one Ammidon testified that he was
agent of the plaintiffs; that Stoddard, Jr., called on him in New
York, about the 1st of October, 1841, to purchase some goods, and
referred him to Delano; that the witness called on Delano, who
showed said letter to him, and made statements concerning Stoddard,
Senior. The witness sold the son goods which he would not have sold
him, if it had not been for the letter and the statements of Delano. No
part of the debt was ever paid. After the sale the plaintiff discovered
that the son was a minor at the time the letter was written.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge instructed the jury that when a party intentionally conceals
a material fact, in giving a letter of recommendation, it amounts
to a false representation; that the defendant, giving a letter in this
case to an unlimited amount, was bound to communicate every material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>fact; that if he concealed the fact that the son was a minor, with
the view to give him a credit, knowing or believing that he would not
get a credit if that fact was known, it was a fraud, and the plaintiff
was entitled to recover; that it was immaterial whether there was any
moral fraud; and that every man was presumed to know the consequences
of his own acts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant’s counsel requested the judge to instruct the jury,
that if the defendant gave his opinion merely, he was not bound to
communicate any facts; and that if he gave an honest opinion, he was
not liable. But the judge refused so to instruct the jury. It was also
contended by the defendant’s counsel that the plaintiffs should have
made an effort to recover the debt of the son.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs for the amount of the
goods sold, and the defendant moved for a new trial, on the ground
that the jury were misdirected in matter of law.<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c015'><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Hubbard, J.</span></p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>It is very certain, as has been maintained by the defendant’s counsel,
that a mistaken opinion, honestly given, can never be taken as a
fraudulent representation. This is true in principle, and supported
abundantly by authorities. But the misfortune of the defendant’s
case is, that the verdict of the jury rests not on the honest mistake of
the defendant, but upon the ground of material concealment of a fact
especially within his knowledge; a fact important to be known, as it
regarded the credit of the son; a fact designedly concealed, and with
the view of obtaining that credit for the son, which he, the father,
knew or believed he could not obtain if that fact were known.</p>

<p class='c007'>It needs no lengthened argument to establish the materiality of the
fact. The result of this case is a sufficient witness of it. The plaintiffs
were induced by the letter, from which this fact was carefully
excluded, to give a credit to the son, which they would not otherwise
have given; and as the direct consequence of it, they have sustained
the loss set out in the declaration. Here then are proved fraud and
deceit on the part of the defendant, and damage to the plaintiffs; and
these facts have long been held to constitute a substantial cause of
action. From the time of the judgment in the great case of Pasley <em>v.</em>
Freeman, 3 T. R. 51, to the present day, through the long line of
decisions both in England and America, the principle of that case,
though with some statute modifications, remains unshaken and
unimpaired.</p>

  <h4 class='c013'>DERRY <em>v.</em> PEEK<br /> <span class='sc'>In the House of Lords, July 1, 1889.</span><br /> <em>Reported in Law Reports, 14 Appeal Cases, 337.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The action in this case was brought by Sir H. Peek against Mr. W.
Derry, the chairman, and Messrs. J. C. Wakefield, M. M. Moore, J.
Pethick, and S. J. Wilde, four of the directors of the Plymouth, Devonport,
and District Tramways Company, claiming damages for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>fraudulent misrepresentations of the defendants whereby the plaintiff
was induced to take shares in the company.<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c015'><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The company was incorporated in the year 1882 for making and
maintaining tramways in Plymouth, Devonport, and Stonehouse. The
nominal capital was £125,000 in shares of £10 each.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Plymouth, Devonport, and District Tramways Act, 1882 (45 &amp;
46 Vict. c. clix.), by which the company was incorporated, contained
the following clause (sect. 35):—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The carriages used on the tramways may, subject to the provisions
of this Act, be moved by animal power, and, with the consent of the
Board of Trade, during a period of seven years after the opening of the
same for public traffic, and with the like consent during such further
periods not exceeding seven years as the said board may from time to
time specify in any order to be signed by a secretary or an assistant
secretary of the said board, by steam-power or any mechanical power:
Provided always, that the exercise of the powers hereby conferred with
respect to the use of steam or any mechanical power shall be subject to
the regulations set forth in the Schedule A. to this Act annexed, and
to any regulations which may be added thereto or substituted therefor
by any order which the Board of Trade may and which they are hereby
empowered to make from time to time, as and when they may think
fit, for securing to the public all reasonable protection against danger
in the exercise of the powers by this Act conferred with respect to the
use of steam or any mechanical power on the tramways: Provided also,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>that the company shall not use steam-power or any mechanical power
on the said tramways unless and until they shall have obtained the
previous consent in writing of the corporations [Plymouth and Devonport]
therefor, and then for such terms only and subject to such conditions
and regulations as the corporations may from time to time
prescribe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By sect. 64 it was provided that the company should not open any of
the tramways for public traffic without the consent of the corporations.</p>

<p class='c007'>In October, 1882, the directors issued a prospectus which contained
the following paragraph: “As by sect. 35 of the Plymouth and Devonport
District Tramways Act, 1882, power is given to use either animal,
steam, or mechanical means of locomotion, the directors will adopt
that motive power which experience may demonstrate to be at once
the most economical and effective.” It did not appear that the plaintiff
ever received a copy of this prospectus.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 1st of February, 1883, the directors of the company issued a
second prospectus, which contained a heading in large type as follows:
“Incorporated by special Act of Parliament 45 &amp; 46 Vict. authorizing
the use of steam or other mechanical motive power.” The prospectus
contained the following paragraphs:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“One great feature of this undertaking, to which considerable importance
should be attached, is, that by the special Act of Parliament
obtained, the company has the right to use steam or mechanical motive
power instead of horses, and it is fully expected that by means of
this a considerable saving will result in the working expenses of the
line, as compared with other tramways worked by horses.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Looking to the exceptional advantages offered by this undertaking
from the dense population of the towns it traverses, the unusually favorable
conditions as to motive power open to the company, and the
annual dividends earned by other companies which do not enjoy such
special privileges, the directors have reason to believe that the enterprise
will prove highly remunerative, and the shares now for subscription
offer a very favorable opportunity for a sound and progressive
investment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants at the same time issued a circular letter, which was
sent with the prospectus, in which it was stated that “the company by
its Act enjoys the special privilege of the right to use steam-power
instead of horse-power, from which it is expected considerable savings
will result in the working expenses.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff received copies of this prospectus and circular, and
believing, as he alleged, that the company had an absolute right to use
steam and other mechanical power, and relying upon the representations
and statements in the prospectus and circular, applied on the 7th
of February for 400 shares, for which he paid £4000.</p>

<p class='c007'>About £40,000 only of the capital was subscribed; but the directors
completed part of their tramway in Plymouth. The corporation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>Devonport refused their consent to the company opening the completed
part until the remaining portion was ready, and on the 14th of
November, 1884, obtained an injunction restraining the company
from so doing. When the Board of Trade were applied to, they refused
to sanction the use of steam-power except over a small portion of the
tramways.</p>

<p class='c007'>The result was that the company was unable to carry out its proposed
undertaking, and a petition for winding-up was presented, which
was followed by a winding-up order on the 2d of May, 1885.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writ in this action was issued on the 4th of February, 1885, a
few days after the petition for winding-up, by Sir H. Peek, against
the chairman and directors named above, claiming in the first instance
a rescission of the contract for shares and repayment of the money
paid by him, and damages; but the writ was afterwards amended, and
claimed only damages for the misrepresentations in the prospectus and
circular.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defence pleaded by the defendants was that they did not represent,
or intend to represent, in the prospectus and circular, that the
company had an absolute right to use steam or other mechanical
power; that the plaintiff knew that the use of steam-power was never,
or seldom, given unconditionally to a tramway company, and that he
was acquainted, or might have made himself acquainted, with the provisions
of the company’s special Act, which was referred to in the
prospectus, and might be seen at the company’s office; and they denied
that the plaintiff was induced to take the shares by the representations
complained of. They also pleaded that if the statements complained
of were untrue, they were made by the defendants in good faith, and
that they had reasonable grounds for believing them to be true: that
in fact the consent of the corporation of Plymouth to the use of steam
was given in June, 1883, and the consent of the Board of Trade to its
being used in a portion of the tramways had also been given.</p>

<p class='c007'>The action came on for hearing before Mr. Justice <span class='sc'>Stirling</span>. At
this hearing the parties testified.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Stirling, J.</span>, came to the conclusion that the directors all believed
that the company had the right stated in the prospectus; and that
their belief was not unreasonable, and their proceedings so reckless
or careless, that they ought to be fixed with the consequences of deceit.
He ordered the action to be dismissed.<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c015'><sup>[338]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On appeal by plaintiff to the Court of Appeal, the judgment of <span class='sc'>Stirling,
J.</span>, was reversed by <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, <span class='sc'>Hannen</span>, and <span class='sc'>Lopes</span>, L.JJ. They
held the directors liable in this action for deceit, on the ground that
they made the statement without any reasonable ground for believing
it to be true. L. R. 37 Ch. Div. 541.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants, Derry, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et al.</span></i>, appealed from the decision of the
Court of Appeal to the House of Lords.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>The House of Lords unanimously reversed the judgment of the
Court of Appeal, and restored the order of <span class='sc'>Stirling, J.</span> Opinions
were delivered by <span class='sc'>Lords Halsbury</span>, <span class='sc'>Watson</span>, <span class='sc'>Bramwell</span>, <span class='sc'>Fitzgerald</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Herschel</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Portions of the opinion of <span class='sc'>Lord Herschell</span> are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Herschell.</span> My Lords, in the statement of claim in this
action the respondent, who is the plaintiff, alleges that the appellants
made in a prospectus issued by them certain statements which were
untrue, that they well knew that the facts were not as stated in the
prospectus, and made the representations fraudulently, and with the
view to induce the plaintiff to take shares in the company.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This action is one which is commonly called an action of deceit,
a mere common-law action.” This is the description of it given by
Cotton, L. J., in delivering judgment. I think it important that it
should be borne in mind that such an action differs essentially from
one brought to obtain rescission of a contract on the ground of misrepresentation
of a material fact. The principles which govern the
two actions differ widely. Where rescission is claimed it is only necessary
to prove that there was misrepresentation; then, however honestly
it may have been made, however free from blame the person who
made it, the contract, having been obtained by misrepresentation, cannot
stand. In an action of deceit, on the contrary, it is not enough
to establish misrepresentation alone; it is conceded on all hands that
something more must be proved to cast liability upon the defendant,
though it has been a matter of controversy what additional elements
are requisite. I lay stress upon this because observations made by
learned judges in actions for rescission have been cited and much relied
upon at the bar by counsel for the respondent. Care must obviously
be observed in applying the language used in relation to such
actions to an action of deceit. Even if the scope of the language used
extend beyond the particular action which was being dealt with, it
must be remembered that the learned judges were not engaged in determining
what is necessary to support an action of deceit, or in
discriminating with nicety the elements which enter into it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another class of actions which I must refer to also for the
purpose of putting it aside. I mean those cases where a person within
whose special province it lay to know a particular fact, has given an
erroneous answer to an inquiry made with regard to it by a person
desirous of ascertaining the fact for the purpose of determining his
course accordingly, and has been held bound to make good the assurance
he has given. Burrowes <em>v.</em> Lock, 10 Ves. 470, may be cited as
an example, where a trustee had been asked by an intended lender,
upon the security of a trust fund, whether notice of any prior incumbrance
upon the fund had been given to him. In cases like this it has
been said that the circumstance that the answer was honestly made in
the belief that it was true affords no defence to the action. Lord Selborne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>pointed out in Brownlie <em>v.</em> Campbell, 5 App. Cas. p. 935, that
these cases were in an altogether different category from actions to
recover damages for false representation, such as we are now dealing
with.</p>

<p class='c007'>One other observation I have to make before proceeding to consider
the law which has been laid down by the learned judges in the Court of
Appeal in the case before your Lordships. “An action of deceit is a
common-law action, and must be decided on the same principles,
whether it be brought in the Chancery Division or any of the Common
Law Divisions, there being, in my opinion, no such thing as an equitable
action for deceit.” This was the language of Cotton, L. J., in
Arkwright <em>v.</em> Newbould, 17 Ch. D. 320. It was adopted by Lord
Blackburn in Smith <em>v.</em> Chadwick, 9 App. Cas. 193, and is not, I think,
open to dispute.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Court below Cotton, L. J., said: “What in my opinion is a
correct statement of the law is this, that where a man makes a statement
to be acted upon by others which is false, and which is known by
him to be false, or is made by him recklessly, or without care whether
it is true or false, that is, without any reasonable ground for believing
it to be true, he is liable in an action of deceit at the suit of any one to
whom it was addressed, or any one of the class to whom it was addressed,
and who was materially induced by the misstatement to do
an act to his prejudice.” About much that is here stated there cannot,
I think, be two opinions. But when the learned Lord Justice speaks
of a statement made recklessly or without care whether it is true or
false, that is, without any reasonable ground for believing it to be true,
I find myself, with all respect, unable to agree that these are convertible
expressions. To make a statement, careless whether it be true
or false, and therefore without any real belief in its truth, appears to
me to be an essentially different thing from making, through want of
care, a false statement, which is nevertheless honestly believed to be
true. And it is surely conceivable that a man may believe that what
he states is the fact, though he has been so wanting in care that the
Court may think that there were no sufficient grounds to warrant his
belief. I shall have to consider hereafter whether the want of reasonable
ground for believing the statement made is sufficient to support
an action of deceit. I am only concerned for the moment to point out
that it does not follow that it is so, because there is authority for saying
that a statement made recklessly, without caring whether it be
true or false, affords sufficient foundation for such an action.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>It will thus be seen that all the learned judges [in the Court of Appeal]
concurred in thinking that it was sufficient to prove that the
representations made were not in accordance with fact, and that the
person making them had no reasonable ground for believing them.
They did not treat the absence of such reasonable ground as evidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>merely that the statements were made recklessly, careless whether
they were true or false, and without belief that they were true, but
they adopted as the test of liability, not the existence of belief in the
truth of the assertions made, but whether the belief in them was
founded upon any reasonable grounds. It will be seen, further, that
the Court did not purport to be establishing any new doctrine. They
deemed that they were only following the cases already decided, and
that the proposition which they concurred in laying down was established
by prior authorities. Indeed, Lopes, L. J., expressly states
the law in this respect to be well settled. This renders a close and
critical examination of the earlier authorities necessary.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>Having now drawn attention, I believe, to all the cases having a
material bearing upon the question under consideration, I proceed to
state briefly the conclusions to which I have been led. I think the
authorities establish the following propositions: First, in order to
sustain an action of deceit there must be proof of fraud, and nothing
short of that will suffice. Secondly, fraud is proved when it is shown
that a false representation has been made (1) knowingly, or (2) without
belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or
false. Although I have treated the second and third as distinct cases,
I think the third is but an instance of the second, for one who makes
a statement under such circumstances can have no real belief in the
truth of what he states. To prevent a false statement being fraudulent
there must, I think, always be an honest belief in its truth. And this
probably covers the whole ground, for one who knowingly alleges that
which is false has obviously no such honest belief.<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c015'><sup>[339]</sup></a> Thirdly, if fraud
be proved, the motive of the person guilty of it is immaterial. It matters
not that there was no intention to cheat or injure the person to
whom the statement was made.</p>

<p class='c007'>I think these propositions embrace all that can be supported by
decided cases from the time of Pasley <em>v.</em> Freeman, 2 Smith’s L. C. 74,
down to Western Bank of Scotland <em>v.</em> Addie, Law Rep. 1 H. L. Sc.
145, in 1867, when the first suggestion is to be found that belief in the
truth of what he has stated will not suffice to absolve the defendant if
his belief be based on no reasonable grounds. I have shown that this
view was at once dissented from by Lord Cranworth, so that there was
at the outset as much authority against it as for it. And I have met
with no further assertion of Lord Chelmsford’s view until the case of
Weir <em>v.</em> Bell, 3 Ex. D. 238, where it seems to be involved in Lord Justice
Cotton’s enunciation of the law of deceit. But no reason is there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>given in support of the view, it is treated as established law. The
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictum</span></i> of the late Master of the Rolls, that a false statement made
through carelessness, which the person making it ought to have known
to be untrue, would sustain an action of deceit, carried the matter still
further. But that such an action could be maintained notwithstanding
an honest belief that the statement made was true, if there were no
reasonable grounds for the belief, was, I think, for the first time decided
in the case now under appeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my opinion making a false statement through want of care falls
far short of, and is a very different thing from, fraud, and the same
may be said of a false representation honestly believed though on insufficient
grounds. Indeed Cotton, L. J., himself indicated, in the
words I have already quoted, that he should not call it fraud. But the
whole current of authorities, with which I have so long detained your
Lordships, shows to my mind conclusively that fraud is essential to
found an action of deceit, and that it cannot be maintained where the
acts proved cannot properly be so termed. And the case of Taylor <em>v.</em>
Ashton, 11 M. &amp; W. 401, appears to me to be in direct conflict with
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictum</span></i> of Sir George Jessel, and inconsistent with the view taken
by the learned judges in the Court below. I observe that Sir Frederick
Pollock, in his able work on Torts (p. 243, note), referring, I presume,
to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</span></i> of Cotton, L. J., and Sir George Jessel, M. R., says that
the actual decision in Taylor <em>v.</em> Ashton, 11 M. &amp; W. 401, is not consistent
with the modern cases on the duty of directors of companies.
I think he is right. But for the reasons I have given I am unable to
hold that anything less than fraud will render directors or any other
persons liable to an action of deceit.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time I desire to say distinctly that when a false statement
has been made the questions whether there were reasonable
grounds for believing it, and what were the means of knowledge in the
possession of the person making it, are most weighty matters for consideration.
The ground upon which an alleged belief was founded is a
most important test of its reality. I can conceive many cases where
the fact that an alleged belief was destitute of all reasonable foundation
would suffice of itself to convince the Court that it was not really
entertained, and that the representation was a fraudulent one. So,
too, although means of knowledge are, as was pointed out by Lord
Blackburn in Brownlie <em>v.</em> Campbell, 5 App. Cas. p. 952, a very different
thing from knowledge, if I thought that a person making a false
statement had shut his eyes to the facts, or purposely abstained from
inquiring into them I should hold that honest belief was absent, and
that he was just as fraudulent as if he had knowingly stated that
which was false.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have arrived with some reluctance at the conclusion to which I
have felt myself compelled, for I think those who put before the public
a prospectus to induce them to embark their money in a commercial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_571'>571</span>enterprise ought to be vigilant to see that it contains such representations
only as are in strict accordance with fact, and I should be very
unwilling to give any countenance to the contrary idea. I think there
is much to be said for the view that this moral duty ought to some
extent to be converted into a legal obligation, and that the want of
reasonable care to see that statements made under such circumstances
are true should be made an actionable wrong. But this is not a matter
fit for discussion on the present occasion. If it is to be done the legislature
must intervene and expressly give a right of action in respect of
such a departure from duty. It ought not, I think, to be done by
straining the law, and holding that to be fraudulent which the tribunal
feels cannot properly be so described. I think mischief is likely to
result from blurring the distinction between carelessness and fraud,
and equally holding a man fraudulent whether his acts can or cannot
be justly so designated.</p>

<p class='c007'>It now remains for me to apply what I believe to be the law to the
facts of the present case. [After reviewing the evidence of each defendant.]
I cannot hold it proved as to any one of them that he
knowingly made a false statement, or one which he did not believe to
be true, or was careless whether what he stated was true or false. In
short, I think they honestly believed that what they asserted was true,<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c015'><sup>[340]</sup></a>
and I am of opinion that the charge of fraud made against them has
not been established. [Remainder of opinion omitted.]<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c015'><sup>[341]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>If I were making the law, I should not hold a man answerable for representations
made in the common affairs of life without bad faith in some sense, if
no consideration was given for them, although it would be hard to reconcile
even that proposition with some of our cases. But the proposition, even if
accepted, seems to me not to apply to this case. The proper meaning of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>words used by the defendant has been settled by this court already. 159
Mass. 437. The representation was not made in casual talk, but in a business
matter, for the very purpose of inducing others to lay out their money on the
faith of it. When a man makes such a representation, he knows that others
will understand his words according to their usual and proper meaning, and
not by the accident of what he happens to have in his head, and it seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>me one of the first principles of social intercourse that he is bound at his
peril to know what that meaning is. In this respect it seems to me that there
is no difference between the law of fraud and that of other torts, or of contract
or estoppel. If the language of fiction be preferred, a man is conclusively
presumed in all parts of the law to contemplate the natural consequences of
his act, as well in the conduct of others as in mechanical results. I can see
no difference in principle between an invitation by words and an invitation by
other acts, such as opening the gates of a railroad crossing (Brow <em>v.</em> Boston &amp;
Albany Railroad, 157 Mass. 399), or an intentional gesture, having as its
manifest consequence, according to common experience, a start and a fall
on the part of the person toward whom it is directed, in either of which cases
I suppose no one would say that a defendant could get off by proving that
he did not anticipate the natural interpretation of the sign. Of course, if the
words used are technical, or have a peculiar meaning in the place where they
were used, this can be shown; if by the context, or the subject matter, or
the circumstances, the customary meaning of the words is modified, this can
be shown by proof of the circumstances, the subject matter, and the context;
but when none of these things appears, a defendant cannot be heard to say
that for some undisclosed reason he had in his mind, and intended to express
by the words, something different from what the words appear to mean, and
were understood by the plaintiff to mean, and are interpreted by the court to
mean, whether the action be in tort or contract.</p>

<p class='c019'>Neither, in my opinion, are there any peculiar safeguards set up about the
action for deceit. That action was given by the common law for any false
statement of present facts of which the defendant took the risk, and which
was followed by damage. He might take the risk at different points in different
cases. A false warranty used to be laid as a deceit in tort for a false
and fraudulent representation. Clift, Entries, 932, pl. 40. Liber Placitandi,
40, pl. 54, 55. Y. B. 11 Ed. IV. pl. 10. So even an implied warranty. Brown
<em>v.</em> Edgington, 2 Man. &amp; G. 279. See Y. B. 11 Ed. IV. 6 b; Keilw. 91, pl. 16.
Yet it was not necessary to lay the scienter, or if you laid it, to prove it, for
the plain reason, as Shaw, C. J., puts it, in substance, that the defendant is
answerable for the facts, however honest he may have been. Norton <em>v.</em> Doherty,
3 Gray, 372, 373. Schuchardt <em>v.</em> Allens, 1 Wall. 359, 368. Williamson
<em>v.</em> Allison, 2 East, 446. Gresham <em>v.</em> Postan, 2 C. &amp; P. 540. Denison <em>v.</em> Ralphson,
1 Vent. 365, 366. In the last century an alternative form in assumpsit
was introduced (Stuart <em>v.</em> Wilkins, 1 Doug. 18, 21, Lawrence, J., and Williamson
<em>v.</em> Allison, 2 East, 446, 451), and it may be that now we should require the
warranty to be alleged, which has the advantage of telling the defendant more
exactly what the case is against him. Cooper <em>v.</em> Landon, 102 Mass. 58. But
there is no doubt about the common law. I am of opinion, as I have stated,
that in a case like the present a man takes the risk of the interpretation of
his words as it may afterwards be settled by the court.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Hand, J., in</span> SLATER TRUST COMPANY <em>v.</em> GARDINER<br /> (1910) <cite>183 Federal Reporter, 268, 270–271.</cite></h4>

<p class='c022'>At the outset the character of the mistake must be observed. Gardiner
knew the facts, but he did not know the meaning of the words. Although the
great weight of authority is to the contrary (Derry <em>v.</em> Peek, 14 App. Cas.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>337), I may assume for the purposes of this case that a man may be responsible
for his uttered false words, even when he believes them to be true.</p>

<p class='c019'>Such authorities as hold to this rule regard the uttered word as the cause
of the damage, which, of course, it is, and they hold that a man, by speaking
or writing words on which he knows others will rely, must be held to their
truth quite as much as though he made a promise (Mr. Justice Holmes, dissentiente,
Nash <em>v.</em> Minnesota Title Co., 163 Mass. 574, 40 N. E. 1039, 28
L. R. A. 753, 47 Am. St. Rep. 489; Pollock on Torts, [6th Ed.] page 283).
But these authorities, which regard the word as the tortious act, certainly
should not, in analogy with the other law of torts, be supposed to mean that a
man should be responsible for the remote results of his words. The extent of
his responsibility, indeed, ought to be limited, as it is in other torts, to those
matters which would come within the foresight of the hypothetical reasonable
man. With remoter damage it is as unjust to charge the words of his mouth
as the movements of his legs or arms. Although they do not in these words
indicate the distinction, I think that this is the explanation of such of the
cases as make negligence the test, and of these there are a number.</p>

<p class='c019'>If Gardiner was responsible for the words he uttered, regardless of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i>,
at least he was not responsible for such consequences as no man could avoid
with the use of reasonable care. What happened in spite of the exercise of
such care was remote, within all the analogies of the law of torts. “Causa
proxima non remota spectatur.” Nor does it make any difference that it was
in respect of the meaning of his words that he was mistaken. The utterance
of a word is one thing; its eventual interpretation by a reader is another, and
is as much the external consequence of its utterance as anything else. A given
interpretation, even a legal one, may be, from the point of view of the original
utterer, so remote a consequence that no one ought in justice to be held accountable
for it. For example, in the case at bar, if Gardiner did all a layman
could do to get the facts set down correctly, the interpretation that J. T.
Woodward put on the words Gardiner was not bound to anticipate, not even
if it was the right one.</p>

<p class='c019'>The authorities do not make any distinction between the discrepancy of the
statement with the facts stated and the discrepancy of the statement with its
subsequent interpretation. Thus in Derry <em>v.</em> Peek, 14 App. Cas. 337, it appeared
that the directors who issued the prospectus knew all the facts and
trusted their solicitors to prepare the statement correctly (see Lord Bramwell’s
judgment, page 348); their misstatement was in calling the franchise
absolute which was in fact conditional. This statement they successfully justified,
because they regarded the condition attached to the franchise as
practically certain of fulfilment and the statement really truthful (Lord
Herschell’s Judgment, pages 378, 379). The point is that the error was in supposing
that the facts which they knew were correctly set forth in the statement.
A similar case, where the exact point was passed on by the Supreme
Court of Massachusetts, is Nash <em>v.</em> Minnesota Title Co., 163 Mass. 574, 40 N.
E. 1039, 28 L. R. A. 753, 47 Am. St. Rep. 489, the dissent in which I have
already mentioned. But that dissent proceeds upon the theory that no
scienter is ever necessary in an action for deceit.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>Holcomb <em>v.</em> Noble, 69 Mich. 396, 37 N. W. 497, is also in point. There defendant
and plaintiff exchanged lands. In making this exchange plaintiff
relied on certain representations of fact respecting the pine on the land transferred
to him by defendant. These representations were based—and this
was understood by plaintiff—upon the reports of a land looker, and defendant
told plaintiff “that all he knew about the land was what he learned from
the land looker.” Defendant believed these representations to be true. They
were in fact false, and plaintiff sustained damages by his reliance thereon.
An action of fraud was brought, and it was held that plaintiff could recover.
There were two opinions in the case, one written by Justice Campbell and
concurred in by Justice Champlin, one written by Justice Morse and concurred
in by Chief Justice Sherwood. In the opinion of Justice Campbell it
is said: “It is admitted that in equity an actual design to mislead is not
necessary if a party is actually misled by another in a bargain. There was
abundant evidence in this case to authorize the jury to find that defendant,
whether honestly or dishonestly, expected plaintiff to act on his representations
of the reliableness of the reports which he produced, and that plaintiff
did rely on them. There is no reason for a difference in action, in such cases,
between courts of law and courts of equity. Where an equitable cause of
grievance exists, it in no way differs from a legal one, unless a different remedy
is needed. A court of law cannot cancel a contract, and for such a purpose the
equitable remedy must be sought. But where the relief desired is compensation
for the wrong, the equitable remedy is much less appropriate, and an action
in equity for mere damages will generally be denied, but denied only
because the legal remedy is better. If there could be no legal remedy, there
can be no doubt that equity would act. If the fraud is such that it creates a
right of action anywhere, an action must lie on the case where a money judgment
is needed.” I now quote from the opinion of Justice Morse, concurred in
by Chief Justice Sherwood: “I was strongly impressed, upon the argument
of this case, with the theory of the defendant, supported by abundant authority
outside of our own state, that unless the jury found that the representations
relied upon by the plaintiff as false were made by the defendant, Noble,
knowing them to be false, or he made the statements as facts within his own
knowledge, when he was ignorant of the truth or falsity of them, he could
not be held liable in this action; that if he told plaintiff that he had never
seen the lands, but that he had had the same examined by a competent land
looker, who said that there were 5,000,000 feet of pine on the land, and made
no representations as of his own knowledge, the plaintiff could not recover.
A subsequent careful examination of the case and the authorities cited by
defendant’s counsel has but confirmed me in the correctness and justness of
his claim. I am satisfied that the law ought not to make a different contract
for the seller than he sees fit to make for himself, and hold him in effect, for
warranties that he never made. But an equally careful examination of the
cases adjudicated in this state satisfies me that the doctrine is settled here, by
a long line of cases, that if there was in fact a misrepresentation, though
made innocently, and its deceptive influence was effective, the consequences to
the plaintiff being as serious as though it had proceeded from a vicious purpose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>he would have a right of action for the damages caused thereby either at
law or in equity. Baughman <em>v.</em> Gould, 45 Mich. 483, 8 N. W. 73; Converse
<em>v.</em> Blumrich, 14 Mich. 109, 90 Am. Dec. 230; Steinbach <em>v.</em> Hill, 25 Mich. 78;
Webster <em>v.</em> Bailey, 31 Mich. 36; Starkweather <em>v.</em> Benjamin, 32 Mich. 305;
Beebe <em>v.</em> Knapp, 28 Mich. 53.” I think these decisions are indistinguishable
from the case at bar, and require us to say that the trial court erred in
directing a verdict for the defendant. The Busch Case and the Holcomb Case
cannot be distinguished from the case under consideration by saying that in
them “the principal adopted the agent’s estimate as his own.” For in this
case, as heretofore stated, defendant asserted to plaintiff “that those representations
Barnard had made were true.” It might therefore be said in this
case, then, the principal adopted the agent’s estimate as his own.</p>

<p class='c019'>Our attention is called to Krause <em>v.</em> Cook, 144 Mich. 365, 108 N. W. 81.
There defendant, acting for one Parker, sold mining stock to the plaintiff.
Certain false representations were made, and an action to recover damages for
fraud was brought. It was held that the trial court should have given the
following instruction: “If a person received information from others, and believes
it, repeats it, explaining that he has no personal knowledge, he is not
guilty of fraud. Therefore, if you find that the defendant received information
from others, and repeated that information to plaintiff, and explained to
plaintiff the sources of his information, he is not guilty of any fraud, if he
acts honestly and in good faith.” At first blush it would seem, that this principle
is opposed to the decisions of Holcomb <em>v.</em> Noble and Busch <em>v.</em> Wilcox,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>. And it must be admitted, I think, that if this principle had been applied
in those cases, a different conclusion would there have been reached. If
there was no difference in the facts, it might be said that Krause <em>v.</em> Cook,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, is opposed to the principle announced in the Busch and Holcomb Cases.
But there is a difference in the cases, and, in my judgment, such a difference
as to require a different rule of law. In the Holcomb and Busch Cases the
defendant himself obtained what plaintiff lost by means of the false representations.
In the Krause Case the defendant was an agent, who at most received
only 10 per cent of the damages caused by the false representations.
This difference, in my judgment, places the Krause Case outside the rule of
the Holcomb and Busch Cases. That rule is peculiarly a Michigan rule.
Elsewhere in order to create liability for deceit, it must be shown that “the
person making the statement, or the person responsible for it, either knows it
to be untrue, or is culpably ignorant (that is, recklessly and consciously
ignorant) whether it be true or not.” See Webb’s Pollock on Torts, p. 355. In
Michigan we have held (see cases cited in the opinion of Justice Morse in the
Holcomb Case, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>) that in order to constitute a fraud it is not necessary
that the person making the statement should either know that it is untrue or
be recklessly and consciously ignorant whether it be true or not. It is sufficient
if it be false in fact. It must be said, however, that in the cases in which
this principle has been applied the defendant obtained what the false representations
caused the plaintiff to lose. Applied in such cases, the principle is a
just and salutary one. This may be illustrated by the Holcomb Case—which
is a typical case. There, because plaintiff Holcomb credited a certain false
statement of fact, he paid defendant Noble more for land purchased than
otherwise he would have paid. The false statement of fact was an agency
whereby the property of the plaintiff was transferred to defendant. The law
would be justly subject to reproach if it afforded no redress in such case. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_578'>578</span>Michigan the law does give redress in such a case, and that redress may be obtained
in an action for fraud. It may seem somewhat unjust to characterize
such conduct as fraudulent, but the court was apparently placed in the
dilemma of either so characterizing it or of altogether denying compensation,
and it chose the least objectionable of these two alternatives. This principle,
which is altogether just in its application to cases where the loss of the plaintiff
has inured to the profit of the defendant, would be most unjust if applied to
cases where the defendant has obtained no such profit. This may be illustrated
by taking a concrete case, and I take a case even plainer in its facts
than the Krause Case. Let us suppose that, with commendable motives and
in the best of faith, one friend communicates to another with all amplitude of
detail certain information he has received respecting a mine, which it is known
that neither of them has ever visited. The object of this communication is to
induce the one to whom it is made to purchase stock, but not from the one
making the communication, but from a third person having no relation to him.
The stock is purchased accordingly, without any profit resulting to the friend
making the communication; the information proves to be false and the stock
worthless. Did the friend who communicated the information which proved
to be false commit a fraud? He did no moral wrong. Indeed, from a moral
point of view his conduct was commendable, and, unless compelled to do so,
the court should not announce a rule of law which penalizes commendable conduct.
Are we compelled to declare that there exists a rule of law which makes
such conduct fraudulent? Manifestly not unless we are bound to declare
that the doctrine of the Holcomb and Busch Cases applies. Must we so
declare? As already pointed out, the case differs materially from the Holcomb
and Busch Cases, and this difference is such that the doctrine of those
cases has no just application. That doctrine was designed to accomplish justice:
as applied in the Holcomb and Busch Cases and in similar cases it does
accomplish justice. As applied to cases where the loss of the plaintiff has not
inured to the profit of the defendant it accomplishes an injustice, and it therefore
has no application to such cases.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Lord Haldane, L. C., in</span> NOCTON <em>v.</em> LORD ASHBURTON<br /> (1914) <cite>Appeal Cases, 932, 945–946, 951–954.</cite></h4>

<p class='c022'>I have read the evidence of the appellant, and, although it is obviously unreliable
evidence, it leaves on my mind the same impression that it left on
that of the learned judge who heard it, that the solicitor did not consciously
intend to defraud his client, but, largely owing to a confused state of mind,
believed that he was properly joining with him and guiding him in a good
speculation.</p>

<p class='c019'>I cannot, therefore, treat the case, so far as based on intention to deceive,
as made out. But where I differ from the learned judges in the Courts below
is as to their view that, if they did not regard deceit as proved, the only alternative
was to treat the action as one of mere negligence at law unconnected
with misconduct. This alternative they thought was precluded by the way
the case had been conducted. I am not sure that, on the pleadings and on the
facts proved, they were right even in this. The question might well have been
treated as in their discretion and as properly one of costs only, having regard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>to the unsatisfactory evidence of the appellant. But I do not take the view
that they were shut up within the dilemma they supposed. There is a third
form of procedure to which the statement of claim approximated very closely,
and that is the old bill in Chancery to enforce compensation for breach of a
fiduciary obligation. There appears to have been an impression that the
necessity which recent authorities have established of proving moral fraud in
order to succeed in an action of deceit has narrowed the scope of this remedy.
For the reasons which I am about to offer to your Lordships, I do not think
that this is so....</p>

<p class='c019'>My Lords, it is known that in cases of actual fraud the Courts of Chancery
and of Common Law exercised a concurrent jurisdiction from the earliest
times. For some of these cases the greater freedom which, in early days, the
Court of Chancery exercised in admitting the testimony of parties to the proceedings
made it a more suitable tribunal. Moreover, its remedies were more
elastic. Operating <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in personam</span></i> as a Court of conscience it could order the
defendant, not, indeed, in those days, to pay damages as such, but to make
restitution, or to compensate the plaintiff by putting him in as good a position
pecuniarily as that in which he was before the injury.</p>

<p class='c019'>But in addition to this concurrent jurisdiction, the Court of Chancery exercised
an exclusive jurisdiction in cases which, although classified in that
Court as cases of fraud, yet did not necessarily import the element of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolus
malus</span></i>. The Court took upon itself to prevent a man from acting against the
dictates of conscience as defined by the Court, and to grant injunctions in
anticipation of injury, as well as relief where injury had been done. Common
instances of this exclusive jurisdiction are cases arising out of breach of duty
by persons standing in a fiduciary relation, such as the solicitor to the client,
illustrated by Lord Hardwicke’s judgment in Chesterfield <em>v.</em> Janssen, 2 Ves.
Sen. 125. I can hardly imagine that those who took part in the decision of
Derry <em>v.</em> Peek, 14 App. Cas. 337, imagined that they could be supposed to
have cast doubt on the principle of any cases arising under the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery. No such case was before the House,
which was dealing only with a case of actual fraud as to which the jurisdiction
in equity was concurrent....</p>

<p class='c019'>So far as the equity jurisdiction in cases of what is called fraud is concurrent
only and exercised in actions for mere deceit apart from breach of special
duty, an actual intention to cheat has now to be proved. But there are cases
of other classes to which, as I have already said, the Court of Chancery undoubtedly
did apply the term fraud, although I think unfortunately.</p>

<p class='c019'>Fraud in such cases is, as James, L. J., said in Torrance <em>v.</em> Bolton, L. R.
8 Ch. 118, at p. 124, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen generalissimum</span></i>, and it must not be construed so
as to mislead persons into the notion that contracts for the sale and purchase
of lands are in any respect privileged, so as to be free from the ordinary jurisdiction
of the Court to deal with them as it deals with any instrument, or any
other transactions, in which the Court is of opinion that it is unconscientious
for a person to avail himself of the legal advantage which he has obtained.
Indeed, the books are full of cases in which the Court has dealt with contracts
of that kind—contracts obtained by persons from others over whom they
have dominion, contracts obtained by persons in a fiduciary position, contracts
for the sale of shares obtained by directors through misrepresentation
contained in the prospectus, in respect of which it was never necessary to
allege or prove that the directors were wilfully guilty of moral fraud in what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>they had done.” In Chancery the term “fraud” thus came to be used to
describe what fell short of deceit, but imported breach of a duty to which
equity had attached its sanction. What was laid down by Lord Eldon in this
House in Bulkely <em>v.</em> Wilford, 2 Cl. &amp; F. 102, at p. 177, explains the nature of
the duty.</p>

<p class='c019'>My Lords, I have dealt thus fully with this distinction because I think
that confusion has arisen from overlooking it. It must now be taken to be
settled that nothing short of proof of a fraudulent intention in the strict sense
will suffice for an action of deceit. This is so whether a Court of Law or a
court of equity in the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction is dealing with the
claim, and in this strict sense it was quite natural that Lord Bramwell and
Lord Herschell should say that there was no such thing as legal as distinguished
from moral fraud. But when fraud is referred to in the wider sense
in which the books are full of the expression, used in Chancery in describing
cases which were within its exclusive jurisdiction, it is a mistake to suppose
that an actual intention to cheat must always be proved. A man may misconceive
the extent of the obligation which a Court of Equity imposes on him.
His fault is that he has violated, however innocently because of his ignorance,
an obligation which he must be taken by the Court to have known, and his
conduct has in that sense always been called fraudulent, even in such a case as
a technical fraud on a power. It was thus that the expression “constructive
fraud” came into existence. The trustee who purchases the trust estate, the
solicitor who makes a bargain with his client that cannot stand, have all for
several centuries run the risk of the word fraudulent being applied to them.
What it really means in this connection is, not moral fraud in the ordinary
sense, but breach of the sort of obligation which is enforced by a Court that
from the beginning regarded itself as a Court of conscience.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Kay, L. J., in</span> LOW <em>v.</em> BOUVERIE<br /> (1891) <cite>3 Chancery, 82, 111–113.</cite></h4>

<p class='c014'>The result of the authorities seems to be as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. There has been from ancient time a jurisdiction in Courts of Equity in
certain cases to enforce a personal demand against one who made an untrue
representation upon which he knew that the person to whom it was made intended
to act, if such person did act upon the faith of it and suffered loss by
so acting.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. This was readily done where the representation was fraudulently made,
in which case an action of deceit would lie at law.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Relief will also be given at Law and in Equity, even though the representation
was innocently made without fraud, in all cases where the suit will
be effective if the defendant is estopped from denying the truth of his representation.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Where there is no estoppel, an innocent misrepresentation will not support
an action at law for damages occasioned thereby.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Estoppel is effective where an action must succeed or fail if the defendant
or plaintiff is prevented from disputing a particular fact alleged: for example,
if an assign of A. sues A.’s trustee to recover the fund assigned, and the
trustee is prevented from denying its existence in his hands; or at law, if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>assign of a debt should sue the alleged debtor and he was prevented from denying
that the debt was due. Or, in the converse case, an estoppel may be a
defence; as if a joint stock company were to sue a shareholder for calls and
they were estopped from denying that the shares were paid up, their action
would fail.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is obvious that this rule does not apply to an action for deceit. In such
an action the plaintiff relies, not on the truth of the statement, but upon its
falsehood; and he is bound to prove, not only that the representation was
untrue, but also that it was made fraudulently. Derry <em>v.</em> Peek, 14 App. Cas.
337, very well illustrates the difference. It was an action by a person who
had been induced to take shares in a joint stock company by an untrue statement
in a prospectus. The action was not against the company, but against
the directors who had issued the prospectus. The representation was not
fraudulently made. Preventing the defendants from denying the truth of
their representation would not enable the plaintiff to succeed in such an
action; so that the plaintiff could not rely on estoppel. That could only be
if the defence had been that the statement was inaccurate, and the defendants
were estopped from denying the accuracy of their own statement. The
plaintiff’s case was not that the statement must be treated as accurate: on
that supposition he could not have had any relief against the defendants. The
plaintiff sued the defendants upon the ground that the statement was false,
and false to their knowledge—that is, fraudulent; and the defence that
prevailed was that, if it was inaccurate, it was not fraudulent.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. I am not satisfied that relief in the nature of a personal demand against
the defendant has been given in Equity in cases which did not involve fraud
or to which this doctrine of estoppel would not apply. Slim <em>v.</em> Croucher,
1 D. F. &amp; J. 518, is the only instance I know of; and, as Lord Campbell said
that there might be relief at law in that case, he probably considered, either
that it was a case of estoppel, or that an action of deceit would lie—which
latter view is not consistent with Derry <em>v.</em> Peek, 14 App. Cas. 337.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Farwell, L. J., in</span> FRY <em>v.</em> SMELLIE<br /> (1912) <cite>3 King’s Bench Division, 282, 294–295.</cite></h4>

<p class='c014'>I can only say that certificates and a blank transfer are in everyday use as
securities for raising money, and that every man who lends money to A. on
documents which show a title in B. is of course put on inquiry. This does
not mean that he must refuse to deal with the agent at all but must refer
to the principal, but that he must make such inquiry as is reasonable under
the circumstances. If he is foolish enough to lend to A. without inquiry, and
A. has no right or authority to deal with the documents, he loses his money,
and it is perfectly immaterial whether the security is a deposit of title deeds
to real estate or certificates of shares with a blank transfer. Such a question
as arises in the present case can only arise when the owner of the property has
authorized such a dealing with the property as is corroborated by the possession
of the indicia of title. If no authority at all has in fact been given it is
quite immaterial whether the lender inquires and is given an untrue answer
or does not inquire at all; in either case he loses his money. But if the owner
has in fact given the borrower authority to deal with the property by way of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>loan or by way of sale, and has entrusted him with the indicia of title, enabling
him so to deal, then the owner cannot be heard to say that there is any
limit on the authority so given. If the indicia of title are apparently co-extensive
with the authority claimed there is nothing to suggest any limit.
The estoppel arises out of the conduct of the owner of the property. Estoppel
is merely a rule of evidence which prevents the person estopped from giving
certain facts in evidence. If A.’s conduct amounts to an invitation to B. to
advance money to C. without limit on the title deeds of A.’s property, he cannot
be heard to say that he had imposed on C. a limit, any more than if he
had written or said to B. that he had given C. authority to borrow money and
had not mentioned any limit. If he has simply deposited his deeds with C.
such deposit involves no such representation, and there is therefore no such
estoppel. In speaking of estoppel, I am referring to the doctrine of estoppel
by representation which Lord Macnaghten, in Whitechurch <em>v.</em> Cavanagh,
[1902] A. C. 117, at p. 130, says “is a very old head of equity.” (See Low <em>v.</em>
Bouverie, [1891] 3 Ch. 82.) It is sometimes called equitable estoppel or a rule
of equity, and has been expressed in some of the cases as the rule which compels
a man to make good his representations of fact, in reliance on which the
person to whom they have been made for the purpose of inducing him to act
on them has so acted. Indeed equitable estoppel is the only way in which this
doctrine of making good representations has survived the decision in Derry <em>v.</em>
Peek, 14 App. Cas. 337. The circumstances must necessarily be such as to
show a duty to some one to disclose fully on the person making the representation,
but it is not a question of negligence in the sense that an action for damages
would lie at common law, and no bill in equity would ever have been filed
for damages.<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c015'><sup>[342]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>[After citing Wheeler <em>v.</em> Baars, 33 Florida, 696.]</p>

<p class='c007'>It is there said that the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i> may be proved by showing, first,
actual knowledge of the falsity of the representation by defendant;
second, that defendant made the statement as of his own knowledge,
or in such absolute unqualified and positive terms as to imply his personal
knowledge of the fact, when in truth defendant had no knowledge
whether the statement was true or false; or, third, that the
party’s special situation or means of knowledge were such as to make
it his duty to know as to the truth or falsity of the representation.
Under each phase the proof must show that the statement was in fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_583'>583</span>false, and in addition, under the first, that defendant had actual knowledge
that it was false; under the second, that defendant made the
statement as of his own knowledge, when in fact he had no knowledge
whether it was true or false, which seems to bear a close resemblance
to the English rule, “without belief in its truth, or recklessly careless
whether it be true or false”; and under the third, that defendant’s
special situation or means of knowledge were such as made it his
duty to know as to the truth or falsity of the representation. From
this statement it is quite evident that proof sufficient to sustain the
third phase tends very strongly to sustain the idea that the defendant
had actual knowledge of the falsity of his statement; for when it is
shown that the statement was material and false, and that the defendant’s
situation or means of knowledge were such as to make it incumbent
upon him as a matter of duty to know whether the statement was
true or false, the conclusion is almost irresistible that he did know
that which his duty required him to know. For this reason the law
conclusively presumes from the existence of these facts that defendant
had actual knowledge of the falsity of his statement, or, more properly
speaking, proof of these facts is sufficient to sustain a charge of actual
knowledge, dispensing with further proof upon that subject, and admitting
no proof to rebut the fact of actual knowledge, but only proof
to rebut the existence of the facts from which such actual knowledge
is inferred. We are therefore of opinion that proof of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i> in the
third phase does not give another or different right or ground of action
from that given by proof under the first phase, but that it simply
establishes the same ultimate fact, viz., knowledge, by a different
class of evidence, and consequently that an allegation that defendant
“knew” his representation to be false is provable by evidence embraced
in the third phase. In other words, an averment that defendant’s
situation or means of knowledge were such as made it his
duty to know whether his statement was true or false, and an averment
that defendant well knew his statements to be untrue, are but
different methods of stating the same ultimate fact, viz., knowledge.<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c015'><sup>[343]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Case for false warranty in the sale of a farm. Plea, not guilty.
Trial by jury, May term, 1868, Barrett, J., presiding.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff gave evidence tending to show that he bought the farm
at the time and for the price stated in the declaration, and that the
defendant made representations in respect to the number of acres, as
of his own knowledge, designedly intending to induce the plaintiff to
suppose and believe, and thereby the plaintiff was induced to and did
suppose and believe, that the farm contained at least one hundred and
thirty acres of land, and relying thereupon, the plaintiff made the purchase;
that the defendant knew that there was not one hundred and
thirty acres, or he didn’t know that there was that quantity; that in
fact there was only one hundred and seventeen acres and a few rods in
the farm; that the plaintiff had no knowledge of the quantity except
from the defendant’s representation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant gave evidence tending to show that he supposed
there was one hundred and thirty acres and a little more in the farm,
derived from what he had heard said, and from various deeds in his
possession of various grantors and of various parcels, but that he did
not know, and did not profess or represent to the plaintiff that he
knew how many acres there were in fact; that he gave the plaintiff
all the information and sources of information he had on the subject,
neither making any false representation, nor fraudulent concealment,
nor any undertaking as to the number of acres in the farm. There
was no evidence or claim that the farm was sold by the acre; but it
appeared that it was sold in lump, or as a farm entire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff requested the Court to charge the jury:—</p>

<p class='c007'><em>First</em>, That under the declaration the plaintiff is entitled to recover
if he proves a warranty of the number of acres in the farm, or if he
proves a fraudulent representation of the number of acres.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Second</em>, That the fraudulent representation may be proved either by
evidence of false representations, known to the defendant to be false,
and relied upon by the plaintiff, or by proof of an absolute representation
of the number of acres, which representation was made with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>intent that the plaintiff should rely upon it, and was made upon professed
knowledge, but without actual knowledge, and which was in
fact false, but was relied upon by the plaintiff as true.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court complied with said requests only so far as is shown by
the charge, and charged as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to entitle the plaintiff to recover he must satisfy the jury
that the defendant knew the farm did not contain one hundred and
thirty acres, or that he did not believe it contained one hundred and
thirty acres; and that in order to induce the plaintiff to buy the farm
he falsely represented it to contain one hundred and thirty acres; and
that the plaintiff was by such false representation induced to make the
purchase, believing it to contain that quantity.</p>

<p class='c007'>If he honestly believed it contained one hundred and thirty acres,
the plaintiff cannot recover, though the defendant was in error about
it. Honest mistake is not fraud. Incorrect is not the same as false.
You must find that he represented the quantity different from what he
knew or believed to be true, with the fraudulent intent. Also, that the
plaintiff was thus induced to make the purchase. That is, that the
plaintiff would not have made the purchase if the defendant had not
represented it to be one hundred and thirty acres. Inquire as to these
several points. Fraud is not presumed, but must be proved.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury returned a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff excepted
to the charge in the respects in which it failed to comply with,
or was against said requests. In other respects the charge was
satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The declaration counted both upon a false warranty of the defendant
in regard to the number of acres contained in the farm, and a
warranty in regard to said quantity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Steele, J.</span> 1. The plaintiff cannot recover upon the ground of a
parol warranty of the quantity of the land. If the quantity was warranted
it should be provable by the deed. It is true that a deed of
conveyance need not contain all the stipulations of the parties. For
example, the agreements as to consideration and mode of payment
need not be embraced in the deed, for the instrument purports to be
the deed of but one of the parties. But it does purport to contain the
convenants of the grantor with respect to the property conveyed. To
add a new covenant by parol proof would be a palpable violation of the
familiar rule that written contracts are not to be varied by oral testimony.
Such a parol stipulation, it has been held, could not be proved
in respect to an ordinary bill of sale of personal property.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor is the plaintiff entitled to recover in this action upon the ground
of mistake. A mutual and material mistake, by which the purchaser
was misled as to the quantity of land, would be a more appropriate
ground for relief in a court of chancery than in a court of law.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>If, then, the plaintiff was entitled to recover at all in this case, it
was by reason of some fraud on the part of the defendant by which
the bargain was induced.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The plaintiff complains of the ruling of the County Court upon
the subject of fraud. It is conceded that the quantity of land was represented
incorrectly. The Court properly told the jury that this, in
itself, would not amount to fraud. To entitle the plaintiff to a recovery
upon that ground, the defendant must have made some representation
upon the subject that he did not believe to be true. The
plaintiff claims, and his evidence tended to prove, that the defendant
did make such a representation by stating the quantity of land as a
matter within his own knowledge, when, in fact, as the defendant concedes,
it was a matter upon which he had only a belief. We think it
very clear that a party may be guilty of fraud by stating his belief
as knowledge. Upon a statement of the defendant’s mere belief,
judgment, or information, the plaintiff might have regarded it prudent
to procure a measurement of the land before completing his purchase.
A statement, as of knowledge, if believed, would make a survey or
measurement seem unnecessary. A representation of a fact, as of
the party’s own knowledge, if it prove false, is, unless explained, inferred
to be wilfully false and made with an intent to deceive, at
least in respect to the knowledge which is professed. A sufficient explanation
however sometimes arises from the nature of the subject
itself, or from the situation of the parties being such that the statement
of knowledge could only be understood as an expression of strong
belief or opinion. But the quantity of land in a farm is a matter upon
which accurate or approximately accurate knowledge is not at all impossible
or unusual. If the defendant had only a belief or opinion
as to the quantity of land, it was an imposition upon the plaintiff to
pass off such belief as knowledge. So, too, if he made an absolute
representation as to the quantity, which was understood and intended
to be understood as a statement upon knowledge, it is precisely the
same as if he had distinctly and in terms professed to have knowledge
as to the fact. It is often said that a representation is not fraudulent
if the party who makes it believes it to be true. But a party who is
aware that he has only an opinion how a fact is, and represents that
opinion as knowledge, does not believe his representation to be true.
As is well said in a note to the report of the case of Taylor <em>v.</em> Ashton,
11 Mees. &amp; Wels. 418 (Phila. Ed.), the belief of a party to be an
excuse for a false representation must be “a belief in the representation
as made. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</span></i> will therefore be sufficiently established by
showing that the assertion was made as of the defendant’s own knowledge,
and not as mere matter of opinion, with regard to facts of which
he was aware that he had no such knowledge.” The same principle
of law has been repeatedly recognized. Hammatt <em>v.</em> Emerson, 27
Maine, 308, 326; Bennett <em>v.</em> Judson, 21 N. Y. 238; Stone <em>v.</em> Denny,
4 Met. 151; Hazard <em>v.</em> Irwin, 18 Pick. 95.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_587'>587</span>In the case before us the plaintiff, under the charge of the Court,
was denied the benefit of this rule of law, although there was evidence
tending to show every necessary element of a fraud of the nature we
have been considering. The plaintiff’s request was refused, and the
jury were instructed that the plaintiff could only recover in case they
found “that the defendant represented the quantity of land different
from what he knew or believed to be true.” Under these instructions
it would be immaterial whether he made the representation as a matter
of knowledge or as a matter of opinion so long as he kept within his
belief as to the quantity of land. In this we think there was error.
The Court properly instructed the jury that the representation, to
warrant a recovery, must have been relied on and have been an inducement
to the purchase. The subsequent remark that the jury, to
hold the defendant, must find that the plaintiff would not have made
the purchase but for the representation, we regard as probably inadvertent.</p>

<p class='c007'>What the plaintiff would have done but for the false representation
is often a mere speculative inquiry, and is not the test of the plaintiff’s
right. If the false representations were material and relied upon, and
were intended to operate and did operate as one of the inducements to
the trade, it is not necessary to inquire whether the plaintiff would or
would not have made the purchase without this inducement.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Case for deceit; the declaration alleging that certain false representations
were made by the defendant to the plaintiffs, merchants in
London, in order to induce them to engage one Jacque as their agent
at Manchester.<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c015'><sup>[345]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Plea, the general issue.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial before Tindal, C. J., London sittings after Michaelmas
term, it appeared that in November or December, 1824, the defendant,
a soap manufacturer, called on the plaintiffs, wholesale tea dealers,
with whom he was on terms of intimacy, and after asking them if they
did business at Manchester, said “he had a young friend for whom he
was anxious to procure a commission in the tea trade at Manchester;
a nice young man, who had an excellent connection there, and would
be a great acquisition to any person who wanted to do business there;
the defendant being on such terms with the plaintiffs, he had offered
it to them before he proposed it to Smith and Co.,—a respectable
house in the same line of business; that Smith and Co. would jump at
the offer; that his friend was so excellent a young man, that he would
rather trust him without security than most men with; that this
young man had been doing business at Manchester for a London tea
house, who could no longer execute his extensive orders; that he had
an uncle at Manchester, a clergyman of the Scotch Church, who would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>afford him great facilities in the way of business, and knew all the
Scotch travellers in the trade; that defendant would like him to sell
soap for defendant and his partner, but feared his other connections
would not allow him time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiffs said they had an objection to giving commissions; but
the very strong recommendation defendant had given of his friend
would induce them to think of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly, in the beginning of 1825, the plaintiffs employed James
Jacque, the defendant’s young friend, to do business for them on commission
at Manchester. But by the middle of 1827, after repeatedly
sending incorrect statements of the amount of his receipts on their
behalf, he contrived to be a defaulter to them to the extent of £900
and upwards, and to involve them in bad debts to a much greater
amount.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then took the benefit of the insolvent debtors’ act.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of having been employed in the Manchester commission tea
trade in the year 1824, as the defendant had stated to the plaintiffs, it
appeared that he had, at the recommendation of the defendant, been
taken into partnership without any capital by Mr. R. C. Stewart, a
warehouseman in London, in July, 1823; but great losses having been
incurred in that concern, aggravated by a robbery to some amount,
Mr. Stewart closed the concern and dissolved the partnership in
October, 1824.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jacque was then indebted to Stewart in the sum of £800, which he
undertook by deed, dated November 13, 1824, to pay by instalments,
in two, three, and four years; but nothing was ever paid.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this was known to the defendant, who had acted throughout for
Jacque, and had negotiated the terms of the dissolution of partnership.</p>

<p class='c007'>Letters were also put in, written by the defendant to Jacque, after
the exposure of the Manchester transactions, in which the defendant
exhorted Jacque to write various falsehoods to the plaintiffs with a
view to the exculpation of the defendant, and to conceal from the
plaintiffs his knowledge of some of the transactions at Manchester.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the defendant was first applied to on the subject by the plaintiffs,
he expressed his regret that his house should have been the means
of introducing an unworthy agent to the plaintiffs; but that as they
had been instrumental in bringing the loss on the plaintiffs, he would
see his partner on the subject, and see what could be done towards
relieving them from it. No step of that kind having been taken, the
present action was commenced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tindal, C. J., told the jury to consider whether the representation
complained of by the plaintiffs had ever been made, and if made,
whether it was false within the knowledge of the defendant; for unless
it were false within his knowledge, the action did not lie.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, which was set aside
by the Court. [6 Bingham, 396.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>Upon a new trial, Tindal, C. J., told the jury that if the defendant
made representations concerning Jacque, the tendency of which was to
occasion loss to the plaintiff, knowing such representations to be false,
and intending thereby to benefit himself, he was guilty of fraud in the
common acceptation of the term; if he made such representations,
knowing them to be false, without proposing thereby any advantage to
himself, but proposing, perhaps, to benefit a third person, he was
guilty of fraud in the legal acceptation of the term, and responsible to
the plaintiff for any injury resulting from such representations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury thereupon found for the plaintiff, damages £800; but
added: “We consider there was no actual fraud on the part of
the defendant, and that he had no fraudulent intention, although
what he has done constituted a fraud in the legal acceptation of the
term.”</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Jones</em>, Serjt., now contended that this amounted to a verdict for the
defendant; and therefore moved that the verdict might be entered for
him, instead of the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>He urged, at some length, nearly the same arguments as he had
advanced on a former occasion, and adverted to the same authorities
(see 6 Bing. 402); contending that this action was substituted for the
ancient writ of deceit; that the gist of the action was a fraudulent
intent on the part of the defendant to injure the plaintiff by deceiving
him; that a defendant was not responsible for the consequences of a
statement, merely because he knew it to be false; he was not responsible
for the consequences of a bare lie; in order to render him responsible,
it ought to be shown that he intended to defraud the plaintiff
of something by the deceit he had practised. That if a party were
responsible for the consequences of a lie told without any intention
to defraud the hearer of something, no line could be drawn, and parties
might be called on to answer for those excusable untruths, which were
sometimes told for the purpose of avoiding a greater mischief.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tindal, C. J.</span> No sufficient ground has been laid to induce us to
disturb the verdict which has been found for the plaintiff. The application
arises on a misconception of what the jury have found. They
first deliver a verdict for the plaintiff, with damages, and then add,
that in point of fact they consider the defendant had no fraudulent
intention, although he had been guilty of fraud in the legal acceptation
of the term.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their attention had been drawn by me to two classes of motives
possible on the part of the defendant; first, a desire to benefit himself
by making a statement which he knew to be false; secondly, a desire
to benefit some third person; and I stated that, although there might
be no intention on his part to obtain an advantage for himself, it
would still be a fraud, for which he was responsible in law, if he made
representations productive of loss to another, knowing such representations
to be false.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_591'>591</span>The jury in finding that he had no intention to defraud mean only
that he was not actuated by the baser motive of obtaining an advantage
for himself, but that he was guilty of fraud in law by stating that
which he knew to be false, and which was the cause of loss to the
plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question, therefore, is, whether, if a party makes representations
which he knows to be false, and occasions injury thereby, he is
not liable for the consequences of his falsehood.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be most dangerous to hold that he is not.</p>

<p class='c007'>The confusion seems to have arisen from not distinguishing between
what is fraud in law and the motives for actual fraud. It is fraud in
law if a party makes representations which he knows to be false, and
injury ensues, although the motive from which the representations
proceeded may not have been bad; the person who makes such representations
is responsible for the consequences; and the verdict, therefore,
in this case ought not to be disturbed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Park, J.</span> I am of the same opinion. In what fell from this Court
in the case of Tapp <em>v.</em> Lee, and upon the former decision of the present
case, the doctrine has been laid down most accurately. It would be
unfair to take the expressions of the jury, without connecting them
with what the Chief Justice had just presented for their consideration.
It is clear that the jury meant to draw the distinction between the
sordid motive of personal advantage and the legal fraud which might
be committed by a representation false within the knowledge of the
speaker, although made without any view to his own advantage. For
such a representation the defendant is responsible if mischief ensues,
whatever may have been his motive; and as to its being necessary to
prove the motive by which he was actuated: when the case was last
before the Court, Tindal, C. J., said, “I am not aware of any authority
for such a position, nor that it can be material what the motive was;
the law will infer an improper motive, if what the defendant says is
false within his own knowledge, and is the occasion of damage to the
plaintiff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the defendant said “That his friend was so excellent a young
man, that he would rather trust him without security than most men
with;” when he knew the contrary to be the fact, he was guilty of
a fraud in law in making such a representation; and fraud in law is
sufficient to support this action.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Gaselee, J.</span> When this verdict is taken in connection with the direction
of the Chief Justice, there is an end to all doubt as to the
meaning of the jury, and the finding is a perfect finding. What the
jury meant by actual fraud was a sordid regard to self-interest; but
the legal fraud, which is sufficient to sustain the action, was complete
when the intention to mislead was followed by actual injury.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bosanquet, J.</span> There seems to me to be no reason for disturbing
this verdict. In the course of the trial, it is probable that improper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span>motives had been ascribed to the defendant. The Chief Justice, therefore,
stated to the jury, and stated correctly, that motives of that description
in the defendant were not essential to the plaintiff’s action.
If a person tells a falsehood, the natural and obvious consequence of
which, if acted on, is injury to another, that is fraud in law. Coupling
that with what the Chief Justice addressed to the jury, their verdict
only means that the defendant did not propose to benefit himself, perhaps
intended to benefit another; but that what he said, intending to
benefit another, was false within his own knowledge, injurious to the
party who received the communication, and, consequently, a fraud in
the legal acceptation of the term.</p>

of Hancorne, and did falsely and fraudulently pretend to accept the
same by the procuration of Hancorne. It then proceeded to allege
several indorsements of the bill, and that the plaintiff, relying on the
pretended acceptance, and believing that the defendant had authority
from Hancorne to accept, received the bill from the last indorsee in
discharge of a debt; that the bill was dishonored, and that the plaintiff
brought an unsuccessful action against Hancorne. The second
count contained a similar statement of the false representation by the
defendant, and that he accepted the bill in writing under pretence of
the procuration from Hancorne; and then proceeded to describe the
indorsements to the plaintiff, and the dishonor of the bill, and alleged,
that thereupon it became and was the duty of the defendant to pay the
bill as the acceptor thereof, but that he had not done so.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_593'>593</span>On the trial it appeared, that when the bill was presented for acceptance
by a person named Armfield, who was one of the payees of the
bill, Hancorne was absent; and that the defendant, who lived in the
same house with him, was induced to write on the bill an acceptance
as by the procuration of Hancorne, Armfield assuring him that the
bill was perfectly regular, and the defendant fully believing that
the acceptance would be sanctioned, and the bill paid at maturity, by
the drawee. It was afterwards passed into the plaintiff’s hands, and
being dishonored when due an action was brought against Hancorne;
the defendant was called as a witness on the trial of that action, and he
negativing any authority from Hancorne, the plaintiff was nonsuited.
I left to the jury the question of deceit and fraud in the defendant,
as a question of fact on the evidence, and the jury having negatived all
fraud, the defendant had a verdict, liberty being reserved to the plaintiff
to move to enter a verdict, if the Court should think the action
maintainable notwithstanding that finding.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the argument, two points were made by the plaintiff’s counsel.
It was contended, in the first place, that although the defendant was
not guilty of any fraud or deceit, he might be made liable as acceptor
of the bill; that the second count was applicable to that view of the
case; and that, after rejecting the allegations of fraud and falsehood
in that count, it contained a sufficient statement of a cause of action
against him, as acceptor. But we are clearly of opinion that the defendant
cannot be made responsible in that character. It is enough to
say that no one can be liable as acceptor but the person to whom the
bill is addressed, unless he be an acceptor for honor, which the
defendant certainly was not.</p>

<p class='c007'>This distinguishes the present case from that of a pretended agent
making a promissory note (referred to in Mr. Roscoe’s Digest of the
Law of Bills of Exchange, note 9, p. 47), or purchasing goods in the
name of a supposed principal. And, indeed, it may well be doubted if
the defendant, by writing this acceptance, entered into any contract or
warranty at all, that he had authority to do so; and if he did, it would
be an insuperable objection to an action as on a contract by this plaintiff,
that at all events there was no contract with, or warranty to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in the next place contended that the allegation of falsehood
and fraud in the first count was supported by the evidence; and that,
in order to maintain this species of action, it is not necessary to prove
that the false representation was made from a corrupt motive of gain
to the defendant, or a wicked motive of injury to the plaintiff; it was
said to be enough if a representation is made which the party making
it knows to be untrue, and which is intended by him, or which, from
the mode in which it is made, is calculated to induce another to act on
the faith of it, in such a way as that he may incur damage, and that
damage is actually incurred. A wilful falsehood of such a nature was
contended to be, in the legal sense of the word, a fraud; and for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>position was cited the case of Foster <em>v.</em> Charles, 6 Bing. 396; 7 Bing.
105, which was twice under the consideration of the Court of Common
Pleas, and to which may be added the recent case of Corbet <em>v.</em> Brown,
8 Bing. 33. The principle of these cases appears to us to be well
founded, and to apply to the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that there the representation was made immediately to the
plaintiff, and was intended by the defendant to induce the plaintiff to
do the act which caused him damage. Here, the representation is made
to all to whom the bill may be offered in the course of circulation, and
is, in fact, intended to be made to all, and the plaintiff is one of those;
and the defendant must be taken to have intended, that all such persons
should give credit to the acceptance, and thereby act upon the
faith of that representation, because that, in the ordinary course of
business, is its natural and necessary result.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, then, the defendant, when he wrote the acceptance, and thereby,
in substance, represented that he had authority from the drawee to
make it, knew that he had no such authority (and upon the evidence
there can be no doubt that he did), the representation was untrue to
his knowledge, and we think that an action will lie against him by the
plaintiff for the damage sustained in consequence.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the defendant had had good reason to believe his representation
to be true, as, for instance, if he had acted upon a power of attorney
which he supposed to be genuine, but which was, in fact, a forgery, he
would have incurred no liability, for he would have made no statement
which he knew to be false: a case very different from the present, in
which it is clear that he stated what he knew to be untrue, though with
no corrupt motive.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is of the greatest importance in all transactions that the truth
should be strictly adhered to. In the present case, the defendant no
doubt believed that the acceptance would be ratified, and the bill paid
when due, and if he had done no more than to make a statement of
that belief, according to the strict truth, by a memorandum appended
to the bill, he would have been blameless. But then the bill would
never have circulated as an accepted bill, and it was only in consequence
of the false statement of the defendant that he actually had
authority to accept, that the bill gained its credit, and the plaintiff
sustained a loss. For these reasons we are of opinion that the rule
should be made absolute to enter a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c014'>Case for deceitful representations by a debtor to his creditor, the
plaintiff having subsequently purchased the claim from the latter in
the form of a promissory note. Heard on defendant’s petition for
new trial.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Per Curiam.</span> Assuming that the representations testified to by the
plaintiff were made by the defendant, the testimony shows that they
were made for the purpose of being communicated to Murphy, to procure
an extension of time for the payment of his claim against the
defendant. At the time they were made the defendant had no expectation
that the note, which was subsequently made, was to be taken
by the plaintiff, who, in the meantime, had purchased the claim from
Murphy. We do not think that in these circumstances the plaintiff
had the right to rely on the representations, if they were made, because
they were not made with the intention of inducing his action,
and consequently that he has no ground to maintain an action for
deceit.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span><span class='sc'>Collins, J.</span>...</p>

<p class='c007'>2. At defendants’ request the court charged the jury, in substance,
that they must find for defendants, unless it appeared by a preponderance
of testimony that the property conveyed by plaintiff in exchange
for the shares of stock was worth more than the latter; and
to this plaintiff excepted, on the ground that it prevented the jury
from returning a verdict in his favor for nominal damages; that, even
if the jury should fail to find that the property conveyed by plaintiff
was of greater value than the shares of stock transferred to him,—passing
on all other questions in his favor,—they might award him
nominal damages at least; and that the possibility of such an award
was excluded by the charge. But, at plaintiff’s request, the jury was
instructed that, if they found for him, the amount he would be entitled
to recover would be the amount of the difference between the actual
value of the property which he conveyed and the actual value of the
stock received by him. The rule as to the measure of damages in the
case was stated in better form in plaintiff’s than in defendants’ request,
but one was, in effect, a repetition of the other. The rule was correctly
stated in each, and the same proposition of law was elsewhere in the
charge laid down by the court in very concise and proper, but different,
language. The essential elements which constitute a cause of action
for deceit are well stated in Busterud <em>v.</em> Farrington, 36 Minn. 320 (31
N. W. Rep. 360), and one is that the party induced to act has been
damaged. He must have acted on the faith of the false representations
<em>to his damage</em>. A party cannot sustain an action of this character where
no harm has come to him. Deceit and injury must concur,—Doran
<em>v.</em> Eaton, 40 Minn. 35 (41 N. W. Rep. 244);—or, as it has frequently
been put by the courts, fraud without damage or damage without
fraud will not sustain the action for deceit. Taylor <em>v.</em> Guest, 58 N. Y.
262; Nye <em>v.</em> Merriam, 35 Vt. 438; Freeman <em>v.</em> McDaniel, 23 Ga. 354;
Byard <em>v.</em> Holmes, 34 N. J. Law, 296; 3 Suth. Dam. 594; Cooley,
Torts, 474; Bailey, Onus Probandi, 770. If, therefore, the shares of
stock were worth what plaintiff gave for them, were of equal value
with the property exchanged, the plaintiff was not damaged, and was
not entitled to recover; for the proper measure of damages was the
difference in value between the shares of stock and the property conveyed
by plaintiff for them. Redding <em>v.</em> Godwin, 44 Minn. 355 (46
N. W. Rep. 563), and cases cited. The plaintiff, under such a rule,
would not be permitted to recover nominal damages even without
proof of loss or injury, and there is nothing said in Potter <em>v.</em> Mellen,
36 Minn. 122 (30 N. W. Rep. 438), as counsel has contended, indicating
a contrary view. Damage is of the essence of the action of deceit;
an essential element to the right of action, and not merely a consequence
flowing from it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>Action of tort. Writ dated Dec. 22, 1873. Plaintiff held the negotiable
promissory note of J. W. and J. H. Cox, dated July 16, 1873, payable to plaintiff
or order in two years from date; and he also held a mortgage conditioned
to secure the note. In consideration of land to be conveyed to him by the
defendant, plaintiff agreed to assign to defendant the mortgage and note; but
he did not agree to make an unrestricted indorsement of the note, and the defendant
was not entitled to have the personal liability of the plaintiff as indorser
of the note. Plaintiff, through ignorance of the law, and by reason of
the false and fraudulent representations of defendant, on Dec. 1, 1873, indorsed
the note in blank without any qualification. As soon as the plaintiff
became aware of the obligation he had thus assumed, and before defendant
had negotiated the note or altered his position in any way, plaintiff demanded
to be allowed to qualify his indorsement so that it should merely transfer the
title according to the agreement. Defendant refused to allow this. Thereupon
plaintiff forbade defendant to negotiate the note; but defendant, notwithstanding,
negotiated the note before maturity to one Tenney, a <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>
holder for value.</p>

<p class='c019'>Upon a trial by a judge, without a jury, the foregoing facts were found, substantially
as alleged in the declaration.</p>

<p class='c019'>It also appeared, that, before commencing his action, or at any time before
said trial, the plaintiff had made no payment on account or by reason of the
indorsement; that, before the commencement of this action and before the
maturity of the note, the makers thereof had become bankrupts; that since
the commencement a semi-annual instalment of interest had become due;
that Tenney had caused the real estate to be sold by virtue of the power contained
in the mortgage, had applied a part of the proceeds of the sale in liquidation
of that interest, and, since the maturity of the note, had applied the
balance of the proceeds in part payment of the note, and had commenced an
action against the plaintiff to recover the balance of said note (due demand
having been made and notice given), which action is now pending.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>Defendant requested the judge to rule that, upon the foregoing facts the
plaintiff could not maintain his action, but, if he could, that he was entitled
to recover only nominal damages. The judge declined so to rule, and held
that defendant was liable for the conversion of the note, and that the measure
of the plaintiff’s damages was the amount which the plaintiff was legally compellable
to pay to the holder of the note, namely, the face of the note and interest,
less the amount realized from the sale under the mortgage, treating the
same as a partial payment. Defendant excepted.<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c015'><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Colt, J.</span> [After deciding that there was no conversion of the note.] The
further objection is, that treating this as an action to recover damages for an
alleged fraud, the plaintiff shows no damages sustained at the time his action
was commenced. It was then uncertain and contingent whether he would
ever be called on to pay the note. It was payable to the plaintiff or order in
two years, and was dated in July, 1873, shortly before its transfer by his indorsement
to the defendant. The liability of the plaintiff depended on the
failure of the makers to pay and the giving of due notice to him as indorser.
No payment has in fact ever been made by him. If the holder receives his pay
from the makers through the mortgage security or otherwise, the plaintiff will
have suffered no actionable wrong. There will have been no concurrence of
damage with fraud, within the rule on which such actions are founded. And
as there has been no invasion of the plaintiff’s rights, no breach of promise,
and no interference with his property, there can be no recovery of even nominal
damages in this action. Pasley <em>v.</em> Freeman, 3 T. R. 51; 2 Smith Lead.

<p class='c022'>[Plaintiffs, by fraudulent representations of defendants, were induced to
execute promissory notes to defendants. Upon a proceeding to cancel and
annul the notes, it appeared that the notes had been transferred to, and were
then held by, <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> purchasers for value; and hence could not be decreed
to be cancelled. It was <em>held</em>, that the court having jurisdiction of the
defendants personally, had power to render judgment for damages. The

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Siebecker, J.</span> It is urged that compensatory damages cannot be awarded
because they are not ascertainable under the facts found, and that plaintiffs
must wait until they have made actual payment of the notes. This contention
cannot be sustained. The court properly held that these notes in the hands of
<i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> purchasers for value established a liability according to their terms
against these plaintiffs, and that such liability was measured by the amount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>they call for on their face with interest. We deem this the correct measure
of damages in the case, and within the principle of the case of Lyle <em>v.</em> McCormick

<p class='c022'>Tort for deceit, alleging that, relying upon the false and fraudulent representations
of the defendant, a broker, that certain sales of the stock of the
Franklin Park Land Improvement Company in the Boston Stock Exchange
from January 1, to March 27, 1893, were genuine transactions, the plaintiff revoked
an order for the sale of certain shares of that stock held for him by the
defendant, whereby the plaintiff suffered loss. Writ dated February 17,
1896.<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c015'><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>At the trial in the Superior Court, Hopkins, J., at the close of the evidence,
directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant. The verdict was returned
as directed; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions. The findings warranted
by the evidence are stated in the opinion of the court.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Hammond, J.</span> The parties to this action testified in flat contradiction of
each other on many of the material issues, but the evidence in behalf of the
plaintiff would warrant a finding by the jury, that on March 25, 1893, the
plaintiff, being then the owner of certain shares of stock in the Franklin Park
Land and Improvement Company, gave an order to the defendant, a broker
who was carrying the stock for him on a margin, to sell it at a price not less
than $28.50 per share; that on March 27 the defendant, for the purpose of
inducing the plaintiff to withdraw the order and refrain from selling, represented
to the plaintiff that the sales which had been made of said stock in the
market had all been made in good faith and had been “actual true sales
throughout”; that these statements were made as of the personal knowledge
of the defendant, and that the plaintiff, believing them to be true and relying
upon them, was thereby induced to and did cancel his oral order to the defendant
to sell, and did refrain from selling; and that the statements were not true,
as to some of the sales in the open market, of which the last was in December,
1892, and that the defendant knew it at the time he made the representations.
The evidence would warrant a further finding that in continuous reliance upon
such representations the plaintiff kept his stock, when he otherwise would
have sold it, until the following July, when its market value depreciated, and
he thereby suffered loss. The defendant, protesting that he made no such
representation and that the jury would not be justified in finding that he had,
says that even upon such a finding the plaintiff would have no case. He contends
that the representation was not material, that a false representation to
be material must not only induce action but must be adequate to induce it by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_600'>600</span>offering a motive sufficient to influence the conduct of a man of average intelligence
and prudence, and that in this case the representation complained of, so
far as it was false, was not adequate to induce action because the fictitious
sales were so few and distant in time, and that therefore it was not material.</p>

<p class='c019'>It may be assumed that the plaintiff desired to handle his stock in the
manner most advantageous to himself, and that the question whether he
would withdraw his order to sell was dependent, somewhat, at least, upon his
view of the present or future market value of the stock; and upon that question
a man of ordinary intelligence and prudence would consider whether the
reported sales in the market were “true sales throughout” or were fictitious,
and what was the extent of each. It is true that a corporation may be of so
long standing and of such a nature, and the number of the shares so great and
the daily sales of the stock in the open market so many and heavy, that the
knowledge that a certain percentage of the sales reported are not actual business
transactions would have no effect upon the conduct of an ordinary man.
On the other hand a corporation may be so small and of such a nature and
have so slight a hold upon the public, and the number of its shares may be so
small and the buyers so few, that the question whether certain reported sales
are fictitious may have a very important bearing upon the action of such a
man. Upon the evidence in this case, we cannot say, as matter of law, that
the representation so far as false was not material. This question is for the
jury, who are to consider it in the light of the nature of the corporation and its
standing in the market, and of other matters, including such as those of which
we have spoken.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is further urged by the defendant that one of the fundamental principles
in a suit like this is that the representation should have been acted upon by
the complaining party and to his injury; that at most the plaintiff simply
refrained from action, and that “refraining from action is not acting upon
representation” within the meaning of the rule; and further that it is not
shown that the damages, if any, suffered by the plaintiff are the direct result
of the deceit.</p>

<p class='c019'>Fraud is sometimes defined as the “deception practised in order to induce
another to part with property or to surrender some legal right,” Cooley,
Torts (2d ed.), 555, and sometimes as the deception which leads “a man into
damage by wilfully or recklessly causing him to believe and act on a falsehood.”
Pollock, Torts (Webb’s ed.), 348, 349. The second definition seems
to be more comprehensive than the first (see for instance Barley <em>v.</em> Walford,
9 Q. B. 197, and Butler <em>v.</em> Watkins, 13 Wall. 456), and while the authorities
establishing what is a cause of action for deceit are to a large extent convertible
with those which define the right to rescind a contract for fraud or misrepresentation
and the two classes of cases are generally cited without any
express discrimination, still discrimination is sometimes needful in the comparison
of the two classes of cases. Pollock, Torts (Webb’s ed.), 352.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is true that it must appear that the fraud should have been acted upon.
It is a little difficult to see precisely what is meant by the contention that
“refraining from action is not acting upon representation.” If by refraining
from action it is meant simply that the person defrauded makes no change
but goes on as he has been going and would go whether the fraud had been
committed or not, then the proposition is doubtless true. Such a person has
been in no way influenced, nor has his conduct been in any way changed by
the fraud. He has not acted in reliance upon it. If, however, it is meant to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_601'>601</span>include the case where the person defrauded does not do what he had intended
and started to do and would have done save for the fraud practised upon him,
the proposition cannot be true. So far as respects the owner of property, his
change of conduct between keeping the property on the one hand and selling it
on the other, is equally great, whether the first intended action be to keep or
to sell; and if by reason of fraud practised upon him the plaintiff was induced
to recall his order to sell, and, being continuously under the influence of
this fraud, kept his stock when, save for such fraud, he would have sold it,
then with reference to this property he acted upon the representation within
the meaning of the rule as applicable to cases like this. Barley <em>v.</em> Walford,
9 Q. B. 197; Butler <em>v.</em> Watkins, 13 Wall. 456.</p>

<p class='c019'>The cases of Lamb <em>v.</em> Stone, 11 Pick. 527; Wellington <em>v.</em> Small, 3 Cush. 145;
and Bradley <em>v.</em> Fuller, 118 Mass. 239, upon which the defendant relies, are not
authorities for the proposition that “refraining from action is not acting upon
representation.”</p>

<p class='c019'>As to whether the loss suffered by the plaintiff is legally attributable to the
fraud, much can be said in favor of the defendant, and a verdict in his favor
on this as well as on other material points might be the one most reasonably
to be expected upon the evidence, especially when it is considered that during
the years 1892 and 1893 the plaintiff was a director in the company; but we
cannot decide the question as a matter of law. If the fraud operated on the
plaintiff’s mind continuously, up to the time of the depreciation of the stock in
June, 1893, so that he kept his stock when otherwise he would have sold it,
and such was the direct, natural and intended result, then we think the causal
relation between the fraud and the loss is sufficiently made out. See Reeve <em>v.</em>
Dennett, 145 Mass. 23, 29.</p>

<p class='c022'>Tort for deceit, alleging, that, relying upon the false and fraudulent representations
of the defendant, a broker, that certain sales of the stock of the
Franklin Park Land Improvement Company in the Boston Stock Exchange
from January 1 to March 27, 1893, were genuine transactions, the plaintiff revoked
an order for the sale of certain shares of that stock held for him by the
defendant, whereby the plaintiff suffered loss. Writ dated February 17, 1896.</p>

<p class='c019'>At the first trial of the case in the Superior Court a verdict was ordered for
the defendant, and the exceptions of the plaintiff were sustained by this court
in a decision reported in 179 Mass. 295. At the new trial in the Superior
Court before Sherman, J., it appeared that one Moody Merrill, a director and
officer of the Franklin Park Land Improvement Company, absconded late in
May or early in June of 1893, and that immediately upon his departure it was
discovered that he had embezzled nearly $100,000 of the funds of that company,
the result of which was that the market price of the stock immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span>fell and the stock could not be sold; that the plaintiff from the time of the
discovery of the defendant’s alleged fraud did his best to sell his stock, but
was unable to do so at more than $3 a share, at which price he sold it after
bringing this action.</p>

<p class='c019'>The plaintiff among other requests asked the judge to rule, “That it is of
no consequence so far as the defendant’s liability is concerned that an outside
intervening cause has been the sole or contributing cause of the decline in
price to which the plaintiff’s loss is due.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The judge refused this and other rulings requested by the plaintiff, and
instructed the jury, among other things, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“If you find the fair market value of that stock was always above what
it was fictitiously quoted, or equal to it, and that it was so on the 25th of
March, 1893, and remained so and would have remained so, except for the
embezzlement and absconding of Moody Merrill, then the plaintiff is not entitled
to recover.</p>

<p class='c019'>“If you find that Moody Merrill’s going away did destroy the value of the
stock, practically destroy its value, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover
anything.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You may take all the evidence on this subject, the fact of what Moody
Merrill did, and what effect it had upon the market value of this stock, and
if that destroyed the market value, then, as I have told you, the plaintiff is
not entitled to recover anything. If his going away and embezzlement did not
affect the market value of this stock, then the plaintiff may recover the full
value of it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The judge submitted to the jury the following questions, which the jury
answered as stated below:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“1. Did the defendant make a representation to the plaintiff on or about
March 25, 1893, that the quotations in the Boston Stock Exchange of Franklin
Park Land and Improvement Company stock were quotations of actual
and true sales?” The jury answered “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“2. Were such quotations at or about the same sum as the quotations of
actual sales and the sales at public auction?” The jury answered “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“3. What was the fair market value of said stock on or about March 25,
1893?” The jury answered “$28.50 per share.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“4. What was the fair market value of said stock on the last day of May,
or immediately prior to June, 1893, the day before Moody Merrill’s absconding?”
The jury answered “$27.75 per share.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged
exceptions.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Knowlton, C. J.</span> The parties and the court seem to have assumed that the
evidence was such as to warrant a verdict for the plaintiff under the law stated
at the previous decision in this case, reported in 179 Mass. 295, if the diminution
in the selling price of the stock came from common causes. The defendant’s
contention is that the embezzlement of an officer of a corporation, being
an unlawful act of a third person, should be treated as a new and independent
cause of the loss, not contemplated by the defendant, for which he is not
liable.</p>

<p class='c019'>To create a liability, it never is necessary that a wrong-doer should contemplate
the particulars of the injury from his wrongful act, nor the precise way
in which the damages will be inflicted. He need not even expect that damage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_603'>603</span>will result at all, if he does that which is unlawful and which involves a risk
of injury. An embezzler is criminally liable, notwithstanding that he expects
to return the money appropriated after having used it. If the defendant
fraudulently induced the plaintiff to refrain from selling his stock when he
was about to sell it, he did him a wrong, and a natural consequence of the
wrong for which he was liable was the possibility of loss from diminution in
the value of the stock, from any one of numerous causes. Most, if not all, of
the causes which would be likely to affect the value of the stock, would be acts
of third persons, or at least conditions for which neither the plaintiff nor the
defendant would be primarily responsible. Acts of the officers, honest or dishonest,
in the management of the corporation, would be among the most common
causes of a change in value. The defendant, if he fraudulently induced
the plaintiff to keep his stock, took the risk of all such changes. The loss to
the plaintiff from the fraud is as direct and proximate, if he was induced to
hold his stock until an embezzlement was discovered, as if the value had been
diminished by a fire which destroyed a large part of the property of the corporation,
or by the unexpected bankruptcy of a debtor who owed the corporation
a large sum. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant would be presumed
to have contemplated all the particulars of the risk of diminution in value for
which the defendant made himself liable by his fraudulent representations. It
would be unjust to the plaintiff in such a case, and impracticable, to enter
upon an inquiry as to the cause of the fall in value, if the plaintiff suffered
from the fall wholly by reason of the defendant’s fraud. The risk of a fall,
from whatever cause, is presumed to have been contemplated by the defendant
when he falsely and fraudulently induced the plaintiff to retain his
stock.</p>

<p class='c019'>We do not intimate that these circumstances, as well as others, may not
properly be considered in determining whether the plaintiff was acting under
the inducement of the fraudulent representations in continuing to hold the
stock up to the time of the discovery of the embezzlement. The false representations
may or may not have ceased to operate as an inducement as to the
disposition of his stock before that time. Of course there can be no recovery,
except for the direct results of the fraud. But if the case is so far established
that the plaintiff, immediately upon the discovery of the embezzlement, was
entitled to recover on the ground that he was then holding the stock in reliance
upon the fraudulent statements, and if the great diminution in value
came while he was holding it, the fact that this diminution was brought about
by the embezzlement of an officer leaves the plaintiff’s right no less than if it
had come from an ordinary loss.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>Tort for deceit in making false and fraudulent representations to the plaintiff
touching the business and profits of a firm of which the defendant was a
member, and thereby inducing the plaintiff to buy the interest of the defendant
in the stock and good will of the firm. A count in contract for the same
cause of action was joined. Answer, a general denial and a plea of a discharge
in bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c019'>At the trial in the Superior Court, Brigham, C. J., ruled that the discharge
in bankruptcy was a defence to the second count, but not to the first count;
and the plaintiff relied on the first count only.</p>

<p class='c019'>The judge instructed the jury that “the measure of damages would be the
difference between the actual value of the stock and good will purchased at the
time of the purchase and the value of the same had the representation been
true.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged
exceptions.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Gray, J.</span> The objections that either the joinder of a count in contract with
the count in tort, or the certificate of discharge in bankruptcy, would defeat
the plaintiff’s right of action in tort for the defendant’s false and fraudulent
representations, were hardly relied on at the argument, and are groundless.
Gen. Sts. c. 129, § 2, cl. 5. Crafts <em>v.</em> Belden, 99 Mass. 535. U. S. St. 1867,
c. 176, § 33.</p>

<p class='c019'>The rule of damages was rightly stated to the jury. It is now well settled
that, in actions for deceit or breach of warranty, the measure of damages is
the difference between the actual value of the property at the time of the purchase
and its value if the property had been what it was represented or warranted
to be. Stiles <em>v.</em> White, 11 Met. 356; Tuttle <em>v.</em> Brown, 4 Gray, 457;
Whitemore <em>v.</em> South Boston Iron Co., 2 Allen, 52; Fisk <em>v.</em> Hicks, 11 Foster,
535; Woodward <em>v.</em> Thacher, 21 Verm. 580; Muller <em>v.</em> Eno, 4 Kernan, 597;
Sherwood <em>v.</em> Sutton, 5 Mason, 1; Loder <em>v.</em> Kekulé, 3 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 128; Dingle
<em>v.</em> Hare, 7 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 145; Jones <em>v.</em> Just, Law Rep. 3 Q. B. 197. This is the
only rule which will give the purchaser adequate damages for not having the
thing which the defendant undertook to sell him. To allow to the plaintiff (as
the learned counsel for the defendant argued in this case) only the difference
between the real value of the property and the price which he was induced to
pay for it would be to make any advantage lawfully secured to the innocent
purchaser in the original bargain inure to the benefit of the wrong-doer; and,
in proportion as the original price was low, would afford a protection to the
party who had broken, at the expense of the party who was ready to abide by,
the terms of the contract. The fact that the property sold was of such a
character as to make it difficult to ascertain with exactness what its value
would have been if it had conformed to the contract affords no reason for exempting
the defendant from any part of the direct consequences of his fraud.
And the value may be estimated as easily in this action as in an action against
him for an entire refusal to perform his contract.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>Error to the United States Circuit Court for the Northern District of
Ohio.</p>

<p class='c019'>Action to recover damages for fraudulent representations in the sale of
shares of mining stock.</p>

<p class='c019'>The amended petition alleged (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>) that plaintiff was induced by
defendant’s fraudulent representations to buy of defendant four thousand
shares of mining stock at $1.50 per share, amounting to $6000; that “said
stock and mining property was then, and still is, wholly worthless; and that
had the same been as represented by defendant it would have been worth at
least ten dollars per share; and so plaintiff says that by reason of the premises
he has sustained damages to the amount of forty thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Answer, denying plaintiff’s material allegations. Trial by jury. The instructions
given as to damages are stated in the opinion. Verdict for plaintiff.
Motion for new trial overruled. Judgment for plaintiff. Defendant brought
error.<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c015'><sup>[359]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Fuller, C. J.</span> The bill of exceptions states that the court charged the jury
“as to the law by which the jury were to be governed in the assessment of
damages under the issues made in the case,” that “the measure of recovery is
generally the difference between the contract price and the reasonable market
value, if the property had been as represented to be, or in case the property or
stock is entirely worthless, then its value is what it would have been worth
if it had been as represented by the defendant, and as may be shown in the
evidence before you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>In this there was error. The measure of damages was not the difference between
the contract price and the reasonable market value if the property had
been as represented to be, even if the stock had been worth the price paid for
it; nor if the stock were worthless, could the plaintiff have recovered the value
it would have had if the property had been equal to the representations. What
the plaintiff might have gained is not the question, but what he had lost by
being deceived into the purchase. The suit was not brought for breach of contract.
The gist of the action was that the plaintiff was fraudulently induced
by the defendant to purchase stock upon the faith of certain false and fraudulent
representations, and so as to the other persons on whose claims the
plaintiff sought to recover. If the jury believed from the evidence that the
defendant was guilty of the fraudulent and false representations alleged, and
that the purchase of stock had been made in reliance thereon, then the defendant
was liable to respond in such damages as naturally and proximately
resulted from the fraud. He was bound to make good the loss sustained, such
as the moneys the plaintiff had paid out and interest, and any other outlay
legitimately attributable to defendant’s fraudulent conduct; but this liability
did not include the expected fruits of an unrealized speculation. The reasonable
market value, if the property had been as represented, afforded, therefore,
no proper element of recovery.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>Nor had the contract price the bearing given to it by the court. What the
plaintiff paid for the stock was properly put in evidence, not as the basis of
the application of the rule in relation to the difference between the contract
price and the market or actual value, but as establishing the loss he had sustained
in that particular. If the stock had a value in fact, that would necessarily
be applied in reduction of the damages. “The damage to be recovered
must always be the <em>natural and proximate consequence</em> of the act complained
of,” says Mr. Greenleaf, vol. ii, § 256; and “the test is,” adds Chief Justice
Beasley in Crater <em>v.</em> Binninger, 33 N. J. Law (4 Vroom), 513, 518, “that those
results are proximate which the wrong-doer from his position must have contemplated
as the probable consequence of his fraud or breach of contract.” In
that case, the plaintiff had been induced by the deceit of the defendant to enter
into an oil speculation, and the defendant was held responsible for the moneys
put into the scheme by the plaintiff in the ordinary course of the business,
which moneys were lost, less the value of the interest which the plaintiff
retained in the property held by those associated in the speculation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Action for deceit, brought by Riddle against Schwabacker <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et als.</span></i>,
alleging that, in the purchase of property to be taken at the invoice
price, Riddle was cheated out of the sum of $2677.09 by fraudulent
representations made by defendants in regard to the amount the goods
purchased inventoried. On trial there was a verdict for plaintiff.
Some of the instructions are stated in the opinion. Judgment in favor
of Riddle. Schwabacker <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et als.</span></i> appealed.<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c015'><sup>[361]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Craig, C. J.</span>... Instruction No. 2 reads as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“If a party misrepresents a fact within his own knowledge, to the
injury of a third party, an action will lie for damages, if any, for such
misrepresentation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This instruction is liable to several serious objections. In the first
place, a misrepresentation, to be actionable, must be a material one,
or no action will lie. In the second place, in an action for deceit no
recovery can be had unless the plaintiff himself exercised ordinary
prudence to guard against the deception and fraud practised upon
him, unless he has been thrown off his guard by the other party.
These two principles were entirely ignored by the instruction, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_607'>607</span>jury, under this direction of the court, was at liberty to find against
the defendants if they misrepresented any immaterial fact, however
remote, and the plaintiff exercised no precaution whatever to guard
against imposition. This is not a sound rule to be adopted, and as the
instruction was calculated to mislead the jury, it ought not to have
been given.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>Instruction No. 13, given for the plaintiff, reads as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not necessary, in this case, that the plaintiff should show any
prior conspiracy or combination between the defendants to defraud
the plaintiff; it is enough if the evidence shows that a sale was made
to Riddle, or Riddle and Fosbender, and that the agreed price was for
the value of the property, as shown by a certain invoice, and that
notes were to be taken for the amount, and that the defendants had
notes drawn for $2677.09 more than the value of the property as
shown by such invoice; and if the plaintiff, before signing the notes,
asked if they were for the amount of the invoice, and Fosbender said
they were, in the presence and hearing of the other defendants, and if
Riddle relied upon such statement in signing the notes, which was
known to the defendants, then such conduct and representations
would amount to a fraud in the other defendants, if they resulted in
damages to the plaintiff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>[After stating an objection to this instruction.]</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, under this instruction a recovery may be had although the
plaintiff was deceived from a total want of reasonable care on his part.
At the time the notes were signed, as we understand the evidence of
plaintiff himself, the invoice, which showed the correct amount of the
goods, was present, and in the hands of one of the defendants. If
that be true, and it could have been obtained and inspected by the
plaintiff, and he failed and neglected to do so, but relied upon a statement
made by Fosbender at the time, it was for the jury to determine
whether, under the evidence, he had exercised proper diligence to
guard against deception, and if he did not, he could not recover. But
this principle was ignored in this and other instructions given for the
plaintiff. Indeed, this principle is not stated, but seems to be ignored
in all of the instructions given for the plaintiff. This last instruction,
in our judgment, was calculated to mislead the jury.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Corliss, J.</span><a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c015'><sup>[363]</sup></a> The plaintiff has recovered judgment for the balance
of the purchase price of a gas and electric plant located in the City
of Fargo, N. D., sold by plaintiff to the defendant. A portion of the
consideration was paid, and, upon being sued for the unpaid portion
of the purchase price, defendant set up as a defence a partial failure
of consideration from the non-delivery of some of the property purchased,
and also a counterclaim for damages arising out of the alleged
deceit of the plaintiff in making the sale. The view we take of the
case renders a more particular reference to the defence of partial failure
of consideration unnecessary. We will confine ourselves to the
single question of fraud. The property purchased consisted of a gas
plant, with mains and all the other classes of property which go to
make up such a plant, and also an arc electric light plant, with poles,
wires, and other fixtures distributed over different parts of the City
of Fargo. These two plants were used by the plaintiff at the time of
making the sale thereof to defendant, to light the public streets of
the City of Fargo, its public buildings, stores, hotels, and dwelling
houses, and had been so used for some time prior to such sale. The
alleged fraudulent representations were of two classes,—one class relating
to the physical condition of the plant, embracing statements as
to the number of miles of wire, the number of poles, the gas mains,
and as to the condition of the plant in other respects; and the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span>class related to the net earnings of the plant for the previous year,
and the prices charged customers for gas and electric light. It appears
that defendant relied chiefly upon the earning capacity of the
plant in making the purchase, and was induced to believe that its net
annual earnings would equal 10 per cent of the purchase price ($85,300),
because of the statements of the plaintiff’s officers that its net
earnings during the past year had been $8913. There was evidence
tending to show that this statement was false, and that it must have
been known to be false by plaintiff’s officers who negotiated the sale.
Having in this brief manner set forth the general character of the property
sold, and the general nature of the fraudulent representations
upon which defendant’s counterclaim for deceit was founded, we can
now intelligently turn to what we regard as a fatal error in the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of his charge to the jury, the learned trial judge instructed
them as follows: “If the means were at the defendant’s
hands to discover the truth or untruth of the plaintiff’s statements
with regard to the amount and character of the property, defendant
must be presumed to have had a knowledge of the actual facts.” This
instruction must be considered in the light of the refusal of the court
to charge the jury as follows, at the request of defendant’s counsel:
“If you find that, during the negotiations, statements were made by
the plaintiff as to the earnings of the plant, the defendant had a right
to rely upon these statements; and if they were so relied on, and
were false, and the defendant suffered injury thereby, the defendant
would be entitled to recover the damages which it suffered in consequence
thereof.” It is apparent from this refusal to charge, and from
the charge as cited given, that the court told the jury that, as a matter
of law, defendant did not have the right implicitly to rely upon
the representations of the plaintiff touching the character of the plant,
but must make inquiries concerning them, and must make investigation
as to their truth or falsity. It is true that the word “investigate”
is not used; but, when we consider the nature of the property
and the character of the representations made, it is obvious that
something more than a mere inspection of an object present before
a purchaser was necessary in order to enable the purchaser in this case
to “discover” the truth or falsity of plaintiff’s statements. Such an
instruction to a jury might be appropriate in an action in which fraud
in the sale of a horse was set up, the seller having represented the
horse to be perfectly sound, and it appearing that the horse stood before
the purchaser at the time the representation was made, and that
the only defect consisted in the absence of a leg, easily discernible by
the ordinary use of eyesight. But in the case at bar the means of discovering
the truth or untruth of these false statements were not at
hand in the sense that they must have been employed before the seller
could be held responsible for his fraudulent representations; and,
when this language was used, the jury must have drawn the inference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span>from the fact that this plant was in the same city, and could be investigated
with respect to its condition and its earnings, and the prices
charged customers for gas and electric light, and with reference to the
other features embraced in the statements made by plaintiff on the
sale, that therefore the means were at hand, within the rule laid down
by the court requiring the purchaser to discover at its peril the truth
or falsity of the statements made. Such a rule of law would be unjust
and intolerable. When parties deal at arm’s length, the doctrine of
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caveat emptor</span></i> applies; but the moment the vendor makes a false statement
of fact, and its falsity is not palpable to the purchaser, he has an
undoubted right implicitly to rely upon it. That would, indeed, be a
strange rule of law which, when the seller had successfully entrapped
his victim by false statements, and was called to account in a court of
justice for his deceit, would permit him to escape by urging the folly
of his dupe for not suspecting that he, the seller, was a knave. In the
absence of such a suspicion, it is entirely reasonable for one to put faith
in the deliberate representations of another. The jury must have
understood that the means were at hand to discover the claim, because
the defendant might have measured the wire, counted the poles,
examined the gas mains, ascertained how much customers were paying
for gas and electric light, and might have hired an expert to examine
into the earnings and expenses of the plaintiff in running the plant,
with a view to discovering whether a business man had told the truth.
It should not have been left to the jury to determine whether the
means were at hand to discover the falsity of the statements made,
in view of the character of such statements and the nature of the
property sold. The defendant, as a matter of law, had a right to
rely implicitly upon the statements made by plaintiff touching the
character of this plant. So long as defendant did not actually know
the representations to be false, it was under no obligation to investigate
to determine their truth or falsity. In Mead <em>v.</em> Bunn, 32 N. Y.
280, the court say: “Every contracting party has an absolute right
to rely on the express statements of an existing fact, the truth of which
is known to the opposite party and unknown to him, as a basis of
mutual engagement, and he is under no obligation to investigate and
verify statements, to the truth of which the other party to the contract,
with full means of knowledge, has deliberately pledged his
faith.” In Redding <em>v.</em> Wright, (Minn.) 51 N. W. 1056 (a case very
much in point), the court say: “If the representations were fraudulently
made with the intent to induce the plaintiff to rely upon the
fact being as represented, and to act upon the belief thus induced, the
wrong-doer who succeeds in such a purpose is not to be shielded from
responsibility by the plea that the defrauded party would have discovered
the falsity of the representation if he had pursued such means
of information as were available to him.” While the rule has been in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span>some cases stated in terms more favorable to plaintiff, yet no decision
can be found which establishes a doctrine under which defendant
would be bound, under the circumstances of this case, to make any
investigation or inquiry touching the truth or falsity of the statements
made in connection with the sale. There are many well considered
cases which sustain our view that defendant had a right implicitly to
rely upon the representations made by plaintiff with respect to the
character of the property to be purchased by defendant. In addition
to the cases already cited, we refer to Maxfield <em>v.</em> Schwartz, 45 Minn.
150, 47 N. W. 448; Gardner <em>v.</em> Trenary, 65 Iowa, 646, 22 N. W. 912;
Schumaker <em>v.</em> Mather, 133 N. Y. 590, 30 N. E. 755; McClellan <em>v.</em>
Scott, 24 Wis. 81; Caldwell <em>v.</em> Henry, 76 Mo. 254; Oswald <em>v.</em> McGehee,
28 Miss. 340; Cottrill <em>v.</em> Krum, 100 Mo. 397, 13 S. W. 753; Campbell
<em>v.</em> Frankern, 65 Ind. 591; Kerr, Fraud &amp; M. 77, 80, 81; Erickson <em>v.</em>
Fisher, (Minn.) 53 N. W. 638; Alfred Shrimpton &amp; Sons <em>v.</em> Philbrik,
(Minn.) 55 N. W. 551; Barndt <em>v.</em> Frederick, (Wis.) 47 N. W. 6; Bigelow,
Fraud, 522, 528. We are aware that cases can be found which
exact from the buyer more care in ascertaining the truth or falsity of
representations than the decisions just cited. These cases appear to us
to have been rightfully decided, in view of the facts. In determining
what the courts in such cases intended to hold, the language of each
opinion must be read, in the light of the facts of the particular case.
The unmistakable drift is towards the just doctrine that the wrong-doer
cannot shield himself from liability by asking the law to condemn
the credulity of his victim. The falsity of the statement may be apparent
because the thing misrepresented is before the buyer, and the
most casual look will suffice to discover the falsehood, no artifice being
used to divert his attention; or the statement may carry its own refutation
upon its face,—may be so absurd or monstrous that it is
palpably false, as a statement by a person carrying on a business
known to the purchaser to be very small that the receipts of the business
are a million dollars a year. In these and other similar cases the
law will not allow a person to assert that he was deceived. But the
general rule is, and, upon principle, must be, that the question is one of
reliance by the buyer upon the false statement of the seller. Whether
it was wise for him to rely upon it, whether he was prudent in so doing,
whether he is not chargeable with negligence in a certain sense in not
investigating,—these inquiries are, in general, immaterial, provided
the purchaser has in fact been deceived. The circumstances under
which fraud is accomplished are so varied, the nature of the property
and the character of the misrepresentations are so widely different, in
different cases, that it is unwise to attempt to enunciate with precision
a general rule by which all cases shall be governed. It is better to
decide the cases as they arise, keeping in view the general principle
that courts will not readily listen to the plea that the defrauded party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>was too easily deceived. For this error in the charge, the judgment
will be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>STARKWEATHER <em>v.</em> BENJAMIN<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Michigan, June Term, 1875.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 32 Michigan Reports, 305.</em></h4>

<p class='c022'>Error to Macomb Circuit.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Campbell, J.</span> This action was brought to recover damages arising from
alleged misrepresentations made by Starkweather to Benjamin concerning the
quantity of land in a parcel purchased from Starkweather and others, for
whom he acted, and which was bought by the acre.</p>

<p class='c019'>The defence rested mainly on the ground that the purchaser saw the land,
and was as able to judge of its size as Starkweather.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>We do not think the doctrine that where both parties have equal means of
judging there is no fraud applies to such a case. The maxim is equally valid,
that one who dissuades another from inquiry and deceives him to his prejudice
is responsible. It cannot be generally true that persons can judge of the contents
of a parcel of land by the eye. When any approach to accuracy is
needed, there must be measurement. When a positive assurance of the area
of a parcel of land is made by the vendor to the vendee with the design of making
the vendee believe it, that assurance is very material, and equivalent to an
assurance of measurement. In this case the testimony goes very far, and
shows that the assertions and representations, which the jury must have found
to be true, were of such a nature that if believed, as they were, a re-survey
must have been an idle ceremony. They were calculated to deceive, and as
the jury have found, they did deceive Benjamin, and he had a clear right of
action for the fraud.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>MABARDY <em>v.</em> McHUGH<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, May 21, 1909.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 202 Massachusetts Reports, 148.</em></h4>

<p class='c022'>Tort for deceit in the sale of land. Writ in the Superior Court for the
county of Middlesex dated January 18, 1906.</p>

<p class='c019'>The case was tried before Stevens, J. The facts are stated in the opinion.
The jury found for the defendants; and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Rugg, J.</span> This is an action of tort sounding in deceit. There was evidence
tending to show that the plaintiffs went upon a certain irregularly shaped
tract of land (for false representations inducing the purchase of which this
action was brought) with one of the defendants, who pointed out the true
boundaries and fraudulently stated that the tract contained sixty-five acres,
when in fact it contained forty and three-fourths acres. Upon this aspect of
the evidence, the trial judge instructed the jury that “if the plaintiffs&#160;...
were taken over the farm by the defendants&#160;... or [and] were shown the
bounds so that the plaintiffs knew where the farm was and what was comprised
within the bounds, it would not be of any consequence that representations
may have been made by the defendant in relation to the acreage.”
The evidence being conflicting as to whether the boundaries were shown, the
jury were further instructed that if the defendant, who talked with the plaintiffs,
“knew that there were not sixty-five or nearly sixty-five acres, or if he
did not know anything about it and stated it as a fact within his personal
knowledge, then it would be a false representation for which he would be
liable provided” the other elements essential to a recovery were found to
exist.</p>

<p class='c019'>The correctness of the first of these instructions is challenged. It is in
exact accordance with the law as laid down in Gordon <em>v.</em> Parmelee, 2 Allen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_614'>614</span>212, and Mooney <em>v.</em> Miller, 102 Mass. 217. The facts in the case at bar are
similar in all material respects to these cases. An attempt is made to distinguish
them on the ground that the present plaintiffs were Syrians, ignorant of
our language, and that hence a trust relation existed between them and the
defendant. But whatever else may be said of this contention, it fails because
they were accompanied by two of their own countrymen, who were thoroughly
familiar with our language and acted as interpreters for them. In effect, the
contention of the plaintiffs amounts to a request to overrule these two cases.
They have been cited with approval in Roberts <em>v.</em> French, 153 Mass. 60, and
as supporting authorities, without criticism, in other opinions. The court,
however, has refused to apply the rule of those decisions to other facts closely
analogous. See Lewis <em>v.</em> Jewell, 151 Mass. 345; Holst <em>v.</em> Stewart, 161 Mass.
516; Whiting <em>v.</em> Price, 172 Mass. 240; Kilgore <em>v.</em> Bruce, 166 Mass. 136. This
court in recent years, by pointed language and by conclusions reached, has
indicated a plain disposition not to extend legal immunity for the falsehood of
vendors in the course of negotiations for sales beyond the bounds already
established....</p>

<p class='c019'>This judicial attitude perhaps reflects an increasingly pervasive moral
sense in some of the common transactions of trade. While the science of
jurisprudence is not, and under present conditions cannot be, co-extensive
with the domain of morality, nor generally undertake to differentiate between
motives which mark acts as good or bad, yet it is true, as was said by Mr. Justice
Brett, in Robinson <em>v.</em> Mollett, L. R. 7 H. L. 802, 817, that “The courts
have applied to the mercantile business brought before them what have been
called legal principles, which have almost always been the fundamental
ethical rules of right and wrong.” This is only a concrete expression of the
broader generalization that law is the manifestation of the conscience of the
Commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c019'>In many other jurisdictions the rule of Gordon <em>v.</em> Parmelee and Mooney <em>v.</em>
Miller has not been followed and false representations as to area of land, even
though true boundaries were pointed out, have been held actionable. McGhee
<em>v.</em> Bell, 170 Mo. 121, 135, 150. May <em>v.</em> Loomis, 140 N. C. 350. Boddy <em>v.</em>
Henry, 113 Iowa, 462, 465; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span> 126 Iowa, 31. Antle <em>v.</em> Sexton, 137 Ill. 410.
Estes <em>v.</em> Odom, 91 Ga. 600, 609. Lovejoy <em>v.</em> Isbell, 73 Conn. 368, 375. Cawston
<em>v.</em> Sturgis, 20 Ore. 331. Starkweather <em>v.</em> Benjamin, 32 Mich. 305. Paine
<em>v.</em> Upton, 87 N. Y. 327. Mitchell <em>v.</em> Zimmerman, 4 Texas, 75. Walling <em>v.</em>
Kinnard, 10 Texas, 508. Speed <em>v.</em> Hollingsworth, 54 Kans. 436. See also
Fairchild <em>v.</em> McMahon, 139 N. Y. 290; Schumaker <em>v.</em> Mather, 133 N. Y. 590.</p>

<p class='c019'>Other cases apparently opposed to the Massachusetts rule, on examination
prove to go no further than to decide that misrepresentations as to area, when
there is no evidence that boundaries were shown, constitute deceit. Griswold
<em>v.</em> Gebbie, 126 Penn. St. 353. Cabot <em>v.</em> Christie, 42 Vt. 121. Coon <em>v.</em> Atwell,
46 N. H. 510. Ledbetter <em>v.</em> Davis, 121 Ind. 119. Perkins Manuf. Co. <em>v.</em> Williams,
98 Ga. 388. Sears <em>v.</em> Stinson, 3 Wash. 615. Hill <em>v.</em> Brower, 76 N. C.
124. Stearns <em>v.</em> Kennedy, 94 Minn. 439. This is the substance of the latter
part of the instruction given in the Superior Court, and is the law of this
Commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c019'>The rule of Mooney <em>v.</em> Miller seemingly has been approved or followed in
Lynch <em>v.</em> Mercantile Trust Co., 18 Fed. Rep. 486; Crown <em>v.</em> Carriger, 66 Ala.
590; and Mires <em>v.</em> Summerville, 85 Mo. App. 183, although the last case has
been overruled in Judd <em>v.</em> Walker, 114 Mo. App. 128, 135.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span>If the point were now presented for the first time, it is possible that we
might be convinced by the argument of the plaintiffs and the great weight of
persuasive authority in its support, especially in view of Lewis <em>v.</em> Jewell, 151
Mass. 345. But there is something to be said in support of the two earlier
decisions now questioned. A purchase and a sale of real estate is a transaction
of importance and cannot be treated as entered into lightly. People
must use their own faculties for their protection and information, and cannot
assume that the law will relieve them from the natural effects of their heedlessness
or take better care of their interests than they themselves do. Thrift,
foresight and self-reliance would be undermined if it was the policy of the
law to attempt to afford relief for mere want of sagacity. It is an ancient and
widely, if not universally, accepted principle of the law of deceit that, where
representations are made respecting a subject as to which the complaining
party has at hand reasonably available means for ascertaining the truth and
the matter is open to inspection, if, without being fraudulently diverted
therefrom, he does not take advantage of this opportunity, he cannot be heard
to impeach the transaction on the ground of the falsehoods of the other party.
Salem India Rubber Co. <em>v.</em> Adams, 23 Pick. 256, 265. Slaughter <em>v.</em> Gerson, 13
Wall. 379, 383. Long <em>v.</em> Warren, 68 N. Y. 426, 432. Baily <em>v.</em> Merrell, 3
Bulstr. 94. This rule in its general statement applies to such a case as that
before us. It is easy for one disappointed in the fruits of a trade to imagine,
and perhaps persuade himself, that the cause of his loss is the deceit of the
other party, rather than his own want of judgment.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is highly desirable that laws for conduct in ordinary affairs, in themselves
easy of comprehension and memory, when once established, should
remain fast. The doctrine of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">stare decisis</span></i> is as salutary as it is well recognized....
While perhaps it is more important as to far-reaching juridical
principles that the court should be right, in the light of higher civilization,
later and more careful examination of authorities, wider and more thorough
discussion and more mature reflection upon the policy of the law, than merely
in harmony with previous decisions (Barden <em>v.</em> Northern Pacific Railroad, 154
U. S. 288, 322), it nevertheless is vital that there be stability in the courts in
adhering to decisions deliberately made after ample consideration. Parties
should not be encouraged to seek re-examination of determined principles and
speculate on a fluctuation of the law with every change in the expounders of
it. As to many matters of frequent occurrence, the establishment of some certain
guide is of more significance than the precise form of the rule. It is
likely that no positive rule of law can be laid down that will not at some time
impinge with great apparent severity upon a morally innocent person. The
law of gravitation acts indifferently upon the just and the unjust. A renewed
declaration of law that is already in force, supported by sound reason and not
plainly wrong, in the long run probably works out substantial justice, although
it may seem harsh in its application to some particular case. These
considerations are regarded as so weighty by the House of Lords that it cannot
overrule any of its own decisions. London Tramways Co. <em>v.</em> London
County Council, [1898] A. C. 375.</p>

<p class='c019'>The conclusion is that we do not overrule the decisions whose soundness
has been debated at the bar, although we do not extend their scope, but confine
them strictly to their precise point, namely, that where the seller of real
estate shows upon the face of the earth its true boundaries to the purchaser
and does not fraudulently dissuade him from making full examination and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>measurement and the estate is not so extensive or of such character as to be
reasonably incapable of inspection and estimate, and there is no relation of
trust between the parties, the purchaser has no remedy for a misrepresentation
as to the area alone....</p>

<h4 class='c013'>EASTERN TRUST &amp; BANKING COMPANY <em>v.</em> CUNNINGHAM<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Maine, February 20, 1908.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 103 Maine Reports, 455.</em></h4>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Savage, J.</span> But the defendant contends further, that, if the plaintiff did
not know, it ought to have known, and would have known but for its own
negligence. We think this defence cannot avail. There are cases which hold
that where one carelessly relies upon a pretence of inherent absurdity and incredibility
upon mere idle talk, or upon a device so shadowy as not to be
capable of imposing upon any one, he must bear his misfortune, if injured.
He must not shut his eyes to what is palpably before him. But that doctrine,
if sound, is not applicable here. We think the well-settled rule to be applied
here is that if one intentionally misrepresents to another facts particularly
within his own knowledge, with an intent that the other shall act upon
them, and he does so act, he cannot afterwards excuse himself by saying,
“You were foolish to believe me.” It does not lie in his mouth to say that the
one trusting him was negligent. In this case the fact whether or not there
were funds in the Gardiner bank to meet the checks was peculiarly within the
knowledge of the defendant. The rule is stated in Pollock on Torts, § 252,
as follows: “It is now settled law that one who chooses to make positive
assertions without warrant shall not excuse himself by saying that the other
party need not have relied upon them. He must show that his representation
was not in fact relied upon. In short, nothing will excuse a culpable misrepresentation
short of proof that it was not relied upon, either because the
other party knew the truth, or because he relied wholly on his own investigations,
or because the alleged fact did not influence his action at all.” In
Linington <em>v.</em> Strong, 107 Ill. 295, we find this language: “The doctrine is well
settled that as a rule a party guilty of fraudulent conduct shall not be allowed
to cry ‘negligence’ as against his own deliberate fraud.... While the law
does require of all parties the exercise of reasonable prudence in the business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>of life, and does not permit one to rest indifferent in reliance upon the interested
representations of an adverse party, still, as before suggested, there
is a certain limitation to this rule; and, as between the original parties to the
transaction we consider that, when it appears that one party has been guilty
of an intentional and deliberate fraud by which to his knowledge the other
party has been misled or influenced in his action, he cannot escape the legal
consequences of his fraudulent conduct by saying that the fraud might have
been discovered had the party whom he deceived exercised reasonable diligence
and care.” See Griffin <em>v.</em> Roanoke R. &amp; Lumber Co., 140 N. C. 514, 53

<p class='c022'>The Dublin Corporation having by their agents furnished the appellants
with plans, drawings, and specifications, the appellants contracted to execute
certain sewage outfall works according to the plans, &amp;c. In the plans, &amp;c.,
representations were made as to the existence and position of a certain wall.
In the contract (clauses 43, 46, 47, 48) it was stipulated that the contractor
should satisfy himself as to the dimensions, levels and nature of all existing
works and other things connected with the contract works; that the corporation
did not hold itself responsible for the accuracy of the information as to
the sections or foundations of existing walls and works; and that no charges
for extra work or otherwise would be allowed in consequence of incorrect information
or inaccuracies in the drawings or specifications. The appellants
performed the contract, and brought an action of deceit against the corporation,
claiming damages for false representations as to the position, dimensions
and foundations of the wall, whereby the appellants were compelled to execute
more costly works than would otherwise have been required. The plans,
drawings and specifications were prepared by engineers employed by the
corporation.<a id='r368'></a><a href='#f368' class='c015'><sup>[368]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>[At the trial before <span class='sc'>Palles, C. B.</span>, the plaintiffs offered evidence tending
to show that the aforesaid representations were not sincerely believed by the
engineers to be true.] <span class='sc'>Palles, C. B.</span>, refused to leave any question to the jury,
and entered judgment for the respondents on the ground that the contractors
were bound by their contract to verify for themselves all the information
given in the plans, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c019'>The King’s Bench Division (Wright, Boyd, and Gibson, JJ., Lord O’Brien,
C. J., dissenting) reversed the decision of Palles, C. B., and entered judgment
for the appellants on the ground that there was a question of fact for the jury
upon the allegation of fraud.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>The Court of Appeal (Sir Samuel Walker, L. C., Fitzgibbon and Holmes,
L.JJ.) reversed that decision, and restored the decision of Palles, C. B.</p>

<p class='c019'>Plaintiff appealed to the House of Lords.</p>

<p class='c019'>The House of Lords (<span class='sc'>Lords Loreburn</span>, <span class='sc'>Halsbury</span>, <span class='sc'>Ashbourne</span>, <span class='sc'>Macnaghten</span>,
<span class='sc'>James of Hereford</span>, <span class='sc'>Robertson</span>, <span class='sc'>Atkinson</span>, and <span class='sc'>Collins</span>) reversed
the order of the Court of Appeal, and restored the judgment of the
King’s Bench Division. Portions of the opinions are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Lord Loreburn, L. C.</span>... Now it seems clear that no one can escape liability
for his own fraudulent statements by inserting in a contract a clause
that the other party shall not rely upon them. I will not say that a man himself
innocent may not under any circumstances, however peculiar, guard himself
by apt and express clauses from liability for the fraud of his own agents.
It suffices to say that in my opinion the clauses before us do not admit of such
a construction. They contemplate honesty on both sides and protect only
against honest mistakes. The principal and the agent are one, and it does not
signify which of them made the incriminated statement or which of them possessed
the guilty knowledge.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Earl of Halsbury.</span>... The action is based on the allegation of fraud,
and no subtilty of language, no craft or machinery in the form of contract, can
estop a person who complains that he has been defrauded from having that
question of fact submitted to a jury....</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Lord Ashbourne.</span>... [As to clause 43.] Such a clause might in some
cases be part of a fraud, and might advance and disguise a fraud, and I cannot
think that on the facts and circumstances of this case it can have such a
wide and perilous application as was contended for. Such a clause may be
appropriate and fairly apply to errors, inaccuracies, and mistakes, but not to
cases like the present....</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Lord James of Hereford.</span>... Now the learned Chief Baron in respect
of this clause expressed the opinion that the contractor was not entitled in
point of law to say he acted upon the statement contained in the plans. He
was told to act upon his own judgment, and ought to have done so.</p>

<p class='c019'>If this dictum be read as general in its terms, and so applied, it may be read
as conferring considerable advantage upon the designers of fraud. At any
rate, by inserting such a clause those who framed it would run a fair chance of
the contractor saying, “I assume that those with whom I deal are honest and
honorable men. I scout the idea of their being guilty of fraud. An inquiry
testing the plan will be expensive and difficult, and so I will not make it.”
The protecting clause might be inserted fraudulently, with the purpose and
hope that, notwithstanding its terms, no test would take place. When the
fraud succeeds, surely those who designed the fraudulent protection cannot
take advantage of it. Such a clause would be good protection against any
mistake or miscalculation, but fraud vitiates every contract and every clause
in it. As a general principle I incline to the view that an express term that
fraud shall not vitiate a contract would be bad in law, but it is unnecessary in
this case to determine whether special circumstances may not create an exception
to that rule.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Lord Atkinson.</span>... If, therefore, the <em>direction</em> given to the jury is to be
upheld on the grounds upon which it was purported to be based, it must, in
my opinion, be because these several articles of the contract, on their true construction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span>are to be held to embody a contract by the plaintiffs that they in
effect are not, under any circumstances, to have a remedy by action for deceit
for any fraud which may be practised upon them by the defendants or by
those acting on their behalf in the nature of a false representation, that is a
contract to submit to a fraud.</p>

<p class='c019'>As at present advised I am inclined to think, on the authority of Tullis <em>v.</em>
Jacson, [1892] 3 Ch. 441, and Brownlie <em>v.</em> Campbell, (1880) 5 App. Cas. 925,
937, 956, that such a contract would be illegal in point of law. And, with the
most profound respect for the Chief Baron, I do not think that the articles of
the contract relied upon can, on their true construction, be held to have had
fraud, whether conscious or unconscious, within their purview or contemplation,
or to apply at all to such a case of fraud as the present is alleged to be.
They were, I think, intended to apply, and do apply, to inaccuracies, errors,
and mistakes, or matters of that sort, but not to fraud, whether of principal or
agent, or of both combined.<a id='r369'></a><a href='#f369' class='c015'><sup>[369]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<h4 class='c013'>HALBERSTADT <em>v.</em> NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE CO.<br /> <span class='sc'>Court of Appeals, New York, January 5, 1909.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 194 New York Reports, 1.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>The action is brought to recover damages for an alleged malicious
prosecution claimed to have been instituted by the respondent against
the appellant in Mexico. It is in the complaint, amongst other things,
alleged that the respondent through its agent in the Criminal Court
of the city of Mexico charged the appellant with the crime of embezzlement
“and thereupon and in and by virtue of said charge and
the institution of said criminal proceedings a warrant was issued by
said court for the arrest of the plaintiff (in this action),” and that
thereafter “the said criminal proceedings for the punishment of said
plaintiff were dismissed and extinguished and the said prosecution
was thereby wholly determined&#160;... in favor of the plaintiff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The respondent, by its second defence, which is challenged here
for insufficiency, alleged, in substance, that before the warrant referred
to in the complaint could be served upon the appellant and before he
could be apprehended, “he left the Republic of Mexico and thereafter
continuously remained absent&#160;... and by such absence avoided
being arrested under such warrant, or being tried&#160;... but remained
absent from said Republic of Mexico for a sufficient period of time to
enable him to procure the dismissal of said proceedings under the law
of Mexico on account solely of the lapse of time,” and, conversely, that
said criminal proceedings “were not dismissed on account of a determination
of the case in favor of the plaintiff on the trial thereof on the
merits, nor was it dismissed for failure to prosecute said case except as
above set forth, nor was it dismissed on account of any withdrawal of
the complaint.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff demurred to this defence and also to the third defence
which was not materially different from the second. The demurrer
was sustained at Special Term. This judgment was reversed by the
General Term, and the plaintiff now appeals.<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c015'><sup>[370]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Hiscock, J.</span> The respondent’s first reply to the appellant’s attack
upon its answer is of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tu quoque</span></i> nature, it insisting that the complaint
is as deficient in the statement of a good cause of action as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span>answer is alleged to be in the statement of a good defence. This contention
is based upon the fact that the complaint does not allege any
act subsequent or in addition to the mere issuance of a warrant in the
criminal proceeding complained of; does not allege that the warrant
was ever executed in any way whatever, or that the appellant was ever
actually brought into said proceedings either by force of process or
voluntary appearance. Therefore, the question is presented whether
the mere application for and issuance to a proper officer for execution
of a warrant on a criminal charge may institute and constitute such a
prosecution as may be made the basis of a subsequent civil action by
the party claimed to have been injured. In considering this question
we must keep in mind that the facts alleged in the complaint, and in
the light of which it is to be determined, do not show, as the answer
does, that the defendant in those proceedings was beyond the jurisdiction
of the court.</p>

<p class='c007'>This question does not seem to have been settled by any decision
which we regard as controlling on us.</p>

<p class='c007'>The respondent cites the following authorities deciding it in the
negative: Newfield <em>v.</em> Copperman, 15 Abb. Pr., <span class='fss'>N. S.</span>, 360; Lawyer <em>v.</em>
Loomis, 3 T. &amp; C. 393; Cooper <em>v.</em> Armour, 42 Fed. 215; Heyward
<em>v.</em> Cuthbert, 4 McCord, 354; O’Driscoll <em>v.</em> M’Burney, 2 Nott &amp;
McCord, 54; Bartlett <em>v.</em> Cristliff, 14 Atl. R. 518; Gregory <em>v.</em> Derby,
8 C. &amp; P. 749; Paul <em>v.</em> Fargo, 84 App. Div. 9.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case last cited was concerned with an alleged malicious prosecution
by means of civil process and what was there said must be
interpreted with reference to that fact, and thus interpreted it is not
applicable here. Of the other cases, only two, Heyward <em>v.</em> Cuthbert
and Cooper <em>v.</em> Armour, considered the question here involved with
sufficient thoroughness to require brief comment. An examination
will show that the decision in each of them rested in whole or part on
a principle not, as I believe, adopted in this state. In the former it
was said that “The foundation of this sort of action is the wrong done
to the plaintiff by the direct detention or imprisonment of his person.”
As I think we shall see hereafter, that is not a correct statement of
the law in this state. In the other case it was stated, “The only injury
sustained by the person accused, when he is not taken into custody,
and no process has been issued against him, is to his reputation;
and for such an injury the action of libel or slander is the appropriate
remedy, and would seem to be the only remedy.” I think that this
doctrine, which if correct would provide an adequate remedy outside
of an action for malicious prosecution for an injured party in a case
where no warrant had been executed, also is opposed to the weight of
authority both in this state and elsewhere hereafter to be referred to.</p>

<p class='c007'>The authorities holding to the contrary on the question above
stated, and that the execution of the warrant is not necessary to lay
the foundation for an action of malicious prosecution, are: Addison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>on Torts, vol. 2 [4th Eng. ed.], p. 478; Newell on Malicious Prosecution,
sect. 30; Stephens on Malicious Prosecution, Am. ed., sect. 8;
Stapp <em>v.</em> Partlow, Dudley’s Repts., (Ga.) 176; Clarke <em>v.</em> Postan, 6 C.
&amp; P. 423; Fezale <em>v.</em> Simpson, 2 Ill. 30; Britton <em>v.</em> Granger, 13 Ohio Cir.
Ct. Repts. 281, 291; Holmes <em>v.</em> Johnson, Busbee’s L. R. 44; Coffey <em>v.</em>
Myers, 84 Ind. 105.</p>

<p class='c007'>And to the like effect in the absence of special statutory provisions
in Swift <em>v.</em> Witchard, 103 Ga. 193.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it is apparent, as before stated, that there is no controlling
decision on this question and we are remitted to a search for some
general considerations which may be decisive. It seems to me that
these may be found and that they favor the view that a prosecution
may be regarded as having been instituted even though a warrant has
not been executed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first one of these considerations is found in the rule applied in
civil actions and proceedings to an analogous situation. There it has
many times been held that the mere issue of various forms of civil
process for service or other execution is sufficient independent of
statute to effect the commencement of a case or proceeding. Carpenter
<em>v.</em> Butterfield, 3 Johns. Cases, 146; Cheetham <em>v.</em> Lewis, 3 Johns.
42; Bronson <em>v.</em> Earl, 17 Johns. 63; Ross <em>v.</em> Luther, 4 Cowen, 158;
Mills <em>v.</em> Corbett, 8 How. Pr. 500; Hancock <em>v.</em> Ritchie, 11 Ind. 48, 52;
Howell <em>v.</em> Shepard, 48 Mich. 472; Webster <em>v.</em> Sharpe, 116 N. C. 466,
471.</p>

<p class='c007'>I see no reason why a similar rule should not be applied to criminal
proceedings, at least for the purposes of such an action as this.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then there is another reason resting on justice which seems to me
to lead us to adopt this conclusion. In opposition to what was said
in the South Carolina case already referred to, the sole foundation for
an action of malicious prosecution is not “the wrong done to the plaintiff
by the direct detention or imprisonment of his person.” In an
action for false imprisonment that would be so. But in an action
of the present type, the substantial injury for which damages are
recovered and which serves as a basis for the action may be that inflicted
upon the feelings, reputation and character by a false accusation
as well as that caused by arrest and imprisonment. This element
“indeed is in many cases the gravamen of the action.” Sheldon <em>v.</em>
Carpenter, 4 N. Y. 579, 580; Woods <em>v.</em> Finnell, 13 Bush Repts. 628;
Townsend on Slander, sec. 420; Wheeler <em>v.</em> Hanson, 161 Mass. 370;
Gundermann <em>v.</em> Buschner, 73 Ill. App. 180; Lawrence <em>v.</em> Hagerman,
56 Ill. 68; Davis <em>v.</em> Seeley, 91 Iowa, 583.</p>

<p class='c007'>But no matter how false and damaging the charge may be in a
criminal proceeding upon which a warrant may be issued, damages for
the injury caused thereby cannot under any ordinary circumstances
be recovered in an action for libel or slander. Howard <em>v.</em> Thompson,
21 Wend. 319, 324; Woods <em>v.</em> Wiman, 47 Hun, 362, 364; Sheldon <em>v.</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>Carpenter, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>; Dale <em>v.</em> Harris, 109 Mass. 193; Gabriel <em>v.</em> McMullin,
127 Iowa, 427; Hamilton <em>v.</em> Eno, 81 N. Y. 116; Newell on Malicious
Prosecution, sec. 10.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore, it follows that a person who has most grievously injured
another by falsely making a serious criminal accusation against him
whereon a warrant has been actually issued, may escape all liability
by procuring the warrant at that point to be withheld unless an action
for malicious prosecution will lie. It seems to me that under such
circumstances we should hold that such action will lie, if for no other
reason than to satisfy that principle of law which demands an adequate
remedy for every legal wrong.<a id='r371'></a><a href='#f371' class='c015'><sup>[371]</sup></a>...</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Vann, J.</span> I concur in the result because there was merely an attempt
to prosecute with no actual prosecution. The Mexican court
did not acquire jurisdiction of the person of the plaintiff, for he was
not arrested, nor was process or notice of any kind served upon him.
He was not brought into court and the prosecution could not end because
it was never begun. He could not be a party defendant until
he was notified or voluntarily appeared. He was threatened with
prosecution, but neither his person nor his property was touched.
There can be no prosecution unless knowledge thereof is brought
home to the alleged defendant in some way. If there had been a
prosecution commenced the crime could not have outlawed during the
defendant’s absence, as is admitted of record. While in civil actions,
in order to arrest the Statute of Limitations, “an attempt to commence
an action, in a court of record, is equivalent to the commencement
thereof,” still the attempt goes for naught unless followed by
service, actual or constructive, within sixty days. (Code Civil Proc.
§ 399.) The rule was similar at common law. Although, in order
to prevent injustice, an action was deemed to be commenced by the
delivery of process for service, it was never treated as effectual for
any purpose unless actual service was subsequently made. The authorities
cited in the prevailing opinion illustrate this proposition.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the absence of controlling authority, which it is conceded does
not exist, I favor restricting rather than enlarging the scope of the
action. This accords with the general position of the court upon the
subject.</p>

<p class='c022'>An action for a malicious prosecution of an indictment for perjury.</p>

<p class='c019'>Upon the trial it appeared, the perjury was ill-assigned, so that the now

by the judge, and he was acquitted without any examination of witnesses.
But the Chief Justice held the action lay, though it was a faulty indictment,
relying upon the case of Jones <em>v.</em> Gwynn, where the distinction in Salk. 13
was denied, and held by the whole court that the action would lie, though the
indictment was bad; a bad indictment serving all the purposes of malice, by
putting the party to expense, and exposing him, but it serves no purpose of
justice in bringing the party to punishment if he be guilty.<a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c015'><sup>[373]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>This was an action for a malicious prosecution in indicting the plaintiff

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Mansfield, C. J.</span> I feel a difficulty to understand how the plaintiff could

he clearly has not proved that he has sustained any: I can understand the

contains scandal, but this contains none, nor does any danger of imprisonment
result from it: this bill was a piece of mere waste paper. All the cases in
Buller’s Nisi Prius, 13, are directly against this action, for the author speaks
of putting the plaintiff to expense, and affecting his good fame, neither of
which could be done here. If this action could be maintained, every bill which
the grand jury threw out would be the ground of an action. The judge too
might certify in this cause against the costs, if the damages had been under

<h4 class='c013'>STEWARD <em>v.</em> GROMETT<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Common Pleas, November 11, 1859.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 7 Common Bench Reports, New Series, 191.</em></h4>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Erle, C. J.</span><a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c015'><sup>[377]</sup></a> I am of opinion that our judgment in this case must be for
the plaintiff. It is an action against the defendant for falsely and maliciously,
and without reasonable or probable cause, making information on oath before
a magistrate that the plaintiff had used threatening language to him, whereby
he went in fear of bodily harm, and so procuring a warrant under which the
plaintiff was incarcerated in the castle at Swaffham, for want of sureties, for
a period of six months. It is admitted on the pleadings that the defendant
did falsely and maliciously, and without reasonable or probable cause, procure
that wrong to be done to the plaintiff; and the question is whether the
declaration shows enough to entitle the plaintiff to maintain an action for
that wrong. This is in some sort an action for a malicious prosecution; and
it has been contended by Mr. Couch, for the defendant, that the case falls
within the ordinary rule applicable to such actions, that the plaintiff must
show that the proceeding terminated in his favor, and that no action lies
where they are shown to have terminated against the accused. But I am of
opinion that the distinction taken by Mr. Keane removes that objection, and
shows that that rule does not apply to this case, because the proceeding before
the magistrate being founded upon a statement which the party charged is
not at liberty to controvert, is an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> proceeding, and, although it attains
the result which is sought, it is not a judgment, but is in the nature of a writ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>of process. It is not like the case of an application to a magistrate upon a
matter on which he is to exercise his discretion: there, the injury sustained
by the party is the act of the law, and therefore no action lies unless the
person who sets the magistrate in motion is actuated by malice. But here the
law was directly put in motion by the defendant against the plaintiff, and,
it must be assumed, falsely and maliciously and without reasonable or probable
cause. If a party goes before a judge, under the 1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 110, with
an affidavit of debt for the purpose of procuring a capias to arrest his debtor,
upon a suggestion that he is going abroad, and that is done falsely and maliciously,
and without reasonable or probable cause, an action lies. So, if a
party go to the Court of Queen’s Bench, and maliciously exhibit articles of
the peace against another, supported by a false oath that such other had used
threats against him, his statement being incontrovertible, it is clear to my
mind that an action would lie. Can it make any difference that here the proceeding
took place before a magistrate? It seems to me that the two proceedings
are quite analogous: the same remedy is sought, only by a different mode.
As in the one case the truth of the articles cannot be controverted, so in the
other the statement made before the magistrate upon oath cannot be contradicted
by the accused. There is not the least sign of authority to show that
the magistrate had any discretion, so that the plaintiff might have had a decision
in his favor. In Burn’s Justice, sureties of the peace are treated as being
subject to precisely the same rule as articles of the peace at the sessions or
in the Court of Queen’s Bench, in respect of their truth being incontrovertible.
And there is strong reason for assuming that to be the true state of the law;
the fact of there being no authority exactly in point as to sureties of the
peace, may well be accounted for by supposing that no one has entertained
doubt enough upon it to take the opinion of any court. But as far as authority
goes, The King <em>v.</em> Doherty, 13 East, 171, and Venafra <em>v.</em> Johnson, 10 Bing.
301, 3 M. &amp; Sc. 807, are in favor of the plaintiff. In the latter case, Johnson
made precisely the same application to the justices as was made here, and
they exercised a precisely analogous jurisdiction, the only difference being that
there the magistrates held the plaintiff to bail for his appearance at the sessions,
whereas here the magistrate at once committed the plaintiff to jail until
he should find the required sureties: and it was there decided by implication
that the proceeding before the magistrate was incontrovertible; for, the court
held that the judge was wrong in not leaving it to the jury to say whether
or not the defendant believed the menaces when he put the law in motion
against the plaintiff. If Mr. Couch’s argument to-day is right, the counsel
and the court in that case were all wrong. Upon principle, therefore, and
upon authority, it seems to me that the argument for the plaintiff in this case
ought to prevail.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>BROWN <em>v.</em> RANDALL<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Connecticut, March Term, 1869.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 36 Connecticut Reports, 56.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Carpenter, J.</span><a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c015'><sup>[380]</sup></a> The defendants complained to a grandjuror of the
town of Norwich against the plaintiff, charging him with a breach of
the peace, and induced the grandjuror to enter a complaint to a magistrate
in due form, whereupon a warrant was issued, and the plaintiff
arrested and held to answer the complaint. After remaining in custody
several hours, the magistrate informed the defendants and their
counsel, who acted for the grandjuror, that he was ready to proceed
with the trial. The defendants sent word to the court that they should
prosecute the complaint no further, and thereupon the plaintiff was
discharged. It is alleged in the declaration that this proceeding was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span>malicious and without probable cause, and the jury have found that
allegation to be true.</p>

<p class='c007'>The important question in this case is whether, upon the facts
alleged and proved, the plaintiff is entitled to recover. All the material
averments seem to have been proved except the allegation of acquittal.
That was not proved, and the court charged the jury that it was
not necessary. The defendants complain of this, as they rely upon
the non-existence of that fact as a complete defence to the action.
Decisions of courts of the highest respectability, both in England and
in this country, justify this claim. It does not appear that this question
has ever been directly determined by this court. We are referred
to the case of Monroe <em>v.</em> Maples, 1 Root, 553. But no such question
arose in that case. It simply decided that a person convicted of the
crime charged against him could not maintain the action. We are
therefore at liberty to determine the question upon principle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The grounds of this action are, the malice of the defendant, the
want of probable cause, and an injury sustained by the plaintiff.
1 Swift’s Digest, 491. The conviction of the plaintiff is justly considered
as conclusive evidence of probable cause. The authorities referred
to virtually decide—without sufficient reason as it seems to
us—that the termination of the prosecution by a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolle prosequi</span></i>, or
abandonment, was equally conclusive upon that question.</p>

<p class='c007'>One reason given for this is, that no termination of the prosecution
in favor of the accused short of an acquittal will discharge the crime
or be a bar to a new indictment. This reasoning is not satisfactory.
The possibility that the plaintiff may be again prosecuted for the same
alleged offence is not inconsistent with an entire want of probable
cause in the first prosecution. This reason seems to have been disregarded
in Sayles <em>v.</em> Briggs, 4 Met. 421. The complainant abandoned
the prosecution against the plaintiff after a trial, and the magistrate,
who could only bind over or discharge the person accused, discharged
him. The court held that the action could be maintained. Yet such
a discharge could be no bar to a subsequent prosecution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another reason given is, that the common law will not favor actions
in behalf of a party criminally prosecuted against one who has acted
as complainant in behalf of the public, and ostensibly for the public
good; it therefore requires that the plaintiff in such an action shall
begin by offering the verdict of a jury who have considered the cause
on its merits. This may be a very proper caution to a jury, and a
matter which ought to be considered by them in weighing evidence,
but we see no sufficient reason for adopting it as an absolute rule of
law, the effect of which is, in some cases at least, to shut out the
truth. No such rule has been adopted in this State, and we think it is
contrary to the prevailing notions of the profession. Judge Swift, in
his Digest, vol. 1, p. 491, states five different modes of terminating a
prosecution in favor of the accused which will lay the foundation for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>this action, and one of them is, “when the prosecution has been
abandoned and given up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Parker <em>v.</em> Farley, 10 Cush. 279, Shaw, C. J., in speaking of the
rule under consideration, says: “Were this a new and original question,
to be decided upon principle, it might be doubted whether it
would be just and wise to establish this as an inflexible rule of
practice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the whole we think it wise and safe, when a prosecution has
been abandoned, as this was, without any arrangement with the accused,
and without any request from him that it should be so abandoned,
to leave the question of probable cause to the jury.</p>

<p class='c007'>The charge of the court was in harmony with these views, and we
do not advise a new trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this opinion the other judges concurred.<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c015'><sup>[381]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><em>By the Court</em>, <span class='sc'>Bronson, C. J.</span><a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c015'><sup>[382]</sup></a> There was evidence enough in the
case to warrant the jury in finding, that the defendant set the prosecution
in motion from a bad motive. But all the books agree, that proof
of express malice is not enough, without showing also the want of
probable cause. Probable cause has been defined, a reasonable ground
of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves
to warrant a cautious man in the belief, that the person accused
is guilty of the offence with which he is charged. Munns <em>v.</em> Nemours,
3 Wash. C. C. 37. However innocent the plaintiff may have been of
the crime laid to his charge, it is enough for the defendant to show,
that he had reasonable grounds for believing him guilty at the time
the charge was made. In Swain <em>v.</em> Stafford, 3 Iredell, N. C. 289, and
4 id. 392, the action was brought against the defendant, who was a
merchant, for charging the plaintiff with stealing a piece of ribbon
from his store. At the time the complaint was made, the defendant
had received such information as induced a belief of the plaintiff’s
guilt; and although it afterwards turned out that the property had
not been taken by any one, and was never out of the defendant’s possession,
it was held that an action for malicious prosecution could
not be supported. The doctrine that probable cause depends on the
knowledge or information which the prosecutor had at the time the
charge was made, has been carried to a great length. In Delegal <em>v.</em>
Highley, 3 Bing. N. C. 950, which was an action for maliciously, and
without probable cause, procuring a third person to charge the plaintiff
with a criminal offence, the defendant pleaded specially, showing
that the plaintiff was guilty of the offence which had been laid to his
charge; and the plea was held bad in substance, because it did not
show that the defendant, at the time the charge was made, had been
informed, or knew the facts on which the charge rested. The question
of probable cause does not turn on the actual guilt or innocence of the
accused; but upon the belief of the prosecutor concerning such guilt
or innocence. Seibert <em>v.</em> Price, 5 Watts &amp; Serg. 438.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without going into a particular examination of the evidence in this
case, it is enough to say that the defendant, at the time he went before
the grand jury had strong grounds for believing that the plaintiff had
stolen the cattle: and, so far as appears, not a single fact had then
come to his knowledge which was calculated to induce a different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span>opinion. Although the plaintiff was in fact innocent, there would be
no color for this action, if it were not for the fact that the defendant
settled the matter with the plaintiff, instead of proceeding against him
for the supposed offence. If the parties intended the settlement should
extend so far as to cover up and prevent a criminal prosecution, the
defendant was guilty of compounding a felony. And the fact that he
made no complaint until the plaintiff commenced the two suits against
him, goes far to show that he was obnoxious to that charge; and that
he was governed more by his own interest, than by a proper regard to
the cause of public justice. But however culpable the defendant may
have been for neglecting his duty to the public, that cannot be made
the foundation of a private action by the plaintiff. Although the
defendant may have agreed not to prosecute, and the complaint may
have been afterwards made from a malicious feeling towards the plaintiff,
still the fact of probable cause remains; and so long as it exists,
it is a complete defence. There is enough in the defendant’s conduct
to induce a rigid scrutiny of the defence. But if upon such scrutiny
it appear, that he had reasonable grounds for believing the plaintiff
guilty, and there is nothing to show that he did not actually entertain
that belief, there is no principle upon which the action can be
supported.</p>

<p class='c007'>On a careful examination of the case, I am of opinion that the verdict
was clearly wrong. But as the charge of the judge is not given,
we must presume that the case was properly submitted to the jury;
and a new trial can therefore only be had on payment of costs.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Shaw, C. J.</span><a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c015'><sup>[384]</sup></a> In an action for a malicious prosecution against one,
in the name of the Commonwealth, the averment on the part of the
plaintiff, that the complaint was made without reasonable cause, lies
at the foundation of the suit; and although it is in form a negative
proposition, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to establish it by satisfactory
proof. This kind of suit, by which the complainant in a criminal
prosecution is made liable to an action for damages, at the suit of the
person complained of, is not to be favored; it has a tendency to deter
men who know of breaches of the law, from prosecuting offenders,
thereby endangering the order and peace of the community. Absence
of probable cause is essential; from want of probable cause, malice
may be inferred; but from malice, even if express, want of probable
cause cannot be inferred.</p>

<p class='c007'>An ultimate acquittal of the offence charged, though necessary to
be proved, is but a short step towards the maintenance of an action
for malicious prosecution. Malice, and absence of any reasonable and
probable cause, must also concur with an acquittal.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present case, the prosecution complained of was a complaint
before a justice of the peace by whom the plaintiff was convicted;
from this judgment he appealed, and on trial in the Court of Common
Pleas was acquitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the trial, it appeared from the pleadings and evidence, and was
admitted, that the complaint was for an offence which the magistrate
had, by law, jurisdiction to hear, decide and render a judgment in;
also, that neither in the trial before the magistrate, nor in the trial in
the Common Pleas, was the defendant a witness. On this case, the
court ruled that such a conviction was proof of probable cause; or, to
state the proposition with more precision, it negatived the plaintiff’s
leading and essential averment that the complaint was made without
reasonable and probable cause, and that, for this reason, the action
could not be maintained, and thereupon ordered a nonsuit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court are of opinion that this direction was right. The question
of reasonable and probable cause, when the facts are not contested,
is a question of law. And when the plaintiff had been convicted
by a tribunal, constituted by law, with authority to render a judgment,
which, if not appealed from, would have been conclusive of his
guilt, and such judgment is not impeached on the ground of fraud,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>conspiracy or subornation in its procurement, although afterwards
reversed on another trial, it constitutes sufficient proof that the prosecution
was not groundless, and to defeat an action for malicious prosecution.
The case of Whitney <em>v.</em> Peckham, 15 Mass. 243, is directly
in point, and we think it is well sustained by authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said that the question of probable cause is a mixed question
of law and fact, and that the facts should have been left to the jury.
Here no fact material to the question was controverted, and then
there was nothing to leave to a jury.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>This was an action for a malicious arrest: plea not guilty. At the
trial before Abbott, C. J., at the London sittings after last Hilary
term, the jury was directed to find a verdict for the defendant, if they
were of opinion that, at the time when the arrest was made, Mackintosh
acted truly and sincerely upon the faith of the opinion given by
his professional adviser, actually believing that Ravenga was personally
liable, and that he might be lawfully arrested, and that he (Mackintosh)
could recover in that action; but to find for the plaintiff, if
they were of opinion that Mackintosh believed that he must fail in
the action, and that he intended to use the opinion as a protection, in
case the proceedings were afterwards called in question; and that he
made the arrest, not with a view of obtaining his debt, but to compel
the plaintiff to sanction the debentures. The jury found a verdict for
the plaintiff, with £250 damages.<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c015'><sup>[386]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Attorney-General</em> now moved for a new trial.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bayley, J.</span> I have no doubt that in this case there was a want of
probable cause. I accede to the proposition, that if a party lays all
the facts of his case fairly before counsel, and acts <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> upon the
opinion given by that counsel (however erroneous that opinion may
be), he is not liable to an action of this description.<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c015'><sup>[387]</sup></a> A party, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_635'>635</span>may take the opinions of six different persons, of which three
are one way and three another. It is therefore a question for the
jury, whether he acted <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> on the opinion, believing that he had
a cause of action. The jury in this case have found, and there was
abundant evidence to justify them in drawing the conclusion, that the
defendant did not act <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>, and that he did not believe that he
had any cause of action whatever. Assuming that the defendant’s
belief that he had a cause of action would amount to a probable cause,
still, after the jury have found that he did not believe that he had
any cause of action whatever, the judge would have been bound to
say, that he had not reasonable or probable cause of action.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>This was an action on the case for a malicious arrest.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial, before Taunton, J., at the last Summer Assizes for the
county of Devon, it appeared, that the plaintiff was indebted to the
defendant in the sum of £45, for one year’s composition of tithe; and
that the sum of £16 5<em>s.</em> was due to the plaintiff from the defendant;
that the defendant, under the advice of his attorney, arrested the
plaintiff for the whole sum of £45, instead of for the balance, after
deducting the sum of £16 5<em>s.</em> The defendant, on finding out that he
was mistaken in point of law, and that he should only have arrested
for the balance, discontinued the action.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no evidence at all of malice in fact; but the learned judge
told the jury, that, as the plaintiff ought not, by law, to have been
arrested for more than the balance, the law implied malice; and that
the only question for their consideration was, the amount of damages;
upon which a verdict was found for the plaintiff for £20.</p>

<p class='c007'>A rule had been obtained, in a former term, calling on the plaintiff
to show cause why that verdict should not be set aside, and a new trial
had;<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c015'><sup>[389]</sup></a> against which—</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Follett</em> now showed cause.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Coleridge</em>, Serjt., and <em>Bere</em>, contra.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Denman, C. J.</span> Every arrest by a creditor for more than is due, is,
in some sense, a wrongful act. By statute, if it be made without reasonable
or probable cause, though with an entire absence of malice,
the party arresting may be deprived of his costs, and at common law,
if the party arrested has suffered damage to a greater extent than those
costs, he may, if the arrest was also made maliciously, bring his action
on the case. In that action, however, it is still incumbent on the
plaintiff to allege and to prove malice as an independent fact; though
it may in some instances be fairly inferred by the jury from the arrest
itself, and the circumstances under which it is made, without any other
proof. They, however, are to decide, as a matter of fact, whether there
be malice or not. I have always understood the question of reasonable
or probable cause on the facts found to be a question for the opinion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_637'>637</span>of the court, and malice to be altogether a question for the jury.<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c015'><sup>[390]</sup></a> Here,
the question of malice having been wholly withdrawn from the consideration
of the jury, there ought to be a new trial.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Parke, J.</span> I am also of opinion that there ought to be a new trial,
on the ground that the learned judge withdrew altogether from the
consideration of the jury the question of malice. I have always understood,
since the case of Johnstone <em>v.</em> Sutton, 1 T. R. 510, which was
decided long before I was in the profession, that no point of law was
more clearly settled than that in every action for a malicious prosecution
or arrest, the plaintiff must prove what is averred in the declaration,
viz. that the prosecution or arrest was malicious and without
reasonable or probable cause: if there be reasonable or probable cause,
no malice, however distinctly proved, will make the defendant liable;
but when there is no reasonable or probable cause, it is for the jury to
infer malice from the facts proved. That is a question in all cases for
their consideration, and it having in this instance been withdrawn
from them, it is impossible to say whether they might or might not
have come to the conclusion that the arrest was malicious. It was
for them to decide it, and not for the judge. I can conceive a case
where there are mutual accounts between parties, and where an arrest
for the whole sum claimed by the plaintiff would not be malicious; for
example, the plaintiff might know that the set-off was open to dispute,
and that there was reasonable ground for disputing it. In that case,
though it might afterwards appear that the set-off did exist, the arrest
would not be malicious. The term “malice” in this form of action
is not to be considered in the sense of spite or hatred against an individual,
but of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">malus animus</span></i>, and as denoting that the party is actuated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_638'>638</span>by improper and indirect motives.<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c015'><sup>[391]</sup></a> That would not be the case
where, there being an unsettled account, with items on both sides, one
of the parties, believing <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> that a certain sum was due to him,
arrested his debtor for that sum, though it afterwards appeared that
a less sum was due; nor where a party made such an arrest, acting
<i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> under a wrong notion of the law and pursuant to legal
advice. The question of malice having in this case been wholly withdrawn
from the jury, I think the rule for a new trial must be made
absolute.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Case for maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause
indicting the plaintiff for perjury. Averment that the plaintiff was
tried and acquitted, and judgment given that he should depart without
day, as by record appeared, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plea, by Heslop: Not guilty. Issue thereon.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the trial, before Wightman, J., at the Durham Summer Assizes,
1847, it was shown, on the part of the plaintiff, that the now defendant
Heslop received the account of Haddrick’s evidence from another
party, and then stated that he would indict Haddrick for perjury;
and that his informant thereupon expressed an opinion that there was
no ground for such indictment; on which Heslop said that, even if
there were not sufficient grounds for the indictment, it would tie up
the mouths of Hinde and Haddrick for a time, and that he would
move for a new trial. No witnesses were called for the defence. The
learned judge asked the jury whether Heslop believed that there was
reasonable ground for indicting, and whether he had indicted from
malice. The jury answered that Heslop did not so believe; and, as
to the malice, they said that they thought that the word “malice”
was strong, but that they thought the defendant had indicted from an
improper motive. The learned judge then decided that the indictment
was without reasonable or probable cause, and told the jury that they
might infer malice from the improper motive. Verdict for the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Michaelmas term (November 5th), 1847,</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Bliss</em> moved for a new trial, on the grounds of misdirection.<a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c015'><sup>[393]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>First: the question of the defendant’s belief ought not to have been
left to the jury. It is for the judge to decide whether there was reasonable
and probable cause. It is true that he may, in order to decide
this, obtain the opinion of the jury upon facts which, when found, he
himself is to act upon in deciding as to the reasonableness and probability.
But belief is not such a fact: it is material as to the malice,
but there may well exist reasonable and probable cause constituted
by facts from which the defendant has wrongly drawn an inference
of want of cause. It is otherwise where the belief becomes material
as an ingredient in the question of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mala fides</span></i>: that was the case in
Ravenga <em>v.</em> Mackintosh, where the defendant rested his defence upon
the ground that he had acted <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> on a legal opinion, and the jury
found that he had not so acted. Nothing should be left to the jury
but “the truth of the facts proved, and the justice of the inferences
to be drawn from such facts;” and it is only as affecting those questions
that the belief of the party is material.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_640'>640</span>Next: the jury were misdirected as to malice. The mere fact that
the defendant had an indirect motive, however improper, in instituting
the prosecution does not show malice. The malice required in this
action is express malice in fact, not mere malice in law. In the judgment
of Lords Mansfield and Loughborough, in Johnstone <em>v.</em> Sutton,<a id='r394'></a><a href='#f394' class='c015'><sup>[394]</sup></a>
it is said:<a id='r395'></a><a href='#f395' class='c015'><sup>[395]</sup></a> “From the want of probable cause, malice may be, and
most commonly is, implied. The knowledge of the defendant is also
implied.” The jury ought therefore to have been told that the indirect
motive was quite consistent with absence of malice, unless the defendant
knew (not simply believed) that there was no probable cause,
or unless there was some evidence of express malice towards the
plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Denman, C. J.</span> It would be quite outrageous if, where a party
is proved to believe that a charge is unfounded, it were to be held
that he could have reasonable and probable cause. Reference has been
made to Turner <em>v.</em> Ambler, 10 Q. B. 252, where there was an allusion
to a decision of my Brother Maule, upheld afterwards in the Common
Pleas,<a id='r396'></a><a href='#f396' class='c015'><sup>[396]</sup></a> to the effect that reasonable and probable cause cannot exist
without belief. There may possibly be some difficulty in distinguishing
the case last mentioned from some others: but I think that belief
is essential to the existence of reasonable and probable cause: I do not
mean abstract belief, but a belief upon which a party acts. Where
there is no such belief, to hold that the party had reasonable and probable
cause would be destructive of common sense.<a id='r397'></a><a href='#f397' class='c015'><sup>[397]</sup></a> Proof of the
absence of belief is almost always involved in the proof of malice. In
Turner <em>v.</em> Ambler there was no point directly made at the trial as to
want of belief: the only question was whether the facts of themselves
bore out the probability and reasonableness. But, where a plaintiff
takes upon himself to prove that, assuming the facts to be as the defendant
contends, still the defendant did not believe them, we ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_641'>641</span>not to entertain any doubt that it is proper to leave the question of
belief as a fact to the jury. It is not absolutely necessary that this
belief should be the motive on which he acted: he may act from
malice, and yet, if there was reasonable and probable cause in which
he believed, the case against him must fail.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>VANDERBILT <em>v.</em> MATHIS<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, City of New York, February, 1856.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 5 Duer, 304.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'><em>By the Court</em>, <span class='sc'>Bosworth, J.</span><a id='r398'></a><a href='#f398' class='c015'><sup>[398]</sup></a>—To maintain an action for malicious
prosecution, three facts, if controverted, must be established:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. That the prosecution is at an end, and was determined in favor
of the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The want of probable cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Malice.</p>

<p class='c007'>In such an action, it is necessary to give some evidence of the want
of probable cause. It is insufficient to prove a mere acquittal; that,
alone, is not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> evidence of the want of probable cause.
Gorton <em>v.</em> De Angelis, 6 Wend. 418.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is equally essential, that the former prosecution should appear to
have been maliciously instituted. Malice may be inferred from the
want of probable cause, but such an inference is one which a jury is
not required to make, at all events, merely because they may find the
absence of probable cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unless the evidence, in relation to the circumstances under which
the prosecution was ended, and that given to establish the want of
probable cause, justify the inference of malice, other evidence, in support
of it, must be given.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidence as to the conduct of the defendant, in the course of the
transaction, his declarations on the subject, and any forwardness and
activity in exposing the plaintiff by a publication, are properly admitted
to prove malice. Such evidence must be given as will justify
a jury in finding the existence of malice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rule is uniformly stated, that, to maintain an action, for a
former prosecution, it must be shown to have been without probable
cause, and malicious. Vanduzer <em>v.</em> Linderman, 10 J. R. 110; Murray
<em>v.</em> Long, 1 Wend. 140; 2d Stark. Ev. 494; Willans <em>v.</em> Taylor, 6 Bing.
183.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge, at the trial, charged, that the fact, that the plaintiff was
discharged before the magistrate showed, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i>, that there was
no probable cause for the arrest, and shifted the burden of proof from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_642'>642</span>the plaintiff to the defendant, who was bound to show, affirmatively,
that there was probable cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was requested to charge, “that the discharge of Vanderbilt was
not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> evidence of the want of probable cause.” This he
refused to do. To this refusal to charge, and to the charge as made,
the defendant excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>He also charged, “that, if probable cause is made out, the question
of malice becomes immaterial, except as bearing on the question of
damages.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This question of malice, in fact, supposing that probable cause did
not exist, is material only as affecting the question of damages.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was requested to charge, “that the jury could not find a verdict
for the plaintiff, unless he has proved that there was no probable cause
for the complaint, and not even then, unless they believed, from the
evidence, that, in making the complaint, the defendant acted from
malicious motives.” This the judge declined to do, and to his refusal
to so charge the defendant excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the evidence which establishes the want of probable cause
may be, and generally is, such as to justify the inference of malice, yet
we understand the rule to be, that when it is a just and proper inference
from all the facts and circumstances of the case, upon all the
evidence given in the cause, “that the defendant was not actuated by
any improper motives, but only from an honest desire to being a supposed
offender to justice, the action will not lie, because such facts and
circumstances disprove that which is of the essence of the action, viz.,
the malice of the defendant in pressing the charge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Bulkley <em>v.</em> Smith, 2 Duer, 271, the court stated the rule to be,
“that, in order to maintain a suit for a malicious prosecution, the
plaintiff is bound to prove the entire want of a probable cause for the
accusation, and the actual malice of the defendant in making it.
Malice is a question of fact, which, when the case turns upon it, must
be decided by the jury.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Story, J., in Wiggin <em>v.</em> Coffin, instructed the jury that two things
must concur, to entitle a plaintiff to recover in such an action: “The
first is, the want of probable cause for the prosecution; the second is,
malice in the defendant in carrying on the prosecution. If either
ground fail, there is an end of the suit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Vanduzer <em>v.</em> Linderman, 10 J. R. 110, the court said: “No action
lies, merely for bringing a suit against a person without sufficient
ground. To maintain a suit for a former prosecution, it must appear
to have been without cause, and malicious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If the charge must be understood to mean, that if the want of probable
cause was established, the plaintiff was entitled to recover, although
the jury should believe, from the whole evidence, that, in
making the complaint, the defendant did not act from malicious motives,
then we deem it to be erroneous. This construction is the only
one, of which the language of the instruction appears to be susceptible;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_643'>643</span>for the judge, in charging the jury stated that the “question of malice
in fact, supposing that probable cause did not exist, is material only
as affecting the question of damages.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Malice in fact, is that kind of malice which is to be proved. When
malice may be, and is inferred, from the want of probable cause, it is
actual malice which is thus proved.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no theoretical malice which can satisfy this rule, and which
can coexist with the established fact, that the prosecution was instituted
in an honest belief of the plaintiff’s guilt, and with no other
motives than to bring a supposed offender to justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question of malice may be a turning-point of the controversy,
in an action of this nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The want of probable cause may be shown, and yet upon the whole
evidence, in any given case, it may be a fair question for the determination
of a jury, whether the defendant was actuated by malice.
If the whole evidence is such, that a jury cannot properly doubt the
honesty and purity of the motive which induced the former prosecution,
and if they fully believe that it was instituted from good motives,
and in the sincere conviction that the plaintiff was guilty of the offence
charged, and without malice, the defendant would be entitled to a
verdict.</p>

<p class='c007'>The charge made, and which was excepted to, must be deemed to
have been made, to give the jury a rule of action, in disposing of the
case upon the whole evidence. We think it was not only calculated
to mislead, but was erroneous.</p>

<p class='c007'>A new trial must be granted, with costs to abide the event.<a id='r399'></a><a href='#f399' class='c015'><sup>[399]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Montgomery, J.</span><a id='r400'></a><a href='#f400' class='c015'><sup>[400]</sup></a> The court also ruled throughout the case that in
this action the defendant was not at liberty to prove that the plaintiff
was in fact guilty of the criminal offence imputed to him in the prosecution
instituted by the defendant. It is well established by authority
that in an action for malicious prosecution it is a complete defence
to show that the plaintiff was in fact guilty of the offence charged
against him by defendant, and this though the proof of guilt is furnished
by evidence not known to defendant when the prosecution
against the plaintiff was instituted. This testimony is not in such
case offered in support of probable cause, but to show that the plaintiff
has suffered no wrong by his arrest. The law considers that, if a
criminal is fortunate enough to escape conviction, he should rest content
with his good luck, and not belabor one who suspected his guilt
and acted accordingly. As was said in Newton <em>v.</em> Weaver, 13 R. I.
617:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The action for malicious prosecution was designed for the benefit
of the innocent, and not of the guilty. It matters not whether there

<em>Whitaker</em> and Serjeant <em>Nares</em> for the plaintiff; and in this term the
Lord Chief Justice gave the opinion of the whole court, that judgment
must be for the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Chief Justice.</span> Upon the arguing of this case, the first
objection was, that this action will not lie, there being a remedy given
by statute, that a proceeding on a commission of bankruptcy, was a
proceeding in nature of a civil suit; and that no action of this sort was
ever brought: but we are all of opinion that this action is maintainable.<a id='r402'></a><a href='#f402' class='c015'><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The general grounds of this action are, that the commission was
falsely and maliciously sued out, that the plaintiff has been greatly
damaged thereby, scandalized upon record, and put to great charges
in obtaining a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supersedeas</span></i> to the commission; here is falsehood and
malice in the defendant, and great wrong and damage done to the
plaintiff thereby. Now, wherever there is an injury done to a man’s
property by a false and malicious prosecution, it is most reasonable
he should have an action to repair himself. See 5 Mod. 407, 8;
10 Mod. 218; 12 Mod. 210. I take these to be two leading cases, and
it is dangerous to alter the law. See also 12 Mod. 273; 7 Rep. Bulwer’s
case, 1. 2 Leon. —— 1 Ro. Abr. 101; 1 Ven. 86; 1 Sid. 464.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_646'>646</span>But it is said this action was never brought; and so it was said in
Ashby and White; I wish never to hear this objection again. This
action is for a tort; torts are infinitely various, not limited or confined,
for there is nothing in nature but may be an instrument of
mischief, and this of suing out a commission of bankruptcy falsely
and maliciously, is of the most injurious consequence in a trading
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is further said the stat. 5 Geo. 2, has given a remedy, and therefore
this action will not lie; but we are all of opinion, that in this
case the plaintiff would have been entitled to this remedy by action at
common law, if this Act had never been made, and that the statute
being in the affirmative, hath not taken away the remedy at law.
2 Raym. 163. And this is a universal rule, that an affirmative statute
is hardly ever repealed by a subsequent affirmative statute, for if it is
possible to reconcile two statutes they shall both stand together; if
they cannot be reconciled, the last shall be a repeal of the first; but
the most decisive answer is, that this statute-remedy is a most inadequate
and uncertain remedy; for though there be the most outrageous
malice and perjury, and the party injured suffer to the amount of ten
or twenty thousand pounds, yet the Chancellor has no power to give
him more than the penalty of £200; besides, the method of applying
to the Chancellor, is more tedious, expensive, and inconvenient than
this common law remedy, and this case in its nature is more properly
the province of a jury, than of any judge whatever.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is further objected, that in the third count there is no averment
that the plaintiff was not indebted to the defendant, or ever committed
an act of bankruptcy; but no case was cited to show such averment to
be necessary; the ground and substance of the declaration is falsehood
and malice; there are no instances of such averments in conspiracy,
that the party was innocent, or did not do the fact on which he was
indicted, but the precedents are the other way. In an action for
words, as for saying a man is a thief, the plaintiff has no occasion to
aver he is not a thief, and this case is analogous; for after the plaintiff
has alleged that the commission was false and malicious, it would
be tautology, to make such averment that he was not indebted, &amp;c.,
and this declaration would have been good on a demurrer; more
clearly it is so, after a verdict.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>TOMLINSON <em>v.</em> WARNER<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Ohio, December, 1839.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 9 Ohio Reports, 104.</em></h4>

<p class='c022'>Malicious prosecution. From Licking. The plaintiffs declared that they
were residents of the town of Newark, and possessed of a large amount of
personal property, deposited in a warehouse to be forwarded to New York, for
a market; and that the defendant well knowing the premises, and that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_647'>647</span>plaintiffs had not absconded, but contriving and maliciously intending wrongfully
to injure them, made oath before a justice of the peace, that they had
absconded to the injury of their creditors, as he verily believed, and thereupon
sued out of the Court of Common Pleas, a writ of attachment, and
caused the said property to be seized by the sheriff, and held for a long time,
whereby the same was injured, the plaintiffs deprived of the opportunity of
forwarding their goods to a market, and greatly injured. Plea, not guilty.</p>

<p class='c019'>Upon trial to the jury, the counsel for the plaintiffs admitted that the
plaintiffs were indebted to the defendant at the time of his affidavit, as sworn
to in it; whereupon the court directed a nonsuit, with leave to move to open
it, and for a new trial, which is now made.<a id='r403'></a><a href='#f403' class='c015'><sup>[403]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>By the Court, <span class='sc'>Wood, J.</span> The only question presented in this motion, is, do
the facts set forth in the declaration constitute a legal cause of action, provided
the plaintiffs were indebted to the defendant, when he sued out the writ
of attachment?</p>

<p class='c019'>In Connecticut, there is a statute which provides, that where a plaintiff
shall “willingly and wittingly” wrong any defendant by prosecuting any action
against him with intent wrongfully to trouble and vex him, such plaintiff
shall pay treble damages for the first offence, be liable to a fine for the second,
and for the third, may be proceeded against as a common barrator. Judge
Swift thinks the act founded in the clearest principles of justice. Swift Dig.
493. At common law, it seems well settled, that no action will lie for a malicious
prosecution of a civil suit, without cause, where there is no arrest.
I Salk. R. 14. The costs allowed in all other cases are supposed to be a sufficient
compensation for the injury, however malicious. The rule itself may
perhaps be admitted, but the reason on which it is said to be founded cannot
be so readily admitted, for at common law no costs were allowed. If the
plaintiff failed, he was amerced for his false clamor, and if he succeeded, the
defendant was at the mercy of the King. But at common law, whenever there
was an arrest, holding to bail, or imprisonment, where no debt was due, or
for a greater sum than was due, with a malicious intention to injure, the
action lay for a malicious arrest. 1 Saund. R. 228. The action for a malicious
prosecution, which technically only applies to cases of malicious prosecution
of criminal complaints, lies as well where there is not, as where there is an
arrest; and the grounds of the action are the malice of the defendant, want
of probable cause, and injury to the plaintiff’s person by imprisonment, his
reputation by scandal, or to his property by expense. 1 Swift Dig. 491. Having
no direct adjudication on the question before us, we may look to the
analogies of the law. The counsel for the defendant insist that because the
plaintiffs’ indebtedness to the defendant in the former suit is admitted, there
was probable cause for suing out the writ of attachment. This does not seem
to us to follow. To constitute probable cause for suing out a writ of attachment,
the law requires an affidavit of indebtedness, and also that the debtor
has absconded, or is non-resident. The absence of either is absence of probable
cause for the writ, and the false affirmation of either fact, knowingly, as
a means of procuring the writ, shows express malice, whilst the taking of
property without cause is a sufficient injury to sustain the action.</p>

<p class='c019'>In the Supreme Court of New York, it has been decided, that case would
lie against both plaintiff and defendant, for fraudulently setting up the judgment
as unsatisfied, when in fact paid, and causing an execution and sale of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_648'>648</span>land once held by it as a lien, but which had been afterwards conveyed by the
defendant to a third person. The court in that case say, “If it appear that
the unlawful acts of the defendant occasioned trouble, inconvenience, or expense
to the plaintiff, this action lies.” The general rule is, that for every
injury the law gives redress; and it would be a reproach to the administration
of justice, if one, by perjury, could take from another the control of
his property, under form of law, and the law afford no remedy. Nice technicalities
are sometimes applied to get rid of a hard case; but when, under
form of law, opportunity is sought to gratify malice, to the injury of another,
courts will not be astute to avoid, but rather seek ground to sustain an action.
We have no facts in this case, before us, but the statement in the
declaration, and the admission of indebtedness; but these show a sufficient
prima facie cause of action, and cause for opening up the nonsuit.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Beck, J.</span><a id='r405'></a><a href='#f405' class='c015'><sup>[405]</sup></a> The petition alleges that defendants brought an action
against plaintiff and his wife, charging in the petition that they two
conspired and confederated together to defraud defendants, by representing
to defendants, under the assumed name of Baker, that they
were the owners of certain lands in Poweshiek County, which defendants
were induced to purchase of plaintiff and his wife, who, in such
assumed name, executed to defendants a warranty deed therefor; that,
in an action by one Woodward, a deed, purporting to be executed by
him to the Bakers, under which they claimed title to the lands, was
declared to be void, for the reason that it was forged and fraudulent,
and that plaintiff herein and his wife well knew the condition of their
title, and representing that they were the owners thereof, for the purpose
of cheating defendants, and of obtaining money by false and
fraudulent pretences, and did, in that manner, obtain the sum of
$3,000 from defendants. It is further alleged that defendants herein
served out a writ of attachment in the suit brought by them, which
was levied upon real estate owned by plaintiff’s wife, and that defendants
for a time prosecuted their action, but finally dismissed it
at their own costs. Plaintiff, in his petition in this case, alleges that
he was not indebted to defendants in any sum at the time their action
was brought against him; that he was not guilty of the frauds therein
charged, and that the action was commenced and prosecuted by defendants
maliciously and without probable cause. The defendants,
in their answer, admit the commencement of the suit, the issuing of
the attachment, and that it was levied upon real estate owned by
plaintiff’s wife. There was no evidence showing, or tending to show,
that the writ of attachment was levied upon any property owned by
plaintiff. The wife of plaintiff does not join in this action.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think the doctrine is well established by the great preponderance
of authority that no action will lie for the institution and prosecution
of a civil action with malice and without probable cause, where
there has been no arrest of the person or seizure of the property of
defendant, and no special injury sustained, which would not necessarily
result in all suits prosecuted to recover for like causes of action.</p>

<p class='c007'>See 1 Am. Leading Cases, p. 218, note to Munn <em>v.</em> Dupont <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et al.</span></i>,
and cases there cited; Mayer <em>v.</em> Walter, 64 Pa. St. 289; Kramer <em>v.</em>

Frambes, Id. 156; Potts <em>v.</em> Imlay, 4 N. J. L. 330 (1 South.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_650'>650</span>This doctrine is supported by the following considerations: The
courts are open and free to all who have grievances and seek remedies
therefor, and there should be no restraint upon a suitor, through fear
of liability resulting from failure in his action, which would keep him
from the courts. He ought not, in ordinary cases, to be subject to a
suit for bringing an action, and be required to defend against the
charge of malice and the want of probable cause. If an action may
be maintained against a plaintiff for the malicious prosecution of a
suit without probable cause, why should not a right of action accrue
against a defendant who defends without probable cause and with
malice? The doctrine surely tends to discourage vexatious litigation,
rather than to promote it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be observed that the statement of the doctrine we have made
extends it no farther than to cases prosecuted in the usual manner,
where defendants suffer no special damages or grievance other than is
endured by all defendants in suits brought upon like causes of action.
If the bringing of the action operates to disturb the peace, to impose
care and expense, or even to cast discredit and suspicion upon the defendant,
the same results follow all actions of like character, whether
they be meritorious, or prosecuted maliciously and without probable
cause. They are incidents of litigation. But if an action is so prosecuted
as to entail unusual hardship upon the defendant, and subject
him to special loss of property or of reputation, he ought to be compensated.
So, if his property be seized, or if he be subjected to arrest
by an action maliciously prosecuted, the law secures to him a remedy.
In the case at bar, the pleadings and evidence show no such special
damages. No action could be prosecuted to recover money
fraudulently obtained, in which the defendant would not suffer the
very things for which plaintiff in this case seeks compensation in
damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Counsel for plaintiff, in support of their position that the action may
be maintained, though no arrest of defendant or seizure of property
be had in the proceeding alleged to have been maliciously prosecuted,
cite Green <em>v.</em> Cochran, 43 Iowa, 544, and Moffatt <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et al.</span></i> <em>v.</em> Fisher,
47 Id. 473. In the first case, the action alleged to be malicious was
a proceeding for bastardy, which, under the statute, operated as a
lien upon defendant’s lands from the commencement. In the other
case, the action which was the foundation of plaintiff’s claim was
forcible entry and detainer, and, before final disposition thereof, the
defendant was ousted of possession of the land, whereon was a coal
mine. In both instances the property of the respective defendants
was reached by the proceedings. The facts of these cases are not
within the rule we have stated, and do not support counsel’s position.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>Case. The second count of the declaration alleged that the defendant heretofore,
to wit 1st January, 1838, and on divers &amp;c. between that day and 22d
November, 1838, contriving and maliciously intending to injure, harass and
damnify plaintiff, and to put him to great vexation, unlawfully and maliciously
did advise, procure, instigate and stir up John Thomas to commence
and prosecute an action of trespass on the case in the court &amp;c. (Queen’s
Bench) against the now plaintiff; that by and through such advice, procurement,
instigation and stirring-up, John Thomas did in fact afterwards, to wit
4th January, 1838, commence and prosecute the last-mentioned action. The
present declaration then set out three counts of a declaration in case at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_652'>652</span>suit of John Thomas against the defendant, averment of a trial at nisi prius
at Dorchester, on 18th July, 1838, and that the defendant was then and there
acquitted of the premises mentioned to be charged against him by John
Thomas. And thereupon afterwards, to wit 22d November, 1838, it was considered,
in and by the said court &amp;c., amongst other things, that the said
John Thomas be in mercy for his false claim against the now plaintiff defendant
in the said last-mentioned action as aforesaid. Whereby the now
plaintiff was not only put to great trouble and vexation, but was also obliged
to pay, and did in fact pay, a large &amp;c., to wit £800, in and about the defence
of the said action.</p>

<p class='c019'>The defendant pleaded, in effect, that the advice given by him was given in
the character of an attorney.</p>

<p class='c019'>Special demurrer. Joinder.<a id='r407'></a><a href='#f407' class='c015'><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Lord Denman, C. J.</span> The case of Pechell <em>v.</em> Watson, 8 M. &amp; W. 691, proceeded
on the principle that to maintain an action already commenced was
unlawful. That is not here charged; and therefore the count ought to show
the ingredients which make the instigation to a suit actionable. The plaintiff
has not done this; for, beyond all doubt, the absence of reasonable or probable
cause is one such ingredient, in the absence of which it does not appear that
the plaintiff has been unlawfully disturbed.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Patteson, J.</span> I think this declaration is bad, for the reason already given.
The case is analogous to that of a complaint of malicious prosecution or arrest;
and here, as there, the want of reasonable or probable cause ought to be
alleged.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_653'>653</span><span class='sc'>Williams, J.</span> The averments in this declaration might be sustained by
proof that the defendant, not being an attorney, had held a conversation with
Thomas, and had said, “If your story is correct, you might sue Flight.” No
action could be maintained on that, unless it further appeared that the now
defendant knew that there was no right to sue the now plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Coleridge, J.</span> It is not asserted here that the suit maintained was without
reasonable or probable cause: there are only general words, imputing an instigation
and a stirring-up. There should be added to these, in strict analogy
with actions for malicious prosecution or arrest, as my Brother Patteson has
pointed out, an averment of want of reasonable or probable cause: and without
such averment this declaration shows no right of action.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Tindal, C. J.</span><a id='r409'></a><a href='#f409' class='c015'><sup>[409]</sup></a> This is a special action on the case, in which the
plaintiff declares that he was the master and owner of a vessel which,
in September, 1836, he mortgaged to the defendant for the sum of £80,
with a covenant for repayment in September, 1837, and under a stipulation
that, in the mean time, the plaintiff should retain the command
of the vessel, and prosecute voyages therein for his own profit; that
the defendants, in order to compel the plaintiff through duress to give
up the register of the vessel, without which he could not go to sea before
the money lent on mortgage became due, threatened to arrest him
for the same unless he immediately paid the amount; that, upon the
plaintiff refusing to pay it, the defendants, knowing he could not provide
bail, arrested him under a <em>capias</em>, indorsed to levy £95, 17s. 6d.,
and kept him imprisoned, until, by duress, he was compelled to give
up the register, which the defendants then unlawfully detained; by
means whereof the plaintiff lost four voyages from London to Caen.
There is also a count in trover for the register. The defendants
pleaded the general issue; and, after a verdict for the plaintiff, the
case comes before us on a double ground, under an application for a
nonsuit, and in arrest of judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_654'>654</span>The second ground urged for a nonsuit is, that there was no proof
of the suit commenced by the defendants having been terminated. But
the answer to this, and to the objection urged in arrest of judgment,
namely, the omission to allege want of reasonable and probable cause
for the defendants’ proceeding, is the same,—that this is an action for
abusing the process of the law, by applying it to extort property from
the plaintiff, and not an action for a malicious arrest or malicious
prosecution, in order to support which action the termination of the
previous proceeding must be proved, and the absence of reasonable
and probable cause be alleged as well as proved. In the case of a
malicious arrest, the sheriff at least is instructed to pursue the exigency
of the writ; here the directions given, to compel the plaintiff to yield
up the register, were no part of the duty enjoined by the writ. If
the course pursued by the defendants is such that there is no precedent
of a similar transaction, the plaintiff’s remedy is by an action on the
case, applicable to such new and special circumstances; and his complaint
being that the process of the law has been abused, to effect an
object not within the scope of the process, it is immaterial whether
the suit which that process commenced has been determined or not,
or whether or not it was founded on reasonable and probable cause.<a id='r410'></a><a href='#f410' class='c015'><sup>[410]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Hubbard, J.</span><a id='r411'></a><a href='#f411' class='c015'><sup>[411]</sup></a> In the present suit, which is an action on the case against
the defendant for prosecuting a suit in the name of Thomas Bond against the
plaintiff, the plaintiff avers, in his declaration, (which accompanies the exceptions)
that the defendant, without authority from said Thomas, and having
no reasonable ground for believing that anything was due from the plaintiff
to him, attached the plaintiff’s property, and prosecuted said suit against
him, from November term, 1840, to November term, 1841, when he became
nonsuit; and evidence was offered tending to prove these allegations. The
instructions to the jury were, that “the plaintiff must prove the former action
to have been commenced and prosecuted maliciously, that is to say, with some
improper motive, or without due care to ascertain his rights, as well as without
authority, and without probable cause.” The error complained of may
have arisen from not distinguishing, during the trial, between an action on
the case for malicious prosecution, and an action on the case for prosecuting
a suit in the name of a third person, without authority, by reason of which
the defendant sustains injury.</p>

<p class='c019'>In a suit for malicious prosecution, the gist of the action is malice; but
there must also exist the want of probable cause. And without the proof of
both facts, the action cannot be maintained, though the existence of malice
may often be inferred from the want of probable cause. But in an action on
the case for damages for prosecuting a suit against the plaintiff without
authority, in the name of a third person, the gist of the action is not a want
of probable cause,—for there may be a good cause of action,—but for the
improper liberty of using the name of another person in prosecuting a suit,
by which the defendant in the action is injured. Nor is the proof of malice
essential to the maintenance of such action. If the party supposes he has
authority to commence a suit, when in fact he has none, and the nominal
plaintiff does not adopt it, the action fails for want of such authority. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_656'>656</span>such case, though the party supposed he had authority, and acted upon that
supposition, without malice, still if the defendant suffers injury by reason of
the prosecution of the unauthorized suit against him, he may maintain an
action for the actual damages sustained by him, in the loss of time, and for
money paid to procure the discontinuance of the suit, but nothing more.
Where, however, in addition to a want of authority, the suit commenced was
altogether groundless, and was prosecuted with malicious motives—which
may be inferred from there existing no right of action, as well as proved in
other ways—then, in addition to the actual loss of time and money, the party
may recover damages for the injury inflicted on his feelings and reputation.</p>

<p class='c019'>In this case, the learned judge having instructed the jury that a want of
probable cause and malice must concur with the want of authority to commence
the suit in the name of a third person, to enable the plaintiff to maintain
the action, we think there was error in the instruction, and that though
the damages might be enhanced by showing malice and a want of probable
cause, yet that the proof of them is not essential to the maintenance of the
action.</p>

  <h4 class='c013'>SNYDER <em>v.</em> ANDREWS<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New York, March 5, 1849.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 6 Barbour, 43.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This was an action on the case for a libel. The defendant pleaded
the general issue, and gave notice of special matter.<a id='r415'></a><a href='#f415' class='c015'><sup>[415]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The cause was tried at the Saratoga circuit in November, 1847,
before Justice Paige. On the trial the defendant admitted that he
wrote the letter containing the alleged libel, sealed the same, and put
it into the post-office at Saratoga Springs, directed to the plaintiff at
his residence. The plaintiff proved by John R. Brown that the letter
was read to the witness by the defendant at his office in the presence
of a young man who was a clerk of the defendant. The defendant’s
counsel then moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that a publication of
the libel had not been proved. The judge denied the motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff of $250. And the defendant,
upon a bill of exceptions, moved for a new trial.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Willard, J.</span> The fact that the defendant read the letter to a
stranger, before it was sent to the plaintiff, was not questioned on
the trial, and is assumed to be true by the form of the objection; but
it is insisted that such reading did not amount to a publication of the
libel. No man incurs any civil responsibility by what he thinks or
even writes, unless he divulges his thoughts to the temporal prejudice
of another. Hence, a sealed letter containing libellous matter, if
communicated to no one but to the party libelled, is not the foundation
for a civil action, although it may be of an indictment. Lyle <em>v.</em>
Clason, 1 Caines, 581; Hodges <em>v.</em> The State, 5 Humphrey, 112; 1
Wms. Saund. 132, <em>n.</em> 2; Phillips <em>v.</em> Jansen, 2 Esp. 626; 2 Starkie on
Slander (Wend. ed.), 14. But where the defendant, knowing that
letters addressed to the plaintiff were usually opened by and read by
his clerk, wrote a libellous letter and directed it to the plaintiff and
his clerk received and read it, it was held there was a sufficient publication
to support the action. Delacroix <em>v.</em> Thevenot, 2 Stark. 63. And
in Schenck <em>v.</em> Schenck, 1 Spencer, 208, a sealed letter addressed and
delivered to the wife containing a libel on her husband was held a
publication sufficient to enable the latter to sustain an action.<a id='r416'></a><a href='#f416' class='c015'><sup>[416]</sup></a> Reading

59 b; 1 Saund. 132, <em>n.</em> 2. The reading of the letter in question by
the defendant in the presence of Brown was a sufficient publication to
sustain this action.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was an action for a libel and slanderous words. The libel
was contained in a letter directed to plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>A clerk of the plaintiff proved that he had received the letter; that
it was in the handwriting of the defendant; and that in the absence
of the plaintiff he was in the habit of opening letters directed to him
which were not marked “private.” He further stated that defendant,
who was well acquainted with the plaintiff, was aware of the nature
of his (the clerk’s) employment, and that he believed defendant knew
that witness was in the habit of opening plaintiff’s letters.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Ellenborough</span> said that there was sufficient evidence for the
jury to consider whether defendant did not intend the letter to come
to the hands of a third person, which would be a publication.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Bigelow, J.</em><a id='r419'></a><a href='#f419' class='c015'><sup>[419]</sup></a> Proof of the publication of the defamatory words
alleged in the declaration was essential to the maintenance of this
action. Slander consists in uttering words to the injury of a person’s
reputation. No such injury is done when the words are uttered only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_660'>660</span>to the person concerning whom they are spoken, no one else being
present or within hearing. It is damage done to character in the
opinion of other men, and not in a party’s self-estimation, which constitutes
the material element in an action for verbal slander. Even in
a civil action for libel, evidence that the defendant wrote and sent a
sealed letter to the plaintiff, containing defamatory matter, was held
insufficient proof of publication; although it would be otherwise in an
indictment for libel, because such writings tend directly to a breach of
the peace. So, too, it must be shown that the words were spoken in
the presence of some one who understood them. If spoken in a foreign
language, which no one present understood, no action will lie
therefor.<a id='r420'></a><a href='#f420' class='c015'><sup>[420]</sup></a> Edwards <em>v.</em> Wooton, 12 Co. 35; Hick’s Case, Pop. 139,

<p class='c007'>It is quite immaterial in the present case that the words were spoken
in a public place. The real question for the jury was, were they so
spoken as to have been heard by third persons? The defendants were

</div>

<p class='c014'>Case. The declaration stated that the defendant, in the presence
and hearing of divers subjects, falsely and maliciously charged the
plaintiff, a gardener, with being a thief. Plea: Not guilty. At the trial,
before Rolfe, B., it appeared that the words were uttered by the
defendant, a toll collector, to the plaintiff, as he passed the Kingsland
turnpike-gate, in the presence of several persons as well as the witness.
The nature of the previous conversation between the plaintiff and defendant
did not appear. The learned Baron told the jury that it was
immaterial whether the defendant intended to convey a charge of
felony against the plaintiff by the words used, the question being,
whether the by-standers would understand that charge to be conveyed
by them. Verdict for the plaintiff for £5.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Humfrey</em> now moved for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection.<a id='r422'></a><a href='#f422' class='c015'><sup>[422]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Alderson, B.</span> In this case, had there been no by-standers who
could understand the words as imputing felony, or who knew all about
the affair respecting which they were uttered, the judge’s direction
would have been wrong, for it would then be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum absque injuria</span></i>,
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">injuria</span></i> being the having no lawful occasion to impute felony.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Parke, B.</span> The witness appears to have been well acquainted with
the affair to which the words related. If the by-standers were equally
cognizant of it, the defendant would have been entitled to a verdict;
but here the only question is, whether the private intention of a man
who utters injurious words is material, if by-standers may fairly
understand them in a sense and manner injurious to the party to
whom they relate, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</span></i>, that he was a felon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some doubt being suggested as to the facts proved, the court conferred
with Rolfe, B.; and the next day,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pollock, C. B.</span>, said, We find from my Brother Rolfe that there
were several by-standers who not only might but must have heard the
expressions which form the subject of this action. That disposes of
the case as to the matter of law. Words uttered must be construed
in the sense which hearers of common and reasonable understanding
would ascribe to them, even though particular individuals better informed
on the matter alluded to might form a different judgment
on the subject.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Bayley, J.</span>, now delivered the judgment of the court.<a id='r424'></a><a href='#f424' class='c015'><sup>[424]</sup></a> This was an
action for slander. The plaintiffs were bankers at Monmouth, and the
charge was, that in answer to a question from one Lewis Watkins,
whether he, the defendant, had said that the plaintiff’s bank had
stopped, the defendant’s answer was, “It was true, he had been told
so.” The evidence was, that Watkins met defendant and said, “I hear
that you say the bank of Bromage and Snead, at Monmouth, has
stopped. Is it true?” Defendant said, “Yes, it is; I was told so.”
He added, “It was so reported at Crickhowell, and nobody would take
their bills, and that he had come to town in consequence of it himself.”
Watkins said, “You had better take care what you say; you first
brought the news to town, and told Mr. John Thomas of it.” Defendant
repeated, “I was told so.” Defendant had been told, at Crickhowell,
there was a run upon plaintiff’s bank, but not that it had
stopped, or that nobody would take their bills, and what he said went
greatly beyond what he had heard. The learned judge considered the
words as proved, and he does not appear to have treated it as a case
of privileged communication; but as the defendant did not appear
to be actuated by any ill will against the plaintiffs, he told the jury
that if they thought the words were not spoken maliciously, though
they might unfortunately have produced injury to the plaintiffs, the
defendant ought to have their verdict; but if they thought them
spoken maliciously, they should find for the plaintiff: and the jury
having found for the defendant, the question upon a motion for a new
trial was upon the propriety of this direction. If in an ordinary case
of slander (not a case of privileged communication), want of malice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_663'>663</span>is a question of fact for the consideration of a jury, the direction was
right; but if in such a case the law implies such malice as is necessary
to maintain the action, it is the duty of the judge to withdraw the
question of malice from the consideration of the jury: and it appears
to us that the direction in this case was wrong. That malice, in some
sense, is the gist of the action, and that therefore the manner and
occasion of speaking the words is admissible in evidence to show they
were not spoken with malice, is said to have been agreed (either by all
the judges, or at least by the four who thought the truth might be
given in evidence on the general issue) in Smith <em>v.</em> Richardson, Willes,
24; and it is laid down in 1 Com. Dig. action upon the case for defamation,
G 5, that the declaration must show a malicious intent in the
defendant, and there are some other very useful elementary books in
which it is said that malice is the gist of the action, but in what sense
the words malice or malicious intent are here to be understood,
whether in the popular sense, or in the sense the law puts upon those
expressions, none of these authorities state. Malice in common acceptation
means ill-will against a person, but in its legal sense it means
a wrongful act, done intentionally, without just cause or excuse. If
I give a perfect stranger a blow likely to produce death, I do it of
malice, because I do it intentionally and without just cause or excuse.
If I maim cattle, without knowing whose they are; if I poison a
fishery, without knowing the owner, I do it of malice, because it is a
wrongful act, and done intentionally. If I am arraigned of felony,
and wilfully stand mute, I am said to do it of malice, because it is
intentional and without just cause or excuse. Russell on Crimes, 614,
N. 1. And if I traduce a man, whether I know him or not, and
whether I intend to do him an injury or not, I apprehend the law
considers it as done of malice, because it is wrongful and intentional.
It equally works an injury, whether I meant to produce an injury or
not, and if I had no legal excuse for the slander, why is he not to
have a remedy against me for the injury it produces? And I apprehend
the law recognizes the distinction between these two descriptions
of malice, malice in fact and malice in law, in actions of slander.
In an ordinary action for words, it is sufficient to charge that the defendant
spoke them falsely, it is not necessary to state that they were
spoken maliciously. This is so laid down in Style, 392, and was adjudged
upon error in Mercer <em>v.</em> Sparks, Owen, 51; Noy, 35. The
objection there was, that the words were not charged to have been
spoken maliciously, but the court answered, that the words were themselves
malicious and slanderous, and, therefore, the judgment was
affirmed. But in actions for such slander as is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> excusable
on account of the cause of speaking or writing it, as in the case of
servant’s characters, confidential advice, or communications to persons
who ask it, or have a right to expect it, malice in fact must be
proved by the plaintiff, and in Edmonson <em>v.</em> Stevenson, 1 Term Rep.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_664'>664</span>110, Lord Mansfield takes the distinction between these and ordinary
actions of slander. In Weatherstone <em>v.</em> Hawkins, Bull. N. P. 8, where
a master who had given a servant a character, which prevented his
being hired, gave his brother-in-law, who applied to him upon the subject,
a detail by letter of certain instances in which the servant had
defrauded him; Wood, who argued for the plaintiff, insisted that this
case did not differ from the case of common libels, that it had the two
essential ingredients, slander and falsehood; that it was not necessary
to prove express malice; if the matter is slanderous, malice is implied,
it is sufficient to prove publication; the motives of the party publishing
are never gone into, and that the same doctrine held in actions for
words, no express malice need be proved. Lord Mansfield said the
general rules are laid down as Mr. Wood has stated, but to every libel
there may be an implied justification from the occasion. So as to the
words, instead of the plaintiff’s showing it to be false and malicious,
it appears to be incidental to the application by the intended master
for the character; and Buller, J., said, this is an exception to the general
rule, on account of the occasion of writing. In actions of this
kind, the plaintiff must prove the words “malicious” as well as false.
Buller, J., repeats in Pasley <em>v.</em> Freeman, 3 T. R. 61, that for words
spoken confidentially upon advice asked, no action lies, unless express
malice can be proved. So in Hargrave <em>v.</em> Le Breton, 3 Burr. 2425,
Lord Mansfield states that no action can be maintained against a
master for the character he gives a servant, unless there are extraordinary
circumstances of express malice. But in an ordinary action
for a libel or for words, though evidence of malice may be given to
increase the damages, it never is considered as essential, nor is there
any instance of a verdict for a defendant on the ground of want of
malice. Numberless occasions must have occurred (particularly in
cases where a defendant only repeated what he had heard before, but
without naming the author), upon which, if that were a tenable
ground, verdicts would have been sought for and obtained, and the
absence of any such instance is a proof of what has been the general
and universal opinion upon the point. Had it been noticed to the
jury how the defendant came to speak the words, and had it been left
to them as a previous question, whether the defendant understood
Watkins as asking for information for his own guidance, and that
the defendant spoke what he did to Watkins, merely by way of honest
advice to regulate his conduct, the question of malice in fact would
have been proper as a second question to the jury, if their minds were
in favor of the defendant upon the first; but as the previous question
I have mentioned was never put to the jury, but this was treated as
an ordinary case of slander, we are of opinion that the question of
malice ought not to have been left to the jury. It was, however,
pressed upon us with considerable force, that we ought not to grant a
new trial, on the ground that the evidence did not support any of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_665'>665</span>counts in the declaration, but upon carefully attending to the declaration
and the evidence, we think we are not warranted in saying that
there was no evidence to go to the jury to support the declaration;
and had the learned judge intimated an opinion that there was no such
evidence, the plaintiff might have attempted to supply the defect. We,
therefore, think that we cannot properly refuse a new trial, upon the
ground that the result upon the trial might have been doubtful. In
granting a new trial, however, the court does not mean to say that it
may not be proper to put the question of malice as a question of fact
for the consideration of the jury; for if the jury should think that
when Watkins asked his question the defendant understood it as asked
in order to obtain information to regulate his own conduct, it will
range under the cases of privileged communication, and the question
of malice, in fact, will then be a necessary part of the jury’s inquiry;
but it does not appear that it was left to the jury in this case, to consider
whether this was understood by the defendant as an application
to him for advice, and if not, the question of malice was improperly
left to their consideration. We are, therefore, of opinion, that the
rule for a new trial must be absolute.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>HANSON <em>v.</em> GLOBE NEWSPAPER COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, June 20, 1893.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 159 Massachusetts Reports, 293.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Knowlton, J.</span><a id='r426'></a><a href='#f426' class='c015'><sup>[426]</sup></a> The defendant published in its newspaper an
article describing the conduct of a prisoner brought before the Municipal
Court of Boston, and the proceedings of the court in the case,
designating him as “H. P. Hanson, a real estate and insurance broker
of South Boston.” He was, in fact, a real estate and insurance broker
of South Boston, and the article was substantially true, except that
he should have been called A. P. H. Hanson instead of H. P. Hanson.
The plaintiff, H. P. Hanson, is also a real estate and insurance broker
in South Boston, and in writing the article the reporter used his name
by mistake.<a id='r427'></a><a href='#f427' class='c015'><sup>[427]</sup></a> The justice of the Superior Court, before whom the
case was tried, without a jury, “found as a fact that the alleged libel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_666'>666</span>declared on by the plaintiff was not published by the defendant of or
concerning the plaintiff,” and the only question in the case is whether
this finding was erroneous as matter of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>In every action of this kind the fundamental question is, What is
the meaning of the author of the alleged libel or slander, conveyed by
the words used interpreted in the light of all the circumstances? The
reason of this is obvious. Defamatory language is harmful only as it
purports to be the expression of the thought of him who uses it. In
determining the effect of a slander the questions involved are, What
is the thought intended to be expressed, and how much credit should
be given to him who expresses it? The essence of the wrong is the
expression of what purports to be the knowledge or opinion of him
who utters the defamatory words, or of some one else whose language
he repeats. His meaning, to be ascertained in a proper way, is what
gives character to his act, and makes it innocent or wrongful. The
damages depend chiefly upon the weight which is to be given to his
expression of his meaning, and all the questions relate back to the
ascertainment of his meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present case we are concerned only with the meaning of the
defendant in regard to the person to whom the language of the published
article was to be applied, and the question to be decided is, How
may his meaning legitimately be ascertained? Obviously, in the first
place, from the language used; and in construing and applying the
language, the circumstances under which it was written and the facts
to which it relates are to be considered, so far as they can readily be
ascertained by those who read the words, and who attempt to find out
the meaning of the author in regard to the person of whom they were
written. It has often been said that the meaning of the language is
not necessarily that which it may seem to have to those who read it
as strangers, without knowledge of facts and circumstances which
give it color and aid in its interpretation, but that which it has when
read in the light of events which have relation to the utterance or
publication of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the purposes of this case it may be assumed, in favor of the
plaintiff, that if the language used in a particular case, interpreted in
the light of such events and circumstances attending the publication
of it as could readily be ascertained by the public, is free from ambiguity
in regard to the person referred to, and points clearly to a
well known person, it would be held to have been published concerning
that person, although the defendant should show that through
some mistake of fact, not easily discoverable by the public, he had
designated in his publication a person other than the one whom he intended
to designate. It may well be held that where the language,
read in connection with all the facts and circumstances which can be
used in its interpretation, is free from ambiguity, the defendant will
not be permitted to show that through ignorance or mistake he said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_667'>667</span>something, either by way of designating the person, or making assertions
about him, different from that which he intended to say; but
his true meaning should be ascertained, if it can be, with the aid of
such facts and circumstances attending the publication as may easily
be known by those of the public who wish to discover it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether the defendant should ever be permitted to state his undisclosed
intention in regard to the person of whom the words are used,
may be doubtful. If language purporting to be used of only one person
would refer equally to either of two different persons of the same
name, and if there were nothing to indicate that one was meant rather
than the other, there is good reason for holding that the defendant’s
testimony in regard to his secret intention might be received, but perhaps
such a case is hardly supposable. Odgers, in his book on Libel
and Slander, at page 129, says: “So, if the words spoken or written,
though plain in themselves, apply equally well to more persons than
one, evidence may be given both of the cause and occasion of publication,
and of all the surrounding circumstances affecting the relation
between the parties, and also any statement or declaration made by
the defendant as to the person referred to.” In Regina <em>v.</em> Barnard,
43 J. P. 127, when it was uncertain whether the libel referred to the
complainant or not, and when the language was applicable to him,
Lord Chief Justice Cockburn held the affidavit of the writer that he
did not mean him, but some one else, to be a sufficient reason for refusing
process. In De Armond <em>v.</em> Armstrong, 37 Ind. 35, evidence was
received of what the witnesses understood in regard to the person
referred to. In Smart <em>v.</em> Blanchard, 42 N. H. 137, it is stated that
extrinsic evidence is to be received “to show that the defendant intended
to apply his remarks to the plaintiff,” when his meaning is
doubtful. Goodrich <em>v.</em> Davis, 11 Met. 473, 480, 484, 485, and Miller
<em>v.</em> Butler, 6 Cush. 71, are of similar purport. See also Barwell <em>v.</em>
Adkins, 1 M. &amp; G. 807; Knapp <em>v.</em> Fuller, 55 Vt. 311; Commonwealth
<em>v.</em> Morgan, 107 Mass. 199, 201.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the defendant’s article had contained anything libellous against
A. P. H. Hanson, there can be no doubt that he could have maintained
an action against the defendant for this publication. The name used
is not conclusive in determining the meaning of the libel in respect to
the person referred to; it is but one fact to be considered with other
facts upon that subject. Fictitious names are often used in libels, and
names similar to that of the person intended, but differing somewhat
from it. A. P. H. Hanson could have shown that the description of
him by name, residence, and occupation was perfect, except in the use
of the initials “H. P.” instead of “A. P. H.,” that the article referred
to an occasion on which he was present, and gave a description
of conduct of a prisoner, and of proceedings in court, which was correct
in its application to him and to no one else. The internal evidence
when applied to facts well known to the public would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_668'>668</span>been ample to show that the language referred to him, and not to the
person whose name was used.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, in the present suit, the court had no occasion to rely on the
testimony of the writer as to the person to whom the language was
intended to apply. The language itself, in connection with the publicly
known circumstances under which it was written, showed at
once that the article referred to A. P. H. Hanson, and that the name
H. P. Hanson was used by mistake. As the evidence showed that the
words were published of and concerning A. P. H. Hanson, the finding
that they were not published of the plaintiff followed of necessity.
The article was of such a kind that it referred, and could refer, to one
person only; when that person was ascertained, it might appear that
the publication as against him was or was not libellous, and his rights,
if he brought a suit, would depend upon the finding in respect to that.
No one else would have a cause of action, even if, by reason of identity
of name with that used in the publication, he might suffer some harm.
For illustration, suppose a libel is written concerning a person described
as John Smith of Springfield. Suppose there are five persons
in Springfield of that name. The language refers to but one. When
we ascertain by legitimate evidence to which one the words are intended
to apply, he can maintain an action. The other persons of
the same name cannot recover damages for a libel merely because of
their misfortune in having a name like that of the person libelled.
Or, if the defendant can justify by proving that the words were true,
and published without malice, he is not guilty of a libel, even if, written
of other persons of the same name of whose existence very likely
he was ignorant, the words would be libellous; otherwise, one who
has published that which by its terms can refer to but one person, and
be a libel on him only, might be responsible for half a dozen libels
on as many different persons, and one who has justifiably published
the truth of a person might be liable to several persons of the same
name of whom the language would be untrue. The law of libel has
never been extended, and should not be extended, to include such
cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether there should be a liability founded on negligence in any
case when the truth is published of one to whom the words, interpreted
in the light of accompanying circumstances easily ascertainable
by those who read them, plainly apply; and where, by reason of identity
of names, or similarity of names and description, a part of the
public might think them applicable to another person of whom they
would be libellous, is a question which does not arise on the pleadings
in this case. So far as we are aware, no action for such a cause
has ever been maintained. It is ordinarily to be presumed, although
it may not always be the fact, that those who are enough interested
in a person to be affected by what is said about him, will ascertain,
if they easily can, whether libellous words which purport to refer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_669'>669</span>to one of his name were intended to be applied to him or to some
one else.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question in this case, whether the words were published of and
concerning the plaintiff, was one of fact on all the evidence. Unless
it appears that the matters stated in the report would not warrant a
finding for the defendant, there must be judgment for him, even if the
finding of fact might have been the other way. We are of opinion
that the finding was well warranted, and there must be,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Holmes, J.</span> I am unable to agree with the decision of the majority
of the court, and as the question is of some importance in its bearing
on legal principles, and as I am not alone in my views, I think it
proper to state the considerations which have occurred to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those words [H. P. Hanson, a real estate and insurance broker of
South Boston] describe the plaintiff, and no one else. The only
ground, then, on which the matters alleged of and concerning that
subject can be found not to be alleged of and concerning the plaintiff,
is that the defendant did not intend them to apply to him, and the
question is narrowed to whether such a want of intention is enough
to warrant the finding, or to constitute a defence, when the inevitable
consequence of the defendant’s acts is that the public, or that part of
it which knows the plaintiff, will suppose that the defendant did use
its language about him.</p>

<p class='c007'>On general principles of tort, the private intent of the defendant
would not exonerate it. It knew that it was publishing statements
purporting to be serious, which would be hurtful to a man if applied
to him. It knew that it was using as the subject of those statements
words which purported to designate a particular man, and would be
understood by its readers to designate one. In fact, the words purported
to designate, and would be understood by its readers to designate,
the plaintiff. If the defendant had supposed that there was no
such person, and had intended simply to write an amusing fiction,
that would not be a defence, at least unless its belief was justifiable.
Without special reason, it would have no right to assume that there
was no one within the sphere of its influence to whom the description
answered. So, when the description which points out the plaintiff is
supposed by the defendant to point out another man whom in fact it
does not describe, the defendant is equally liable as when the description
is supposed to point out nobody. On the general principles of
tort, the publication is so manifestly detrimental that the defendant
publishes it at the peril of being able to justify it in the sense in which
the public will understand it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A man may be liable civilly, and formerly, at least by the common
law of England, even criminally, for publishing a libel without knowing
it. Curtis <em>v.</em> Mussey, 6 Gray, 261; Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Morgan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_670'>670</span>107 Mass. 199; Dunn <em>v.</em> Hall, 1 Ind. 344; Rex <em>v.</em> Walter, 3 Esp. 21;
Rex <em>v.</em> Gutch, Mood. &amp; Malk. 433. See also Rex <em>v.</em> Cuthell, 27 St. Tr.
642. And it seems he might be liable civilly for publishing it by mistake,
intending to publish another paper. Mayne <em>v.</em> Fletcher, 4 Man.
&amp; Ry. 311, 312, note. Odgers, Libel and Slander, (2d ed.) 5. So,
when by mistake the name of the plaintiff’s firm was inserted under
the head “First Meetings under the Bankruptcy Act,” instead of
under “Dissolution of Partnerships.” Shepheard <em>v.</em> Whitaker, L. R.
10 C. P. 502. So a man will be liable for a slander spoken in jest, if
the by-standers reasonably understand it to be a serious charge.
Donoghue <em>v.</em> Hayes, Hayes, 265. Of course it does not matter that
the defendant did not intend to injure the plaintiff, if that was the
manifest tendency of his words. Curtis <em>v.</em> Mussey, 6 Gray, 261, 273;
Haire <em>v.</em> Wilson, 9 B. &amp; C. 643. And to prove a publication concerning
the plaintiff, it lies upon him “only to show that this construction,
which they’ve put upon the paper, is such as the generality of readers
must take it in, according to the obvious and natural sense of it.”
The King <em>v.</em> Clerk, 1 Barnard. 304, 305. See further Fox <em>v.</em> Broderick,
14 Ir. C. L. 453; Odgers, Libel and Slander, (2d ed.) 155, 269,
435, 638. In Smith <em>v.</em> Ashley, 11 Met. 367, the jury were instructed
that the publisher of a newspaper article written by another, and
supposed and still asserted by the defendant to be a fiction, was not
liable if he believed it to be so. Under the circumstances of the case,
“believed” meant “reasonably believed.” Even so qualified, it is
questioned by Mr. Odgers if the ruling would be followed in England.
Odgers, Libel and Slander, (1st Am. ed.) 387, (2d ed.) 638. But it
has no application to this case, as here the defendant’s agent wrote
the article, and there is no evidence that he or the defendant had
any reason to believe that H. P. Hanson meant any one but the
plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>The foregoing decisions show that slander and libel now, as in the
beginning, are governed by the general principles of the law of tort,
and, if that be so, the defendant’s ignorance that the words which it
published identified the plaintiff is no more an excuse, than ignorance
of any other fact about which the defendant has been put on inquiry.
To hold that a man publishes such words at his peril, when they are
supposed to describe a different man, is hardly a severer application
of the law, than when they are uttered about a man believed on the
strongest grounds to be dead, and thus not capable of being the subject
of a tort. It has been seen that by the common law of England
such a belief would not be an excuse. Hearne <em>v.</em> Stowell, 12 A. &amp; E.
719, 726, denying Parson Prick’s case.</p>

<p class='c007'>I feel some difficulty in putting my finger on the precise point of
difference between the minority and majority of the court. I understand,
however, that a somewhat unwilling assent is yielded to the
general views which I have endeavored to justify, and I should gather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_671'>671</span>that the exact issue was to be found in the statement that the article
was one describing the conduct of a prisoner brought before the
Municipal Court of Boston, coupled with the later statement that the
language, taken in connection with the publicly known circumstances
under which it was written, showed at once that the article referred
to A. P. H. Hanson, and that the name of H. P. Hanson was used by
mistake. I have shown why it seems to me that these statements are
misleading. I only will add on this point, that I do not know what
the publicly known circumstances are. I think it is a mistake of fact
to suppose that the public generally know who was before the Municipal
Criminal Court on a given day. I think it is a mistake of law
to say that, because a small part of the public have that knowledge,
the plaintiff cannot recover for the harm done him in the eyes of the
greater part of the public, probably including all his acquaintances
who are ignorant about the matter, and I also think it no sufficient
answer to say that they might consult the criminal records, and find
out that probably there was some error. Blake <em>v.</em> Stevens, 4 F. &amp; F.
232, 240. If the case should proceed further on the facts, it might
appear that, in view of the plaintiff’s character and circumstances, all
who knew him would assume that there was a mistake, that the harm
to him was merely nominal, and that he had been too hasty in resorting
to an action to vindicate himself. But that question is not before
us.</p>

<p class='c007'>With reference to the suggestion that, if the article, in addition to
what was true concerning A. P. H. Hanson, had contained matter
which was false and libellous as to him, he might have maintained an
action, it is unnecessary to express an opinion. I think the proposition
less obvious than that the plaintiff can maintain one. If an
article should describe the subject of its statements by two sets of
marks, one of which identified one man and one of which identified
another, and a part of the public naturally and reasonably were led by
the one set to apply the statements to one plaintiff, and another part
were led in the same way by the other set to apply them to another,
I see no absurdity in allowing two actions to be maintained. But that
is not this case.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even if the plaintiff and A. P. H. Hanson had borne the same
name, and the article identified its subject only by a proper name,
very possibly that would not be enough to raise the question. For, as
every one knows, a proper name always purports to designate one
person and no other, and although, through the imperfection of our
system of naming, the same combination of letters and sounds may be
applied to two or more, the name of each, in theory of law, is distinct,
although there is no way of finding out which person was named
but by inquiring which was meant. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Licet idem sit nomen, tamen

<h4 class='c013'>PECK <em>v.</em> TRIBUNE COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court of the United States, May 17, 1909.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 214 United States Reports, 185.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Mr. Justice Holmes</span> delivered the opinion of the court.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is an action on the case for a libel. The libel alleged is found
in an advertisement printed in the defendant’s newspaper, <cite>The Chicago
Sunday Tribune</cite>, and so far as is material is as follows: “Nurse and
Patients Praise Duffy’s—Mrs. A. Schuman, One of Chicago’s Most
Capable and Experienced Nurses, Pays an Eloquent Tribute to the
Great Invigorating, Life-Giving and Curative Properties of Duffy’s
Pure Malt Whiskey....” Then followed a portrait of the plaintiff,
with the words “Mrs. A. Schuman” under it. Then, in quotation
marks, “After years of constant use of your Pure Malt Whiskey, both
by myself and as given to patients in my capacity as nurse, I have no
hesitation in recommending it as the very best tonic and stimulant
for all weak and rundown conditions,” &amp;c., &amp;c., with the words “Mrs.
A. Schuman, 1576 Mozart St., Chicago, Ill.,” at the end, not in quotation
marks, but conveying the notion of a signature, or at least that
the words were hers. The declaration alleged that the plaintiff was
not Mrs. Schuman, was not a nurse, and was a total abstainer from
whiskey and all spirituous liquors. There was also a count for publishing
the plaintiff’s likeness without leave. The defendant pleaded
not guilty. At the trial, subject to exceptions, the judge excluded
the plaintiff’s testimony in support of her allegations just stated, and
directed a verdict for the defendant. His action was sustained by the
Circuit Court of Appeals, 154 Fed. Rep. 330; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span>, 83 C. C. A. 202.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course the insertion of the plaintiff’s picture in the place and
with the concomitants that we have described imported that she was
the nurse and made the statements set forth, as rightly was decided in
Wandt <em>v.</em> Hearst’s Chicago American, 129 Wisconsin, 419, 421. Morrison
<em>v.</em> Smith, 177 N. Y. 366. Therefore the publication was of and
concerning the plaintiff, notwithstanding the presence of another fact,
the name of the real signer of the certificate, if that was Mrs. Schuman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_673'>673</span>that was inconsistent, when all the facts were known, with the
plaintiff’s having signed or adopted it. Many might recognize the
plaintiff’s face without knowing her name, and those who did know
it might be led to infer that she had sanctioned the publication under
an alias. There was some suggestion that the defendant published the
portrait by mistake, and without knowledge that it was the plaintiff’s
portrait or was not what it purported to be. But the fact, if it was
one, was no excuse. If the publication was libellous the defendant
took the risk. As was said of such matters by Lord Mansfield, “Whatever
a man publishes he publishes at his peril.” The King <em>v.</em> Woodfall,
Lofft, 776, 781. See further Hearne <em>v.</em> Stowell, 12 A. &amp; E. 719,
726; Shepheard <em>v.</em> Whitaker, L. R. 10 C. P. 502; Clark <em>v.</em> North
American Co., 203 Pa. St. 346, 351, 352. The reason is plain. A
libel is harmful on its face. If a man sees fit to publish manifestly
hurtful statements concerning an individual, without other justification
than exists for an advertisement or a piece of news, the usual
principles of tort will make him liable, if the statements are false or
are true only of some one else. See Morasse <em>v.</em> Brochu, 151 Massachusetts,
567, 575.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question, then, is whether the publication was a libel. It was
held by the Circuit Court of Appeals not to be, or at most to entitle
the plaintiff only to nominal damages, no special damage being alleged.
It was pointed out that there was no general consensus of opinion that
to drink whiskey is wrong or that to be a nurse is discreditable. It
might have been added that very possibly giving a certificate and the
use of one’s portrait in aid of an advertisement would be regarded
with irony, or a stronger feeling, only by a few. But it appears to us
that such inquiries are beside the point. It may be that the action
for libel is of little use, but while it is maintained it should be governed
by the general principles of tort. If the advertisement obviously
would hurt the plaintiff in the estimation of an important and respectable
part of the community, liability is not a question of a majority
vote.</p>

<p class='c007'>We know of no decision in which this matter is discussed upon
principle. But obviously an unprivileged falsehood need not entail
universal hatred to constitute a cause of action. No falsehood is
thought about or even known by all the world. No conduct is hated
by all. That it will be known by a large number and will lead an
appreciable fraction of that number to regard the plaintiff with contempt
is enough to do her practical harm. Thus if a doctor were
represented as advertising, the fact that it would affect his standing
with others of his profession might make the representation actionable,
although advertising is not reputed dishonest and even seems to
be regarded by many with pride. See Martin <em>v.</em> The Picayune, 115
Louisiana, 979. It seems to us impossible to say that the obvious
tendency of what is imputed to the plaintiff by this advertisement is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_674'>674</span>not seriously to hurt her standing with a considerable and respectable
class in the community. Therefore it was the plaintiff’s right to prove
her case and go to the jury, and the defendant would have got all that
it could ask if [it] had been permitted to persuade them, if it could,
to take a contrary view. Culmer <em>v.</em> Canby, 101 Fed. Rep. 195, 197;
Twombly <em>v.</em> Monroe, 136 Massachusetts, 464, 469. See Gates <em>v.</em> New
York Recorder Co., 155 N. Y. 228.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is unnecessary to consider the question whether the publication
of the plaintiff’s likeness was a tort <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. It is enough for the present
case that the law should at least be prompt to recognize the injuries
that may arise from an unauthorized use in connection with
other facts, even if more subtilty is needed to state the wrong than
is needed here. In this instance we feel no doubt.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>E. HULTON AND COMPANY <em>v.</em> JONES<br /> <span class='sc'>In the House of Lords, December 6, 1909.</span><br /> <em>Reported in [1909] Appeal Cases, 20.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>The following statement is taken from the opinion of Lord Alverstone,
C. J., in the Court of Appeal.<a id='r430'></a><a href='#f430' class='c015'><sup>[430]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“The action was brought by the plaintiff, a member of the Bar,
in respect of a libel published in the <cite>Sunday Chronicle</cite> on July 12,
1908 (the passages complained of are set out in the statement of
claim), which appeared in an article in the defendants’ paper purporting
to describe what the Paris correspondent of the paper had witnessed
at Dieppe, and the particular passage on which the question
really turns was in these words: ‘“Whist! there is Artemus Jones
with a woman who is not his wife, who must be, you know—the other
thing!” whispers a fair neighbor of mine excitedly into her bosom
friend’s ear. Really, is it not surprising how certain of our fellow-countrymen
behave when they come abroad?’ It was alleged by the
plaintiff that this passage was a libel upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The material facts which were proved in evidence at the trial were
as follows. The plaintiff, whose real name is Thomas Jones, is thirty-seven
years old, and since the year 1901 has been a member of the Bar,
practising on the North Wales Circuit. His baptismal name was
Thomas Jones, but ever since he was at school he has been known by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_675'>675</span>the name of Artemus Jones or Thomas Artemus Jones. He was confirmed
in the latter name in the year 1886, and it appears to have
been given him by his father in order to distinguish him from other
persons of the name of Jones. The defendants alleged that the name
was used as a fictitious name adopted by the writer of the article
without any knowledge of the existence of the plaintiff or of any person
named Artemus Jones; and both the writer and the editor, who
were called as witnesses by the defendants under circumstances to
which I shall have to refer, stated that they had no knowledge whatever
of the plaintiff, and had no intention to refer to him, and that so
far as they were concerned the name was entirely an imaginary name.
The counsel for the plaintiff accepted the explanation given by the
writer, Mr. Dawbarn, and the editor, Mr. Woodbridge, and expressly
stated that he did not, after their evidence, allege that they or either of
them were in fact actuated by malice, or intended to refer to the plaintiff
in their article. Some question was raised both at the trial and on
the appeal before us as to the possibility of there being other individuals
in the employment of the defendant company who were actuated
by express malice towards the plaintiff, but for the purpose of
my judgment I assume that there was no proof of malice in fact
on the part of any agent or servant of the defendants. The plaintiff
called five witnesses who stated that upon reading the article
they thought that it referred to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff was
prepared to call further witnesses to give evidence to the same effect,
but, at the suggestion of the learned judge, he abstained from calling
them....</p>

<p class='c007'>“At the conclusion of the plaintiff’s case, Mr. Langdon, who was
then the leading counsel for the defendants, submitted that, as the
name Artemus Jones was a fictitious name, coined by the writer of the
article, and not intended to refer to any particular individual at all,
it was not a libel on anybody, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</span></i> not on the plaintiff himself.
In support of this contention the case of Harrison <em>v.</em> Smith,
20 L. T. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 713, was at that stage of the proceedings cited to the
learned judge. He ruled that, if a person chooses to publish a thing
of this description, the question is not whether the man really intended
it, but whether it would be understood by readers to apply to a particular
person, adding that, if sensible readers would see at once that
it was only an imaginary thing, if any one reading it would see that
it did not refer to a gentleman who happened to bear the name of
Artemus Jones, it would not be a libel, but if he would think the contrary,
that it did not refer to an imaginary person, but to a real individual,
the action might be maintained.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It also appeared that up to the year 1901 plaintiff had contributed
signed articles to defendants’ newspaper.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial before Channell, J., the plaintiff had a verdict for £1750,
upon which judgment was rendered. Defendants appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_676'>676</span>The Court of Appeal (Lord Alverstone, C. J., and Farwell, L. J.,—Fletcher
Moulton, L. J., dissenting) dismissed the appeal. Jones <em>v.</em>
E. Hulton &amp; Co., [1909] 2 K. B. 444.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendants then appealed to the House of Lords.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Loreburn, L. C.</span> My Lords, I think this appeal must be dismissed.
A question in regard to the law of libel has been raised which
does not seem to me to be entitled to the support of your Lordships.
Libel is a tortious act. What does the tort consist in? It consists in
using language which others knowing the circumstances would reasonably
think to be defamatory of the person complaining of and injured
by it. A person charged with libel cannot defend himself by showing
that he intended in his own breast not to defame, or that he intended
not to defame the plaintiff, if in fact he did both. He has none the
less imputed something disgraceful and has none the less injured the
plaintiff. A man in good faith may publish a libel believing it to be
true, and it may be found by the jury that he acted in good faith
believing it to be true, and reasonably believing it to be true, but that
in fact the statement was false. Under those circumstances he has no
defence to the action, however excellent his intention. If the intention
of the writer be immaterial in considering whether the matter
written is defamatory, I do not see why it need be relevant in considering
whether it is defamatory of the plaintiff. The writing, according
to the old form, must be malicious, and it must be of and concerning
the plaintiff. Just as the defendant could not excuse himself from
malice by proving that he wrote it in the most benevolent spirit, so he
cannot show that the libel was not of and concerning the plaintiff by
proving that he never heard of the plaintiff. His intention in both
respects equally is inferred from what he did. His remedy is to abstain
from defamatory words.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is suggested that there was a misdirection by the learned judge
in this case. I see none. He lays down in his summing up the law
as follows: “The real point upon which your verdict must turn is,
ought or ought not sensible and reasonable people reading this article
to think that it was a mere imaginary person such as I have said—Tom
Jones, Mr. Pecksniff as a humbug, Mr. Stiggins, or any of that
sort of names that one reads of in literature used as types? If you
think any reasonable person would think that, it is not actionable at
all. If, on the other hand, you do not think that, but think that
people would suppose it to mean some real person—those who did
not know the plaintiff of course would not know who the real person
was, but those who did know of the existence of the plaintiff would
think that it was the plaintiff—then the action is maintainable, subject
to such damages as you think under all the circumstances are fair
and right to give to the plaintiff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I see no objection in law to that passage. The damages are certainly
heavy, but I think your Lordships ought to remember two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_677'>677</span>things. The first is that the jury were entitled to think, in the absence
of proof satisfactory to them (and they were the judges of it),
that some ingredient of recklessness, or more than recklessness, entered
into the writing and the publication of this article, especially
as Mr. Jones, the plaintiff, had been employed on this very newspaper,
and his name was well known in the paper and also well known in the
district in which the paper circulated. In the second place the jury
were entitled to say this kind of article is to be condemned. There is
no tribunal more fitted to decide in regard to publication, especially
publications in the newspaper Press, whether they bear a stamp and
character which ought to enlist sympathy and to secure protection.
If they think that the license is not fairly used and that the tone and
style of the libel is reprehensible and ought to be checked, it is for
the jury to say so; and for my part, although I think the damages
are certainly high, I am not prepared to advise your Lordships to
interfere, especially as the Court of Appeal have not thought it right
to interfere, with the verdict.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Littledale, J.</span> For the reasons already given by my Brother
Bayley, I think that the plea is bad; but with reference to the resolution
in Lord Northampton’s case, I will say a few words. That
resolution has been frequently referred to within the last thirty years,
and though not expressly overruled has been generally disapproved of.
The latter part of that resolution is extrajudicial, for it was not necessary
to come to any resolution respecting private slander in the Star
Chamber. It is somewhat inconsistent with the third resolution,
where it is laid down, “that if one hear false and horrible rumors,
either of the king or of any of the grandees, it is not lawful for him to
relate to others that he heard J. S. say such false and horrible words,
for if it should be lawful, by this means <em>they may be published generally.</em>”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_678'>678</span>It was resolved then, that in the case of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scandalum magnatum</span></i>
it was not lawful to repeat slander, because, if it was, it might circulate

of slander, though differing in degree, would follow from the repetition
of slander in either case. The fourth resolution, however, in terms,
perhaps does not go the length of saying that a defendant may justify
the repetition of slander generally, but only that he may justify under
certain circumstances. Assuming that it imports that a defendant
may justify the repetition of slander generally, by showing that he
named his original author, I think that it is not law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The declaration, which contains a technical statement of the facts
necessary to support the action, alleges that the defendant falsely and
maliciously published the slander to the plaintiff’s damage. In order
to maintain such an action, there must be malice in the defendant and
a damage to the plaintiff, and the words must be untrue. Where
words, falsely and maliciously spoken, as in this case, are actionable
in themselves, the law <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> presumes a consequent damage
without proof. In other cases actual damage must be proved. To
constitute a good defence, therefore, to such an action, where the publication
of the slander is not intended to be denied, the defendant must
negative the charge of malice (which in its legal sense denotes a wrongful
act done intentionally without just cause or excuse), or show that
the plaintiff is not entitled to recover damages. It is competent to a
defendant, upon the general issue, to show that the words were not
spoken maliciously; by proving that they were spoken on an occasion,
or under circumstances which the law, on grounds of public policy,
allows, as in the course of a parliamentary or judicial proceeding, or
in giving the character of a servant. But if the defendant relies upon
the truth as an answer to the action, he must plead that matter specially;
because the truth is an answer to the action, not because it
negatives the charge of malice (for a person may wrongfully or maliciously
utter slanderous matter though true, and thereby subject himself
to an indictment), but because it shows that the plaintiff is not
entitled to recover damages. For the law will not permit a man to
recover damages in respect of an injury to a character which he either
does not, or ought not, to possess. Now, a defendant, by showing
that he stated at the time when he published slanderous matter of a
plaintiff, that he heard it from a third person does not negative the
charge of malice, for a man may wrongfully and maliciously repeat
that which another person may have uttered upon a justifiable occasion.
Such a plea does not show that the slander was published on an
occasion, or under circumstances which the law, on grounds of public
policy, allows. Nor does it show that the plaintiff has not sustained,
or is not entitled in a court of law to recover, damages. As great an
injury may accrue from the wrongful repetition, as from the first publication
of slander, the first utterer may have been a person insane,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_679'>679</span>or of bad character. The person who repeats it gives greater weight
to the slander. A party is not the less entitled to recover damages
in a court of law for injurious matter published concerning him, because
another person previously published it. That shows not that
the plaintiff has been guilty of any misconduct which renders it unfit
that he should recover damages in a court of law, but that he has
been wronged by another person as well as the defendant; and may,
consequently if the slander was not published by the first utterer on
a lawful occasion, have an action for damages against that person as
well as the defendant. It seems to me, therefore, that such a plea is
not an answer to an action for slander, because it does not negative
the charge of malice, nor does it show that the plaintiff is not entitled
to recover damages.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THORLEY <em>v.</em> LORD KERRY<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Exchequer Chamber, May 9, 1812.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 4 Taunton, 355.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>This was a writ of error brought to reverse a judgment of the
Court of King’s Bench. “This was an action for a libel contained in
a letter addressed to Lord Kerry, and sent open by one of his servants,
who became acquainted with its contents. The libel charged his Lordship
with being a hypocrite, and using the cloak of religion for unworthy
purposes.”<a id='r434'></a><a href='#f434' class='c015'><sup>[434]</sup></a> Upon not guilty pleaded, the cause was tried at
the Surrey spring assizes, 1809, when the writing of the letter by the
defendant was proved, and that he delivered it unsealed to a servant
to carry, who opened and read it; a verdict was found for the plaintiff
with £20 damages, and judgment passed for the plaintiff without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_680'>680</span>argument in the court below. The plaintiff in error assigned the
general errors.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mansfield, C. J.</span>, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is a writ of error, brought to reverse a judgment of the Court
of King’s Bench, in which there was no argument. It was an action
on a libel published in a letter which the bearer of the letter happened
to open. The declaration has certainly some very curious recitals.
It recites that the plaintiff was tenant to Archibald Lord Douglas of
a messuage in Petersham; that, being desirous to become a parishioner
and to attend the vestry, he agreed to pay the taxes of the said house,
that the plaintiff in error was churchwarden, and that the defendant
in error gave him notice of his agreement with Lord Douglas; and
that the plaintiff in error, intending to have it believed that the said
earl was guilty of the offences and misconducts thereinafter mentioned
(offences there are none, misconduct there may be), wrote the
letter to the said earl which is set forth in the pleadings. There is no
doubt that this was a libel, for which the plaintiff in error might have
been indicted and punished; because, though the words impute no
punishable crimes, they contain that sort of imputation which is calculated
to vilify a man, and bring him, as the books say, into hatred,
contempt, and ridicule; for all words of that description an indictment
lies; and I should have thought that the peace and good name of individuals
was sufficiently guarded by the terror of this criminal proceeding
in such cases. The words, if merely spoken, would not be of
themselves sufficient to support an action. But the question now is,
whether an action will lie for these words so written, notwithstanding
such an action would not lie for them if spoken; and I am very sorry
it was not discussed in the Court of King’s Bench, that we might have
had the opinion of all the twelve judges on the point, whether there be
any distinction as to the right of action between written and parol
scandal; for myself, after having heard it extremely well argued, and
especially, in this case, by Mr. Barnewall, I cannot, upon principle,
make any difference between words written and words spoken, as to
the right which arises on them of bringing an action. For the plaintiff
in error it has been truly urged, that in the old books and abridgments
no distinction is taken between words written and spoken.
But the distinction has been made between written and spoken slander
as far back as Charles the Second’s time, and the difference has
been recognized by the courts for at least a century back. It does
not appear to me that the rights of parties to a good character are
insufficiently defended by the criminal remedies which the law gives,
and the law gives a very ample field for retribution by action for
words spoken in the cases of special damage, of words spoken of a
man in his trade or profession, of a man in office, of a magistrate or
officer; for all these an action lies. But for mere general abuse spoken,
no action lies. In the arguments both of the judges and counsel, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_681'>681</span>almost all the cases in which the question has been, whether what is
contained in a writing is the subject of an action or not, it has been
considered whether the words, if spoken, would maintain an action.
It is curious that they have also adverted to the question, whether it
tends to produce a breach of the peace; but that is wholly irrelevant,
and is no ground for recovering damages. So it has been argued that
writing shows more deliberate malignity; but the same answer suffices,
that the action is not maintainable upon the ground of the malignity,
but for the damage sustained. So it is argued that written scandal is
more generally diffused than words spoken, and is, therefore, actionable;
but an assertion made in a public place, as upon the Royal
Exchange, concerning a merchant in London, may be much more
extensively diffused than a few printed papers dispersed, or a private
letter; it is true that a newspaper may be very generally read, but
that is all casual. These are the arguments which prevail on my mind
to repudiate the distinction between written and spoken scandal;
but that distinction has been established by some of the greatest
names known to the law, Lord Hardwicke, Hale, I believe Holt, C. J.,
and others. Lord Hardwicke, C. J., especially has laid it down that an
action for a libel may be brought on words written, when the words,
if spoken, would not sustain it. Com. Dig. tit. Libel, referring to the
case in Fitzg. 122, 253, says there is a distinction between written and
spoken scandal; by his putting it down there as he does, as being
the law, without making any query or doubt upon it, we are led to
suppose that he was of the same opinion. I do not now recapitulate
the cases, but we cannot, in opposition to them, venture to lay down
at this day that no action can be maintained for any words written,
for which an action could not be maintained if they were spoken;
upon these grounds we think the judgment of the Court of King’s
Bench must be affirmed. The purpose of this action is to recover a
compensation for some damage supposed to be sustained by the plaintiff
by reason of the libel. The tendency of the libel to provoke a
breach of the peace, or the degree of malignity which actuates the
writer, has nothing to do with the question. If the matter were for the
first time to be decided at this day, I should have no hesitation in
saying that no action could be maintained for written scandal which
could not be maintained for the words if they had been spoken.</p>

<p class='c014'>Demurrer to a statement of claim which alleged that the defendant
falsely and maliciously spoke and published of the plaintiff the words
following: “I will lock you” (meaning the plaintiff) “up in Gloucester
Gaol next week. I know enough to put you” (meaning the plaintiff)
“there,” meaning thereby that the plaintiff had been and was
guilty of having committed some criminal offence or offences. The
plaintiff claimed £500 damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Demurrer, on the ground that the statement of claim did not allege
circumstances showing that the defendant had spoken or published of
the plaintiff any actionable language, and that no cause of action was
disclosed. Joinder in demurrer.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>W. H. Nash</em>, in support of the demurrer, contended that, in order
to make the words actionable, the innuendo should have alleged that
they imputed an offence for which the plaintiff could have been indicted,
and that it was not sufficient to allege that they imputed a
criminal offence merely. He referred to Odgers on Libel and Slander,
p. 54.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Hammond Chambers</em>, contra, contended that, according to the
earlier authorities, the test, in ascertaining whether words were actionable
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, was whether the offence imputed was punishable corporally
or by fine, and that it was not necessary to allege that the words imputed
an indictable offence. He cited Com. Dig. tit. Action on the
Case for Defamation, D. 5 and 9; Curtis <em>v.</em> Curtis, 10 Bing. 477.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pollock, B.</span> I am of opinion that the demurrer should be overruled.
The expression “indictable offence” seems to have crept into
the text-books, but I think the passages in Comyns’ Digest are conclusive
to show that words which impute any criminal offence are
actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. The distinction seems a natural one, that words
imputing that the plaintiff has rendered himself liable to the mere
infliction of a fine are not slanderous, but that it is slanderous to say
that he has done something for which he can be made to suffer
corporally.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_683'>683</span><span class='sc'>Lopes, J.</span> I am of the same opinion. I think it is enough to allege
that the words complained of impute a criminal offence. A great
number of offences which were dealt with by indictment twenty years
ago are now disposed of summarily, but the effect cannot be to alter
the law with respect to actions for slander.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>BROOKER <em>v.</em> COFFIN<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New York, November, 1809.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 5 Johnson, 188.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Spencer, J.</span>, delivered the opinion of the court.<a id='r437'></a><a href='#f437' class='c015'><sup>[437]</sup></a> The first count
is for these words, “She is a common prostitute, and I can prove it;”
and the question arises, whether speaking these words gives an action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_684'>684</span>without alleging special damage.<a id='r438'></a><a href='#f438' class='c015'><sup>[438]</sup></a> By the statute (1 R. L. 124), common
prostitutes are adjudged disorderly persons, and are liable to
commitment by any justice of the peace, upon conviction, to the bridewell
or house of correction, to be kept at hard labor for a period not
exceeding sixty days, or until the next general sessions of the peace.
It has been supposed that, therefore, to charge a woman with being a
common prostitute, was charging her with such an offence as would
give an action for the slander. The same statute which authorizes
the infliction of imprisonment on common prostitutes, as disorderly
persons, inflicts the same punishment for a great variety of acts, the
commission of which renders persons liable to be considered disorderly;
and to sustain this action would be going the whole length of saying,
that every one charged with any of the acts prohibited by that statute,
would be entitled to maintain an action for defamation. Among
others, to charge a person with pretending to have skill in physiognomy,
palmistry, or pretending to tell fortunes, would, if this action
is sustained, be actionable. Upon the fullest consideration, we are
inclined to adopt this as the safest rule, and one which, as we think,
is warranted by the cases. In case the charge, if true, will subject the
party charged to an indictment for a crime involving moral turpitude,
or subject him to an infamous punishment, then the words will be in
themselves actionable;<a id='r439'></a><a href='#f439' class='c015'><sup>[439]</sup></a> and Baron Comyns considers the test to be,
whether the crime is indictable or not. 1 Com. tit. Action on the Case

in the law upon any subject as when words shall be in themselves
actionable. From the contradiction of cases, and the uncertainty prevailing
on this head, the court think they may, without overleaping
the bounds of their duty, lay down a rule which will conduce to certainty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_685'>685</span>and they therefore adopt the rule I have mentioned as the
criterion. In our opinion, therefore, the first count in the declaration
is defective.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>COOPER <em>v.</em> SEAVERNS<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Kansas, December 11, 1909.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 81 Kansas Reports, 267.</em></h4>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Burch, J.</span><a id='r441'></a><a href='#f441' class='c015'><sup>[441]</sup></a> The common law of England was that verbal imputations of
unchaste conduct on the part of a female were not actionable, in the absence
of special damages, unless they related to a person in some office or employment
for which morality and virtue were qualifications (Folkhard, Law Slan.
&amp; Lib. 7th ed., p. 43), and except in the local courts of the city of London, the
borough of Southwark and the city of Bristol, where it was the custom to whip
strumpets at cart’s tail, tingling a basin before them (Odgers, Lib. &amp; Slan.,
p. *84). This rule has been accounted for on the supposition that in the early,
formative days of the common law social relations were rude, manners were
unrefined, and the people were accustomed to hearing gross and vulgar epithets
freely tossed about without regarding them seriously. (Odgers, Lib. &amp;
Slan., p. *86.) The case of Oxford &amp; ux. <em>v.</em> Cross, in the king’s bench, Trinity
term, 41 Elizabeth (1599), Coke’s Reports (vol. 2, p. 307; part 4, p. 18a), is
cited in support of this view, wherein it was said that a custom “to maintain
actions for such brabling words is against law.” Pollock and Maitland discover
a better state of civilization from the early records than the view indicated
takes for granted:</p>

<p class='c019'>“We should be much mistaken, however, if we believed that the temporal
law of the middle ages gave no action to the defamed. Nothing could be less
true than that our ancestors in the days of their barbarism could only feel
blows and treated hard words as of no account. Even the rude <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex Salica</span></i> decrees
that if one calls a man ‘wolf’ or ‘hare’ one must pay him three shillings,
while if one calls a woman ‘harlot’ and cannot prove the truth of the
charge, one must pay her forty-five shillings. The oldest English laws exact
<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bot</span></i> and <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wite</span></i> if one gives another bad names....”</p>

<p class='c019'>This being true, a reason for the rule must be found elsewhere than in any
essential brutality of the early Englishman. The doctrine appears to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_686'>686</span>fully accounted for through the partition of authority in England between
the spiritual and the temporal courts. (Odgers, Lib. &amp; Slan., p. *86.) It is
familiar history that in the middle ages, for reasons and by means which
need not be sketched here, the all-powerful ecclesiastics acquired jurisdiction
over a large portion of the most important concerns of life—testaments,
matrimony, and among innumerable others, defamation. This breach of the
social order was regarded as a sin and was punishable in the spiritual courts
as such....</p>

<p class='c019'>The struggle to limit and define the authority of the ecclesiastical courts
was long and bitter, and frequently exhibited some striking features. In the
progress of the duel the common-law courts used as their principal weapon the
king’s writ of prohibition to restrain the exercise of jurisdiction over causes
which they desired to adjudicate. The ecclesiastics returned the fire by excommunicating
those who sued out such writs. By and by an increasing
number of pecuniary matters came to be regarded as pertaining to things of
this world, and the civil courts finally succeeded in maintaining their right to
administer relief in an action on the case where specific damages were occasioned
by slanderous words.</p>

<p class='c019'>[After discussing the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts, the opinion
proceeds:]</p>

<p class='c019'>Although the English judges felt constrained to follow the common-law
rule until it was superseded by act of parliament, it did not satisfy their
consciences. In 1759, in the case of Jones <em>v.</em> Herne, in the Court of King’s
Bench (2 Wil. 87, 95 Eng. Rep., Full Reprint, 701), Chief Justice Willes, after
holding it actionable to say a man is a forger, added that if it were <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res integra</span></i>
he would hold that calling a man a rogue or a woman a whore in public company
is actionable.</p>

<p class='c019'>Very near the time when this state entered upon its separate constitutional
existence the common-law rule fell under the censure of some of the ablest
exponents of English justice.</p>

<p class='c019'>[The opinion then sets forth a number of judicial criticisms of the common-law
doctrine and proceeds:]</p>

<p class='c019'>From the foregoing it appears that the rule under consideration resulted
solely from the early seizure of jurisdiction over slander by the ecclesiastical
courts, which could not award damages at all, and the inability of the temporal
courts to strip that jurisdiction from their rivals except in cases involving
special damages. It never did rest upon any principle of right or justice or
any decent regard for character. It was unsuited to the true genius and real
needs of the people over whom it tyrannized, even from the earliest times. It
created anomalies in the law of defamation which rendered that law absurd
and grotesque. For example, words “touching” some disreputable good-for-nothing
in his work or trade were actionable. The most sensitive, cultivated,
high-bred woman could be foully slandered with impunity. Written ridicule
of the style of her hat gave ground for exemplary damages. She had no redress
for spoken words inflicting one of the deepest wounds her sex can suffer. The
rule was not merely insufferably wrong; it was wrong in a matter of so precious
a nature that it was shocking. It was suppressed because it had long been
reprobated as odious and was universally detested. The question now to be
decided is, Does that rule obtain in this state?...</p>

<p class='c019'>This is not the case of a principle which commands considerable approval,
is founded upon fair reason, is merely of questionable wisdom, and which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_687'>687</span>therefore ought to be followed until abrogated by the legislature. It is the
case of an outlawed rule of negation whose sole function has always been to
thwart natural justice in one of the dearest and tenderest of human interests.
Therefore its rejection is justified by Duncan <em>v.</em> Baker (21 Kan. 99) and Whitaker
<em>v.</em> Hawley (25 Kan. 674), <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c019'>The world is censorious, and a woman’s or a maiden’s reputation for modesty
and chastity is an asset of inestimable value. Its loss renders her poor
indeed. Injury in fact is the necessary result of such a deprivation, whether or
not the sufferer can point to specific damage in a few paltry dollars or to
liability to a trifling fine if the charge were true. Therefore the pleading of
special damages as a basis for relief ought to be treated as a useless fiction,
like the one condemned in Anthony <em>v.</em> Norton (60 Kan. 341), <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c019'>Taking into consideration the origin and history of the rule, the reason
supporting it, its character, its consequences, and the degree of its appositeness
to our constitution and system of laws, it does not apply to the conditions or
meet the needs of the people of this state, and consequently it is not a part of
the law of this state.</p>

<p class='c019'>This problem has been met and solved by different states of the American
Union in different ways. In some the rule is obediently observed. In some
it is followed under protest—is characterized as a disgrace to the state—but
still is followed. In some statutes have relieved from its iniquity in whole
or in part. In some it is frankly repudiated by the courts because it lacks the
sanction of reason and justice. This court has no legislative functions. As
Lord Campbell said, it is here only to declare the law. Under the statute of
1868 it must determine whether a rule of the common law invoked in a judicial
proceeding contravenes the constitution or statutes of the state, or has been
modified by judicial decision, and whether it is adapted to the conditions and
is suitable to the needs of the people of the state. This duty has been discharged
in the present case.<a id='r442'></a><a href='#f442' class='c015'><sup>[442]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Action for words.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judgment of the court was now delivered by</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bayley, B.</span><a id='r443'></a><a href='#f443' class='c015'><sup>[443]</sup></a> This case came before the court upon a rule <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi</span></i> to
enter a nonsuit. The ground of motion was that the words (in slander)
proved upon the trial were not actionable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two points were discussed upon the motion: one, whether the words
were actionable or not; and the other, whether this was properly a
ground of nonsuit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The declaration stated that the plaintiff was clerk to an incorporated
company, called the Birmingham and Staffordshire Gas Light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_688'>688</span>Company, and had behaved himself as such with great propriety, and
thereby acquired, and was daily acquiring, great gains; but that the
defendant, to cause it to be believed that he was unfit to hold his
situation, and an improper person to be employed by the company,
and to cause him to be deprived of his situation, spoke the words
complained of in the declaration, viz.: “You are a fellow, a disgrace
to the town, unfit to hold your situation, for your conduct with whores.
I will have you in the ‘Argus.’ You have bought up all the copies
of the ‘Argus,’ knowing you have been exposed. You may drown
yourself, for you are not fit to live, and are a disgrace to the situation
you hold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The objection to maintaining an action upon these words is, that it
is only on the ground of the plaintiff being clerk to the company that
they can be actionable; that it is not alleged that they are spoken of
him in reference to his character or conduct as clerk; that they do not,
from their tenor, import that they were spoken with any such reference;
that they do not impute to him the want of any qualification
such as a clerk ought to have, or any misconduct which would make
him unfit to discharge faithfully and correctly all the duties of such
a clerk.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff relied on the rule laid down by De Grey, C. J., in
Onslow <em>v.</em> Horne, 3 Wils. 177, “that words are actionable when spoken
of one in an office of profit, which may probably occasion the loss of his
office; or when spoken of persons touching their respective professions,
trades, and business, and do or may probably tend to their damage.”
The same case occurs in Sir Wm. Bl. Rep. 753, and there the rule is expressed
to be, “if the words be of probable ill consequence to a person
in a trade or profession, or an office.”<a id='r444'></a><a href='#f444' class='c015'><sup>[444]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The objection to the rule, as expressed in both reports, appears to
me to be, that the words “probably” and “probable” are too indefinite
and loose, and unless they are considered as equivalent to “having
a natural tendency to,” and are confined within the limits, I have
expressed in stating the defendant’s objections, of showing the want
of some necessary qualification, or some misconduct in the office, it
goes beyond what the authorities warrant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every authority which I have been able to find, either shows the
want of some general requisite, as honesty, capacity, fidelity, &amp;c., or
connects the imputation with the plaintiff’s office, trade, or business.
As at present advised, therefore, I am of opinion that the charge
proved in this case is not actionable, because the imputation it contains
does not imply the want of any of those qualities which a clerk
ought to possess, and because the imputation has no reference to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_689'>689</span>conduct as clerk. I say as at present advised, for the reason which I
am about to state.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next question is, whether this is properly a ground of nonsuit;
and I am of opinion that, under the circumstances of this case, it is
not. The words proved are nearly all the words which the first count
contains; and if the words proved are not actionable, none of the other
words contained in that count are. When the general issue is pleaded
to a count, it puts in issue to be tried by the jury the question, whether
the facts stated in that count exist. The legal effect of those facts,
whether they constitute a cause of action or not, is not properly in
question. The proper mode to bring that legal effect into consideration
is, before trial, to demur; after trial, to move in arrest of judgment.
The duty of the judge, under whose direction the jury try
questions of fact, is not to consider whether the facts charged give a
ground of action, but to assist the jury in matters of law, which may
arise upon the trial of those facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the defendant, therefore, in this case puts in issue the allegations
in the declaration, and those allegations were proved upon the trial,
we are of opinion that the rule for a nonsuit ought to be discharged;
and, notwithstanding the lapse of time, that there ought to be a rule
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi</span></i> to arrest the judgment, if the defendant be advised to take such
rule.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Slander. The declaration stated that the plaintiff was a brewer,
and that the defendant falsely and maliciously spoke and published of
and concerning him in the way of his trade as a brewer the false,
scandalous, malicious, and defamatory words following: “I’ll”
(meaning that he, the defendant, would) “bet £5 to £1, that Mr.
Jones” (meaning the plaintiff) “was in a sponging-house for debt
within the last fortnight, and I can produce the man who locked him
up; the man told me so himself.” Whereupon the said Henry Pye
then asked the defendant, “Do you mean to say that Mr. Jones,
brewer, of Rose Hill” (meaning and describing the plaintiff), “has
been in a sponging-house within this last fortnight for debt?” and
thereupon the defendant then replied to the said Henry Pye, and the
said other persons then present, “Yes, I do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury having returned a verdict for the plaintiff, the court
granted a rule to show cause why there should not be a new trial, on
a suggestion that the learned judge ought to have left it as a question
to the jury whether the words were spoken of the plaintiff in the way
of his trade, and did not.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Parke, B.</span> It is quite clear that this rule ought to be discharged,
for the only ground on which it was granted has failed, inasmuch as
the learned judge did leave the question to the jury, whether the
words were spoken of the plaintiff in his trade; and, indeed, it is
plain that the words were so used, from the fact that in the conversation
in question the plaintiff was spoken of as a brewer. Independently
of that, however, and even if they were spoken of him in his
private character, I think the case of Stanton <em>v.</em> Smith, 2 Ld. Raym.
1480, is an authority to show that the words would have been actionable,
because they must necessarily affect him in his trade. It is there
said, “We were all of opinion that such words spoken of a tradesman
must greatly lessen the credit of a tradesman, and be very prejudicial
to him, and therefore that they were actionable.” That case is distinguishable
from Ayre <em>v.</em> Craven, 2 A. &amp; E. 2, and Doyley <em>v.</em> Roberts,
1 Bing. N. C. 135. In the latter of those cases the words were not
spoken of the plaintiff in his business of an attorney; and in the
former it did not appear in what manner the immorality was connected
with the plaintiff’s profession of a physician; and it was possible
that such imputations of incorrect conduct, out of the line of
their respective professions, might not injure their professional characters.
But this case is distinguishable, because here the imputation
is that of insolvency, which must be injurious; for if a tradesman be
incapable of paying all his debts, whether in or out of trade, his credit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_691'>691</span>as a tradesman, which depends on his general solvency, must be injured.
The case of Stanton <em>v.</em> Smith, as it appears to me, is good law,
notwithstanding the observations of Coltman, J., in Doyley <em>v.</em> Roberts.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>SECOR <em>v.</em> HARRIS<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New York, September, 1854.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 18 Barbour, 425.</em></h4>

<p class='c022'>Motion by the plaintiff for a new trial, upon a bill of exceptions.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Mason, J.</span> This is an action for slander. Upon the trial of the cause the
plaintiff proved the following words, which were also alleged in the complaint:
“Doctor Secor killed my children.” “He gave them teaspoonful doses of
calomel, and they died.” “Dr. Secor gave them teaspoonful doses of calomel,
and it killed them; they did not live long after they took it. They died right
off,—the same day.” The plaintiff was proved to be a practising physician,
and the evidence shows that he had practised in the defendant’s family, and
had prescribed for the defendant’s children, and that the words were spoken of
him in his character of a physician. The plaintiff claimed that the words were
actionable, and that he was entitled to have this branch of the case, upon the
words, submitted to the jury. The judge at the circuit held that the words
were not actionable, and took them from the consideration of the jury. These
words, spoken of the plaintiff as a physician, are actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, whatever
may be said upon the question, whether they impute a criminal offence. They
do not impute a criminal offence, unless there is evidence, arising from the
quantity of the calomel which the defendant alleged that the plaintiff gave
these children, from which a jury would be justified in finding an intention to
kill them. One of them was three years of age, and the other one year and a
half. If the natural result, which should reasonably be expected from feeding
children of such tender years full teaspoon doses of calomel, would be certain
death, then it is not a forced construction of the words to say that the defendant
intended to charge the plaintiff with an intention to kill these children, in
giving them such doses. It is not necessary, however, to say that the judge
should have submitted this case to the jury upon the question, whether the
defendant did not intend to impute to the plaintiff, by these words, a criminal
offence. I am quite inclined to think, however, that had the judge submitted
the case to the jury upon the imputation of a criminal intent in these words,
and had the jury found that such intent was imputed, we should not be justified
in setting aside their verdict. It is not necessary, however, to place the
case upon this ground; for it is certainly slanderous to say of a physician that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_692'>692</span>he killed these children of such tender years, by giving them teaspoonful doses
of calomel. The charge, to say the least, imports such a total ignorance of his
profession as to destroy all confidence in the physician. It is a disgrace to a
physician to have it believed that he is so ignorant of this most familiar and
common medicine, as to give such quantities thereof to such young children.
The law is well settled that words published of a physician, falsely imputing
to him general ignorance or want of skill in his profession, are actionable, in
themselves, on the ground of presumed damage. Starkie on Slander, 100, 110,
115, 10, 12; Martyn <em>v.</em> Burlings, Cro. Eliz. 589; Bacon’s Abr. title Slander,
B; Watson <em>v.</em> Van Derlash, Hetl. 69; Tutler <em>v.</em> Alwin, 11 Mod. R. 221; Smith
<em>v.</em> Taylor, 1 New R. 196; Sumner <em>v.</em> Utley, 7 Conn. R. 257. I am aware that
it was held, in the case of Poe <em>v.</em> Mondford, Cro. El. 620, that it is not actionable
to say of a physician, “He hath killed a patient with physic;” and that,
upon the strength of the authority of that case, it was decided in this court in
Foot <em>v.</em> Brown, 8 Johns. 64, that it was not actionable to say of an attorney or
counsellor, when speaking of a particular suit. “He knows nothing about the
suit; he will lead you on until he has undone you.” These cases are not sound.
The case of Poe <em>v.</em> Mondford is repudiated in Bacon’s Abr. as authority, and
cases are referred to as holding a contrary doctrine (vol. ix. pages 49, 50). The
cases of Poe <em>v.</em> Mondford, and of Foot <em>v.</em> Brown, were reviewed by the Supreme
Court of Connecticut, in the case of Sumner <em>v.</em> Utley, 7 Conn. R. 257, with
most distinguished ability, and the doctrine of those cases repudiated. In the
latter case it is distinctly held, that words are actionable in themselves, which
charge a physician with ignorance or want of skill in his treatment of a particular
patient, if the charge be such as imports gross ignorance or unskilfulness.
To the same effect is the case of Johnson <em>v.</em> Robertson, 8 Porter’s R. 486, where
it was held that the following words spoken of a physician in regard to his
treatment of a particular case, “He killed the child by giving it too much
calomel,” are actionable in themselves; and such is the case of Tutler <em>v.</em> Alwin,
11 Mod. R. 221, where it was held to be actionable to say of an apothecary,
that “he killed a patient with physic.” See also 3 Wilson’s R. 186; Bacon’s
Abr. title Slander, letter B, 2, vol. ix. page 49 (Bouv. ed.). The cases of Poe <em>v.</em>
Mondford and Foot <em>v.</em> Brown have been repudiated by the highest judicial
tribunal in two of the American States, while the case of Poe <em>v.</em> Mondford
seems to have been repudiated in England; and I agree with Clinch, J., that
the reason upon which that case is decided is not apparent. I do not go the
length to say that falsehood may not be spoken of a physician’s practice, in a
particular case, without subjecting the party to this action. A physician may
mistake the symptoms of a patient, or may misjudge as to the nature of his
disease, and even as to the powers of medicine, and yet his error may be of that
pardonable kind that will do him no essential prejudice, because it is rather a
proof of human imperfection than of culpable ignorance or unskilfulness; and
where charges are made against a physician that fall within this class of cases,
they are not actionable, without proof of special damages.<a id='r447'></a><a href='#f447' class='c015'><sup>[447]</sup></a> 7 Conn. R. 257.
It is equally true, that a single act of a physician may evince gross ignorance,
and such a total want of skill, as will not fail to injure his reputation, and deprive
him of general confidence. When such a charge is made against a physician,
the words are actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. 7 Conn. R. 257. The rule may be laid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_693'>693</span>down as a general one that, when the charge implies gross ignorance and unskilfulness
in his profession, the words are actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. This is upon the
ground that the law presumes damage to result, from the very nature of the
charge. The law in such a case lays aside its usual strictness; for when the
presumption of damage is violent, and the difficulty of proving it is considerable,
the law supplies the defect, and, by converting presumption into proof
secures the character of the sufferer from the misery of delay, and enables him
at once to face the calumny in open court. Starkie on Slander, 581. It was
well said by the learned Chief Justice Hosmer, in Sumner <em>v.</em> Utley, 7 Conn.
257, that, “As a general principle, it can never be admitted that the practice
of a physician or surgeon in a particular case may be calumniated with impunity,
unless special damage is shown. By confining the slander to particulars,
a man may thus be ruined in detail. A calumniator might follow the
track of the plaintiff, and begin by falsely ascribing to a physician the killing
of three persons by mismanagement, and then, the mistaking of an artery for a
vein, and thus might proceed to misrepresent every single case of his practice,
until his reputation should be blasted beyond remedy. Instead of murdering
character by one stroke, the victim would be cut successively in pieces, and
the only difference would consist in the manner of effecting the same result.”
It is true, as was said by the learned Chief Justice Hosmer in that case, the
redress proposed, on the proof of special damage, is inadequate to such a case.
Much time may elapse before the fact of damage admits of any evidence; and
then the proof will always fall short of the mischief. In the mean time the
reputation of the calumniated person languishes and dies; and hence, as we
have before said, the presumption of damage being violent, and the difficulty
of proving it considerable, the law supplies the defect by converting presumption
of damage into proof: Starkie on Slander, 581; in other words, the law
presumes that damages result from the speaking of the words. In the case
under consideration, the words proved impute to the plaintiff such gross ignorance
of his profession, if nothing more, as would be calculated to destroy his
character wherever the charge should be credited. It would be calculated to
make all men speak out and say, as did the witness Richard Morris, “that it
was outrageous, and the plaintiff ought not to be permitted to practise.” The
law will therefore presume damages to result from the speaking of the words,
and consequently hold the words actionable in themselves. The judge at the
circuit erred in taking this branch of the case from the consideration of the
jury, and a new trial must be granted; costs to abide the event of the action.</p>

<p class='c014'>Smith, an innkeeper in Warwick, brought an action upon the case

The defendant moves in arrest of judgment, and for cause shows, that
the words are not actionable; for the words are, that Colonel Egerton
hath set the French pox in the house, which is impossible; for the
house could not have the pox, and the words, “William Smith and his
wife have it,” shall not be meant that they have the pox, but the
house, for that is the next antecedent to the words, to which they shall
refer. <span class='sc'>Roll, J.</span>, held the words here actionable, and bid the plaintiff

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Kelly, C. B.</span> I am of opinion that our judgment must be for the
defendant. The question raised upon this record is whether an action
is maintainable against the judge of a county court, which is a court of
record, for words spoken by him in his judicial character and in the
exercise of his functions as judge in the court over which he presides,
where such words would as against an ordinary individual constitute a
cause of action, and where they are alleged to have been spoken maliciously
and without probable cause, and to have been irrelevant to the
matter before him. The question arises, perhaps, for the first time
with reference to a county court judge, but a series of decisions uniformly
to the same effect, extending from the time of Lord Coke to the
present time, establish the general proposition that no action will lie
against a judge for any acts done or words spoken in his judicial capacity
in a court of justice. This doctrine has been applied not only to
the Superior Courts, but to the court of a coroner and to a court martial,
which is not a court of record. It is essential in all courts that
the judges who are appointed to administer the law should be permitted
to administer it under the protection of the law independently
and freely, without favor and without fear. This provision of the law
is not for the protection or benefit of a malicious or corrupt judge, but
for the benefit of the public, whose interest it is that the judges should
be at liberty to exercise their functions with independence and without
fear of consequences. How could a judge so exercise his office if he
were in daily and hourly fear of an action being brought against him,
and of having the question submitted to a jury whether a matter on
which he had commented judicially was or was not relevant to the
case before him? Again, if a question arose as to the <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fides</span></i> of the
judge it would have, if the analogy of similar cases is to be followed,
to be submitted to the jury. Thus, if we were to hold that an action is
maintainable against a judge for words spoken by him in his judicial
capacity, under such circumstances as those appearing on these pleadings,
we should expose him to constant danger of having questions
such as that of good faith or relevancy raised against him before a
jury, and of having the mode in which he might administer justice in
his court submitted to their determination. It is impossible to overestimate
the inconvenience of such a result. For these reasons I am
most strongly of opinion that no such action as this can, under any
circumstances, be maintainable.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Brett, M. R.</span><a id='r456'></a><a href='#f456' class='c015'><sup>[456]</sup></a> This action is brought against a solicitor for words
spoken by him before a court of justice, whilst he was acting as the
advocate for a person charged in that court with an offence against the
law. For the purposes of my judgment, I shall assume that the words
complained of were uttered by the solicitor maliciously, that is to say,
not with the object of doing something useful towards the defence of
his client: I shall assume that the words were uttered without any
justification or even excuse, and from the indirect motive of personal
ill-will or anger towards the prosecutor arising out of some previously
existing cause; and I shall assume that the words were irrelevant to
every issue of fact which was contested in the court where they were
uttered; nevertheless, inasmuch as the words were uttered with reference
to, and in the course of, the judicial inquiry which was going on,
no action will lie against the defendant, however improper his behavior
may have been.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been contended that as a person defamed has, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i>, a
cause of action, the person defaming must produce either some statute
or some previous decision directly in point which will justify his conduct.
I cannot agree with that argument. The common law does not
consist of particular cases decided upon particular facts: it consists of
a number of principles, which are recognized as having existed during
the whole time and course of the common law. The judges cannot
make new law by new decisions; they do not assume a power of that
kind: they only endeavor to declare what the common law is and
has been from the time when it first existed. But inasmuch as new
circumstances, and new complications of fact, and even new facts, are
constantly arising, the judges are obliged to apply to them what they
consider to have been the common law during the whole course of its
existence, and therefore they seem to be laying down a new law,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_698'>698</span>whereas they are merely applying old principles to a new state of facts.
Therefore, with regard to the present case, we have to find out whether
there is a principle of the common law, which although it has existed
from the beginning, is now to be applied for the first time. I cannot
find that there has been a decision of a court of law with reference to
such facts as are now before us, that is, with regard to a person acting
in the capacity of counsel: but there have been decisions upon analogous
facts; and if we can find out what principle was applied in
these decisions upon the analogous facts, we must consider how far it
governs the case before us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Actions for libel and slander have always been subject to one principle:
defamatory statements, although they may be actionable on
ordinary occasions, nevertheless are not actionable libel and slander
when they are made upon certain occasions. It is not that these statements
are libel or slander subject to a defence, but the principle is that
defamatory statements, if they are made on a privileged occasion,
from the very moment when they are made, are not libel or slander of
which the law takes notice. Many privileged occasions have been
recognized. The occasion, with which we now have to deal, is that a
defamatory statement has been made either in words or by writing in
the course of an inquiry regarding the administration of the law. It is
beyond dispute that statements made under these circumstances are
privileged as to some persons, and it has been admitted by the plaintiff’s
counsel that one set of these persons are advocates: it could not
be denied that advocates are privileged in respect of at least some defamatory
statements made by them in the course of an inquiry as to
the administration of the law. It was admitted that so long as an advocate
acts <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> and says what is relevant, owing to the privileged
occasion, defamatory statements made by him do not amount to libel
or slander, although they would have been actionable if they had not
been made whilst he was discharging his duty as an advocate. But it
was contended that an advocate cannot claim the benefit of the privilege
unless he acts <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>, that is, for the purpose of doing his duty
as an advocate, and unless what he says is relevant. That is the question
which we now have to determine. Certain persons can claim the
benefit of the privilege which arises as to everything said or written in
the course of an inquiry as to the administration of the law, and without
making an exhaustive enumeration I may say that those persons
are judges, advocates, parties, and witnesses. There have been decisions
with regard to three of these classes, namely, judges, parties, and
witnesses, and it has been held that whatever they may have said in
the course of an inquiry as to the administration of the law, has been
said upon a privileged occasion, and that they are not liable to any
action for libel or slander. But it has been suggested that only some of
these classes of persons can successfully claim the privilege of the occasion,
and those are judges, parties, and witnesses, who make statements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_699'>699</span>without malice and relevantly; and that those judges, parties,
and witnesses, who either speak or write without relevancy and with
malice, cannot successfully claim the privilege of the occasion. I am
inclined to think that with regard to these classes of persons the law
has not always been stated in the same manner by the judges, and
some judges have a strong objection to carry the privilege beyond the
point to which they are obliged by authority to carry it; they are disinclined
to admit the existence of the privilege. Other judges are
inclined to carry the privilege to its full extent, and we must see what
is the doctrine which has been finally adopted. With regard to witnesses,
the chief cases are, Revis <em>v.</em> Smith, 18 C. B. 126, 25 L. J. C. P.
195, and Henderson <em>v.</em> Broomhead, 4 H. &amp; N. 569, and with regard to
witnesses, the general conclusion is that all witnesses speaking with
reference to the matter which is before the court—whether what
they say is relevant or irrelevant, whether what they say is malicious
or not—are exempt from liability to any action in respect of what
they state, whether the statement has been made in words, that is, on
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</span></i> examination, or whether it has been made upon affidavit. It
was at one time suggested that although witnesses could not be held
liable to actions upon the case for defamation, that is, for actions for
libel and slander, nevertheless they might be held liable in another and
different form of action on the case, namely, an action analogous to an
action for malicious prosecution, in which it would be alleged that the
statement complained of was false to the knowledge of the witness,
and was made maliciously and without reasonable or probable cause.
This view has been supported by high authority; but it seems to me
wholly untenable. If an action for libel or slander cannot be maintained,
how can such an action as I have mentioned be maintained, it
being in truth an action for defamation in an altered form? Every
objection and every reason, which can be urged against an action for
libel or slander, will equally apply against the suggested form of action.
Therefore, to my mind, the best way to deal with the suggested form of
action is to dispose of it in the words of Crompton, J., in Henderson <em>v.</em>
Broomhead, where he said: “The attempts to obtain redress for defamation
having failed, an effort was made in Revis <em>v.</em> Smith, 18 C. B.
126, 25 L. J. C. P. 195, to sustain an action analogous to an action for
malicious prosecution. That seems to have been done in despair.”
Nothing could be more strong, nothing could show more clearly his
entire disbelief in the possibility of supporting that new form of action.
The answer to the suggested form of action was that during the hundreds
of years which had elapsed such an action never had been sustained.
No reported case from the time of the commencement of the
common law until the present day can be found in which the suggested
form of action has been maintained, and yet it is impossible to suppose
that opportunities for bringing actions of that kind and of carrying
them to a conclusion have not occurred again and again. However,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_700'>700</span>the question is not as to the form of the action, but whether an action
of any kind will lie for defamation uttered in the course of a judicial
proceeding. Crompton, J., in Henderson <em>v.</em> Broomhead, also said:
“No action will lie for words spoken or written in the course of any
judicial proceeding. In spite of all that can be said against it, we
find the rule acted upon from the earliest times. The mischief would
be immense if the person aggrieved, instead of preferring an indictment
for perjury, could turn his complaint into a civil action. By
universal assent it appears that in this country no such action lies.
Cresswell, J., pointed out in Revis <em>v.</em> Smith, 18 C. B. 126, that the inconvenience
is much less than it would be if the rule were otherwise.
The origin of the rule was the great mischief that would result, if
witnesses in courts of justice were not at liberty to speak freely, subject
only to the animadversion of the court.” It is there laid down
that the reason for the rule with regard to witnesses is public policy.
In Scott <em>v.</em> Stansfield it was held that all judges, inferior as well as
superior, are privileged for words spoken in the course of a judicial
proceeding, although they are uttered falsely and maliciously and
without reasonable or probable cause. The ground of the decision was
that the privilege existed for the public benefit: of course it is not for
the public benefit that persons should be slandered without having a
remedy; but upon striking a balance between convenience and inconvenience,
between benefit and mischief to the public, it is thought better
that a judge should not be subject to fear for the consequences of
anything which he may say in the course of his judicial duty. Therefore
the cases of both witnesses and judges fall within the rule as to
privileged occasions, notwithstanding it may be proved that any defamatory
words spoken by them were uttered from an indirect motive
and to gratify their own malice. In Dawkins <em>v.</em> Lord Rokeby, Law
Rep. 8 Q. B. 255, it was assumed for the purposes of the decision, that
the defendant had been guilty of both falsehood and malice; nevertheless
it was held that no action would lie against him for statements
made by him as a witness. The ground of the decision was no doubt
that a witness in giving his evidence should not be afraid of being sued
for anything that he might say. A similar view of the law was taken
in Seaman <em>v.</em> Netherclift; and the same rule has been applied to the
parties. If upon the grounds of public policy and free administration
of the law the privilege be extended to judges and witnesses, although
they speak maliciously and without reasonable or probable cause, is
it not for the benefit of the administration of the law that counsel also
should have an entirely free mind? Of the three classes—judge, witness,
and counsel—it seems to me that a counsel has a special need
to have his mind clear from all anxiety. A counsel’s position is one of
the utmost difficulty. He is not to speak of that which he knows: he
is not called upon to consider, whether the facts with which he is dealing
are true or false. What he has to do, is to argue as best he can,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_701'>701</span>without degrading himself, in order to maintain the proposition which
will carry with it either the protection or the remedy which he desires
for his client. If amidst the difficulties of his position he were to be
called upon during the heat of his argument to consider whether what
he says is true or false, whether what he says is relevant or irrelevant,
he would have his mind so embarrassed that he could not do the duty
which he is called upon to perform. For, more than a judge, infinitely
more than a witness, he wants protection on the ground of benefit to
the public. The rule of law is that what is said in the course of the
administration of the law, is privileged; and the reason of that rule
covers a counsel even more than a judge or a witness. To my mind it
is illogical to argue that the protection of privilege ought not to exist
for a counsel, who deliberately and maliciously slanders another person.
The reason of the rule is, that a counsel, who is not malicious
and who is acting <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>, may not be in danger of having actions
brought against him. If the rule of law were otherwise, the most
innocent of counsel might be unrighteously harrassed with suits, and
therefore it is better to make the rule of law so large that an innocent
counsel shall never be troubled, although by making it so large counsel
are included who have been guilty of malice and misconduct. In
Rex <em>v.</em> Skinner, Lofft, 55, Lord Mansfield, a judge most skilful in
enunciating the principles of the law, treated a counsel as standing in
the same position as a judge or a witness. In Dawkins <em>v.</em> Lord Rokeby,
Law Rep. 8 Q. B. 255, at pp. 263, 264, 268, a most careful judgment
was delivered on behalf of all the judges in the Exchequer Chamber,
and the opinion of Lord Mansfield was cited and adopted. If the
authority of these two cases is to be followed, counsel are equally protected
with judges and witnesses. I will refer to Kennedy <em>v.</em> Hilliard,
10 Ir. C. L. Rep. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 195, and in that case Pigott, C. B., delivered
a most learned judgment, in the course of which he said: “I take this
to be a rule of law, not founded (as is the protection in other cases of
privileged statements) on the absence of malice in the party sued, but
founded on public policy, which requires that a judge, in dealing with
the matter before him, a party in preferring or resisting a legal proceeding,
and a witness in giving evidence, oral or written, in a court
of justice, shall do so with his mind uninfluenced by the fear of an
action for defamation or a prosecution for libel.” 10 Ir. C. L. Rep.,
at p. 209. Into the rule thus stated the word “counsel” must be introduced,
and the rule may be taken to be the rule of the common law.
That rule is founded upon public policy. With regard to counsel, the
questions of malice, <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fides</span></i>, and relevancy, cannot be raised; the
only question is, whether what is complained of has been said in the
course of the administration of the law. If that be so, the case against
a counsel must be stopped at once. No action of any kind, no criminal
prosecution, can be maintained against a defendant, when it is established
that the words complained of were uttered by him as counsel in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_702'>702</span>the course of a judicial inquiry, that is, an inquiry before any court of
justice into any matter concerning the administration of the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am of opinion that the rule of law is such as I have pointed out,
that it ought to be applied in the present case, and therefore that this
action cannot be maintained.</p>

<p class='c007'>From our judgments it is obvious that we dissent from the opinion
of Lord Denman, C. J., expressed by him at Nisi Prius in Kendillon
<em>v.</em> Maltby, Car. &amp; M. 402; 2 M. &amp; R. 438.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>Appeal from the decision of the Common Pleas Division, ordering judgment
to be entered for the defendant. 1 C. P. D. 540.</p>

<p class='c019'>Claim: That defendant said of a will, to the signature of which the plaintiff
was a witness, “I believe the signature to the will to be a rank forgery, and I
shall believe so to the day of my death,” meaning that the plaintiff had been
guilty of forging the signature of the testator, or of aiding and abetting in the
forgery.</p>

<p class='c019'>Defence: That defendant spoke the words in the course of giving his evidence
as a witness on a charge of forgery before a magistrate.</p>

<p class='c019'>Reply: That the words were not <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> spoken by defendant as a witness,
or in answer to any question put to him as a witness, and he was a mere volunteer
in speaking them for his own purposes otherwise than as a witness and
maliciously and out of the course of his examination.<a id='r458'></a><a href='#f458' class='c015'><sup>[458]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Cockburn, C. J.</span> The case is, to my mind, so abundantly clear, and I believe
to the minds of my learned brothers, that I think we ought not to hesitate
to at once pronounce our decision.</p>

<p class='c019'>The plaintiff brings his action against the defendant for slander, alleged to
have been uttered on the occasion of a prosecution for forgery before a magistrate
of the city of London. The defence set up is: “True, I did utter the
words imputed to me, but I spoke them when I was a witness in a case in which
I was called as a witness.” The plaintiff’s answer to that is, “Yes, you were
called as a witness, but you spoke these words when you were no longer giving
evidence, and not only knowing them to be false, but also not in the inquiry,
and dehors altogether the subject-matter of the inquiry, for your own purpose
of maliciously defaming me.” At the trial before Lord Coleridge it appeared
that in the Probate suit of Davies <em>v.</em> May the defendant had been examined, as
an adept, to express his opinion as to the genuineness of a signature to a will,
and he gave it as his opinion that the signature was a forgery. The president
of the court, in addressing the jury, made some very strong observations on
the rashness of the defendant in expressing so confident an opinion in the face
of the direct evidence. Soon afterwards, on a prosecution for forgery before
the magistrate, the defendant was called as an adept by the person charged,
when he expressed an opinion favorable to the genuineness of the document.
He was then asked by the counsel for the prosecution whether he had been a
witness in the suit of Davies <em>v.</em> May. He answered, “Yes.” And he was then
asked, “Did you read a report of the observations which the presiding judge
made on your evidence?” He again said, “Yes.” And then the counsel
stopped. I presume the circumstances of the trial were well known, and the
counsel thought he had done enough. The defendant, the witness, expressed
a desire to make a statement. The magistrate told him he could not hear it.
Nevertheless the defendant persisted and made the statement, the subject-matter
of this action of slander.</p>

<p class='c019'>On the proof of these facts Lord Coleridge reserved leave to the defendant
to move to enter judgment, if the court should be of opinion that there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_704'>704</span>evidence on behalf of the plaintiff which ought to be left to the jury. It occurred
to him, however, that it would be as well to take the opinion of the
jury, and they found that the replication was true, viz., that the words were
spoken, not as a witness in the course of the inquiry, but maliciously for his
own purpose, that is, with intent to injure the plaintiff. Upon these findings
judgment was entered for the plaintiff, leave being again reserved to enter
judgment for the defendant, and the Court of Common Pleas gave judgment
for the defendant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Now, if the findings of the jury had been founded upon evidence by which
they could have been supported, I might have had some hesitation about the
decision. But they were not; and we are asked to come to a conclusion contrary
to what has been established law for nearly three centuries.</p>

<p class='c019'>If there is anything as to which the authority is overwhelming it is that a
witness is privileged to the extent of what he says in course of his examination.
Neither is that privilege affected by the relevancy or irrelevancy of what he
says; for then he would be obliged to judge of what is relevant or irrelevant,
and questions might be, and are, constantly asked which are not strictly relevant
to the issue. But that, beyond all question, this unqualified privilege extends
to a witness is established by a long series of cases, the last of which is
Dawkins <em>v.</em> Lord Rokeby, Law Rep. 7 H. L. 744, after which to contend to the
contrary is hopeless. It was there expressly decided that the evidence of a witness
with reference to the inquiry is privileged, notwithstanding it may be
malicious; and to ask us to decide to the contrary is to ask what is beyond our
power. But I agree that if in this case, beyond being spoken maliciously, the
words had not been spoken in the character of a witness or not while he was
giving evidence in the case, the result might have been different. For I am
very far from desiring to be considered as laying down as law that what a witness
states altogether out of the character and sphere of a witness, or what he
may say dehors the matter in hand, is necessarily protected. I quite agree
that what he says before he enters or after he has left the witness-box is not
privileged, which was the question in the case before Lord Ellenborough.
Trotman <em>v.</em> Dunn, 4 Camp. 211. Or if a man when in the witness-box were
to take advantage of his position to utter something having no reference to the
cause or matter of inquiry in order to assail the character of another, as if he
were asked, “Were you at York on a certain day?” and he were to answer,
“Yes, and A. B. picked my pocket there;” it certainly might well be said in
such a case that the statement was altogether dehors the character of witness,
and not within the privilege.</p>

<p class='c019'>If, therefore, the findings of the jury, that the defendant had ceased to be a
witness when he spoke the words, were justified by the evidence, I should hesitate
before I decided in his favor. But I think the defendant was entitled to
judgment on the first reservation. There was no evidence to go to the jury
upon the plaintiff’s case. What the defendant said was said in his character
of witness; for there can be no doubt that the words were spoken in consequence
of the question put to him by counsel for the prosecution, the object
and effect of the cross-examination having been to damage his credibility as a
witness before the magistrate, and of this the witness was conscious. The
counsel, having put the question, stops; and if there had been counsel present
for the prisoner who had re-examined the witness, he would have put the
proper questions to rehabilitate him to the degree of credit to which he was
entitled. That such questions would have been relevant I cannot bring myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_705'>705</span>for a moment to doubt, relating as they do to the credibility of the witness,
which is part of the matter of which the magistrate has to take cognizance.
That being so, the witness himself, who is sworn to speak the whole truth, is
properly entitled, not only with a view to his own vindication, but in the interest
of justice, to make such an observation in explanation of his former
answer as is just and fair under the circumstances. That is what the defendant
did. The sitting magistrate having allowed the disparaging question to be
put and answered, ought not to have interfered to prevent the defendant from
giving an explanation. I think the statement, coming immediately after the
damaging question had been put to him, must be taken to be part of his testimony
touching the matter in question, as it affects his credibility as a witness
in the matter as to which he was called. It was given as part of his evidence
before he had become divested of his character of witness; and but for the
question of the opposite counsel he never would have made the statement at
all.</p>

<p class='c019'>As to the finding of malice, it is true that what the defendant said might
possibly have the effect of damaging the plaintiff’s character; but can any one
suppose that the defendant had this in his mind when he spoke, or that he intended
to injure the plaintiff? He thought only of his own credit as a witness,
which had been attacked. He spoke, on the impulse of the moment, no doubt
very foolishly; and it was probably his foolish persistence in maintaining the
same attitude and setting up his own opinion against the positive testimony
of the other witnesses that prejudiced the jury against him, and led them to
return the findings they did, founded, in reality, upon no evidence at all. In
my opinion, the Lord Chief Justice should have nonsuited the plaintiff, which
is the conclusion at which the Court of Common Pleas ultimately arrived; for
there really was no evidence that the defendant was speaking otherwise than
as a witness and relevantly to the matters in issue, because relevantly to his
own character and credibility as a witness in the matter. That being so, even
if express malice could have been properly inferred from the circumstances,
the case of Dawkins <em>v.</em> Lord Rokeby, Law Rep. 7 H. L. 744, conclusively decides
that malice has ceased to be an element in the consideration of such
cases, unless it can be shown that the statement was made not in the course
of giving evidence, and therefore not in the character of a witness. A long
series of authorities, from the time of Elizabeth to the present time, has
established that the privilege of a witness while giving evidence is absolute
and unqualified. Allardice <em>v.</em> Robertson, 1 Dow, <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 495, 515, was relied
upon by Mr. Chambers. That was the case of an action against a magistrate
for words spoken on the bench, and Lord Wynford expressly distinguishes the
two cases, and says that the privilege of a judge of the superior courts does
not apply to the judge of an inferior court; and that in the case of the latter
the privilege is not absolute and unqualified, and that a “subordinate judge”
would be liable to an action if malice were proved. It does not, therefore,
touch the present case; and as to a witness speaking with reference to the
subject-matter of the issue, it is clear that the privilege is unqualified.</p>

<p class='c019'>The judgment of the Common Pleas Division must, therefore, be affirmed.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Bramwell, J. A.</span> I am of the same opinion. The judgment of the Common
Pleas affirmed two propositions. First, that what the defendant said was
said as a witness, and was relevant to the inquiry before the magistrate;
secondly, that, that being so, the Lord Chief Justice should have stopped the
trial of the action by nonsuiting the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_706'>706</span>As to the first proposition, I am by no means sure that the word “relevant”
is the best word that could be used; the phrases used by the Lord Chief Baron
and the Lord Chancellor in Dawkins <em>v.</em> Lord Rokeby, Law Rep. 7 H. L., at
p. 744, would seem preferable, “having reference,” or “made with reference
to the inquiry.” Now, were the judges of the Common Pleas Division right in
holding that this statement of the defendant had reference to the inquiry? I
think that they were. There can be no doubt that the question put by the
cross-examining counsel ought not to have been allowed: “Have you read
what Sir James Hannen is reported to have said as to your evidence in Davies
<em>v.</em> May?” What Sir James Hannen had said in a former case was not evidence.
It was, therefore, an improper question, and the answer to it, if untrue,
would not have subjected the witness to an indictment for perjury. But the
question having been put, and the answer having been in the affirmative—and
the question being, as Lord Coleridge observed,  “ingeniously suggestive,”
viz., that the way the defendant had been dealt with on the former occasion
did not redound to his credit as a witness—the defendant insisted on making
in addition the statement complained of. He did so, in my opinion, very
foolishly. It would have been better to have been satisfied with retaining his
own opinion without setting it up in direct opposition to the positive testimony
of eye-witnesses. But he foolishly, as I think, and coarsely exclaimed,
“I believe that will to be a rank forgery, and shall believe so to the day of my
death.” Suppose after he had said  “yes,” he had added in a decent and becoming
manner,  “and I am sorry Sir James Hannen said what he did, for I
took great pains to form my own opinion, and I shall always retain it, as I
still think it right.” Would not that have had reference to the inquiry
before the magistrate? And would it not have been reasonable and right
that the witness should have added that statement in justification of himself?
Surely, yes. Mr. Clarke said he was prepared to maintain that as long as a
witness spoke as a witness in the witness-box, he was protected, whether the
matter had reference to the inquiry or not. I am reluctant to affirm so extreme
a proposition. Suppose while the witness is in the box, a man were to
come in at the door, and the witness were to exclaim,  “That man picked my
pocket.” I can hardly think that would be privileged. I can scarcely think
a witness would be protected for anything he might say in the witness-box,
wantonly and without reference to the inquiry. I do not say he would not
be protected. It might be held that it was better that everything a witness
said as a witness should be protected, than that witnesses should be under the
impression that what they said in the witness-box might subject them to an
action. I certainly should pause before I affirmed so extreme a proposition,
but without affirming that, I think the words “having reference to the inquiry”
ought to have a very wide and comprehensive application, and ought
not to be limited to statements for which, if not true, a witness might be
indicted for perjury, or the exclusion of which by the judge would give ground
for a new trial; but ought to extend to that which a witness might naturally
and reasonably say when giving evidence with reference to the inquiry as to
which he had been called as a witness. Taking that view, I think the first
proposition is established, that the statement of the defendant was made as
witness and had reference to the inquiry.</p>

<p class='c019'>As to the second proposition, that, if the first be made out, no inquiry can
be gone into as to whether the statement was false or malicious or as a volunteer,
we are bound by authority. The case of Dawkins <em>v.</em> Lord Rokeby, Law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_707'>707</span>Rep. 7 H. L. 744, is directly in point, and binding upon us even if we disliked
the decision. Mr. Chambers has not attempted to distinguish that case except
on the ground that the inquiry in that case was before a military court. But it
is clearly not distinguishable on that ground. The learned Lords determined
that what is true of a civil tribunal is true of a military court of inquiry; and
they affirmed most distinctly the proposition that if the evidence has reference
to the inquiry, the witness is absolutely privileged. There is also the case
in the Court of Error of Henderson <em>v.</em> Broomhead, 4 H. &amp; N. 569, which is precisely
to the same effect, and undistinguishable from the present case.</p>

<p class='c019'>I am, therefore, of opinion that the judgment of the Common Pleas Division
was right, and must be affirmed.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>WHITE <em>v.</em> CARROLL<br /> <span class='sc'>Court of Appeals, New York, March 18, 1870.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 42 New York Reports, 161.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Sutherland, J.</span><a id='r460'></a><a href='#f460' class='c015'><sup>[460]</sup></a> On the trial of this action, before Mr. Justice
Potter and a jury at the circuit, it appeared, that in 1858 and 1859,
a proceeding was going on before the surrogate of Montgomery county
<span class='pageno' id='Page_708'>708</span>in which the contested point or question was the testamentary capacity
of one Jay Phillips; that the plaintiff and the defendant were both
at the time, and for some years previously had been, practising as
physicians at Amsterdam, Montgomery county, the plaintiff as a
homœopathic physician, and the defendant as an allopathic physician;
that both had been sworn as witnesses, and testified in the proceedings
before the surrogate, the defendant some time after the plaintiff; that
on the examination of the defendant as such witness, he was asked
whether any other physician was in attendance on Jay Phillips, at the
time he was attending him, and that he answered: “Not as I know
of.” That he was then asked: “Did not any physician attend him at
the time he was at Mrs. Moore’s, when you did not?” That to this
question, the defendant answered: “Not as I know of; I understand
he had a quack, I would not call him a physician; I understood that
Dr. White, as he is called, had been there.” That this evidence was
reduced to writing by the surrogate, and filed in the surrogates’ office;
and thereupon this action was brought, the complaint in which contains
two counts, one for libel, or for words written; and the other for
slander, or for words spoken.</p>

<p class='c007'>No point was made on the trial of the action, that the words alleged
in the complaint had not been proved to have been spoken by the
defendant, but a motion was made on his part to dismiss the complaint,
substantially upon the ground that the words spoken by the
defendant were not actionable, because they were spoken on his examination
as a witness, and were spoken as pertinent and responsive
to the questions asked him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justice Potter denied the motion to dismiss the complaint, and the
defendant excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>In submitting to the jury the question, “whether the defendant, at
the time he so testified and used the words in question, believed the
words so used by him were relevant or pertinent to the question then
on trial,” Justice Potter charged the jury as follows: “That if the
jury believed, from all the circumstances proved, from the questions
put to him, and from his manner of answering, and from the answers
themselves, that he testified in good faith, or in the belief that his answers
were pertinent and relevant, then the law protected him in what
he said; it was privileged, and their verdict should be for the defendant.
That if, on the contrary, they should believe from this evidence,
that the defendant, though testifying at the time as a witness, and
as such entitled to the protection of the law, in so using the words
proved, was actuated by malice; that he used the words for the mere
purpose of defaming the plaintiff, then the law withdrew the protection
it would otherwise have afforded him, and he became amenable
to the consequences of uttering the slander, or of publishing the
libel.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_709'>709</span>There is certainly some doubt whether the defendant’s exception
which he claims applies to this part of the charge, was sufficiently specific
or definite to raise the question as to its correctness; but I shall
assume that it was; and I shall also assume, in view of what I have
said preliminarily, as the counsel for the defendant assumed on the
argument, and assumes in his points, that the only material questions
presented by this appeal, are those presented by the two exceptions
referred to.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, as to the first, it is perfectly clear, that the question, whether
the defendant was protected under the circumstances, was not a question
of law for the court, but was a question of fact for the jury. It
was really a question of conduct, of motive, of good faith and honest
purpose, or of bad faith and malicious purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question was, whether the defendant did, or did not, avail himself
of the occasion to maliciously answer the questions put to him as
a witness, in the way he did.</p>

<p class='c007'>This question was most emphatically a question for the jury; and,
I think it was submitted to the jury as favorably for the defendant as
he had a right to expect or ask.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true, that in submitting it to the jury, Justice Potter assumed
that the defendant, when he answered the questions as he did, knew
what the question in the proceeding before the surrogate was; but
Justice Potter had a right to assume this under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>I think the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>

<p class='c007'>All concur for affirmance.</p>

  <h4 class='c013'>RICE <em>v.</em> COOLIDGE<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, December 1, 1876.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 121 Massachusetts Reports, 393.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Morton, J.</span> This is an action of tort. The principal question raised
by the demurrer is, whether the plaintiff’s declaration states any legal
cause of action. Each count alleges, in substance, that a proceeding
for a divorce was pending in the courts of the State of Iowa, between
Joseph S. Coolidge and Mary L. Coolidge, in which the latter
alleged that the said Joseph S. Coolidge had been guilty of adultery
with the plaintiff; that the defendants conspired together and with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_711'>711</span>said Mary L. Coolidge to procure and suborn witnesses to falsely testify
in support of said charges of adultery; and that the defendants, in
pursuance and execution of said conspiracy, did procure and suborn
certain witnesses named, to testify in said divorce suit, and to falsely
swear to criminal sexual intercourse between the plaintiff and said
Joseph S. Coolidge, and between the plaintiff and other persons, and
to various other acts and things which, if believed, would tend to bring
disgrace and infamy upon the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three of the counts also allege that the defendants, in pursuance and
execution of the conspiracy, published or caused to be published a
printed pamphlet in which the false testimony of such witnesses was
repeated, and made the pretext for false and malicious charges upon
the plaintiff’s character and good name.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gist of the plaintiff’s case is that the defendants have suborned
witnesses to falsely swear to defamatory statements concerning her,
and have done other connected acts in pursuance of a scheme or plan
to defame her. The alleged conspiracy or combination is not one of
the elements of the cause of action. That is not created by the conspiracy,
but by the wrongful acts done by the defendants to the injury
of the plaintiff. If the acts charged, when done by one alone, are not
actionable, they are not made actionable by being done by several in
pursuance of a conspiracy. Wellington <em>v.</em> Small, 3 Cush. 145; Parker
<em>v.</em> Huntington, 2 Gray, 124; Bowen <em>v.</em> Matheson, 14 Allen, 499.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question is presented, therefore, whether the plaintiff can maintain
an action of tort, in the nature of the common-law action on the
case, against the defendants for suborning witnesses to falsely swear to
defamatory statements concerning the plaintiff in a suit in which
neither of the parties to this suit was a party.</p>

<p class='c007'>It requires no argument to show that the acts charged as done by
the defendants, if proved, are a great wrong upon the plaintiff. It is a
general rule of the common law that a man shall have a remedy for
every injury. The plaintiff should have a remedy for the injury done
to her by the defendants, unless there are some other rules of law, or
some controlling considerations of public policy, which take the case
out of this rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants contend that the witnesses who uttered the defamatory
statements are protected from an action, because they were statements
made in the course of judicial proceedings, and that therefore a
person, who procured and suborned them to make the statements, is
not liable to an action.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems to be settled by the English authorities that judges, counsel,
parties, and witnesses are absolutely exempted from liability to an
action for defamatory words published in the course of judicial proceedings.
Henderson <em>v.</em> Broomhead, 4 H. &amp; N. 569; Revis <em>v.</em> Smith,
18 C. B. 126; Dawkins <em>v.</em> Rokeby, L. R. 8 Q. B. 255, and cases cited;
affirmed, L. R. 7 H. L. 744; Seaman <em>v.</em> Netherclift. The same doctrine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_712'>712</span>is generally held in the American courts, with the qualification,
as to parties, counsel, and witnesses, that, in order to be privileged,
their statements made in the course of an action must be pertinent
and material to the case. White <em>v.</em> Carroll, Smith <em>v.</em> Howard, 28 Iowa,
51; Barnes <em>v.</em> McCrate, 32 Maine, 442; Kidder <em>v.</em> Parkhurst, 3 Allen
393; Hoar <em>v.</em> Wood, 3 Met. 193. In the last-cited case, Chief Justice
Shaw says: “We take the rule to be well settled by the authorities,
that words spoken in the course of judicial proceedings, though they
are such as impute crime to another, and therefore, if spoken elsewhere,
would import malice and be actionable in themselves, are not
actionable if they are applicable and pertinent to the subject of
inquiry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We assume, therefore, for the purposes of this case, that the plaintiff
cannot maintain an action against the witnesses in the suit in Iowa,
for their defamatory statements, though they were false. But it does
not follow that she may not maintain an action against those who,
with malice and intent to injure her, procured and suborned those
witnesses to testify falsely.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reasons why the testimony of witnesses is privileged are that it
is given upon compulsion and not voluntarily, and that, in order to
promote the most thorough investigation in courts of justice, public
policy requires that witnesses shall not be restrained by the fear of
being vexed by actions at the instance of those who are dissatisfied
with their testimony.<a id='r462'></a><a href='#f462' class='c015'><sup>[462]</sup></a> But these reasons do not apply to a stranger to
the suit, who procures and suborns false witnesses, and the rule should
not be extended beyond those cases which are within its reasons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The argument, that an accessory cannot be held civilly liable for an
act for which no remedy can be had against the principal, is not satisfactory
to our minds. The perjured witness and the one who suborns
him are joint tort-feasors, acting in conspiracy or combination to injure
the party defamed. The fact that one of them is protected from a
civil suit by a personal privilege does not exempt the other joint tortfeasor
from such suit. A similar argument was disregarded by the
court in Emery <em>v.</em> Hapgood, 7 Gray, 55, where it was held that the
defendant, who instigated and procured an officer to arrest the plaintiff
upon a void warrant, was liable to an action of tort therefor, although
the officer who served the warrant was protected from an action, for
reasons of public policy.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_713'>713</span>The defendants rely upon the cases of Bostwick <em>v.</em> Lewis, 2 Day,
447, and Smith <em>v.</em> Lewis, 3 Johns. 157. But those cases turn upon a
principle which does not apply in the case at bar. The facts in those
cases were as follows: Lewis brought an action in Connecticut against
several defendants, in which he prevailed. Afterwards Bostwick, one
of the defendants in the original action, brought an action in Connecticut
against Lewis, for suborning a witness in that action; and
Smith, another of the defendants, brought a similar action in New
York. It was held in each case that the action could not be maintained,
because, in the language of Mr. Justice Kent, it was “an attempt
to overhaul the merits” of a former suit. The case of Dunlap
<em>v.</em> Glidden, 31 Maine, 435, is to the same effect. Although the parties
to a former action cannot retry its merits, while a judgment therein is
in force and unreversed, yet any person who was not a party to the
action, or in privity with a party, may in a collateral action impeach
the judgment and overhaul the merits of the former action. Those
cases, therefore, are not decisive of the case at bar.<a id='r463'></a><a href='#f463' class='c015'><sup>[463]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants argue that an action of this nature ought not to be
maintained, because the plaintiff therein might, by the testimony of a
single witness, prove that a witness in another action had committed
perjury. The rule of law, that a man cannot be convicted of perjury
upon the unaided testimony of one witness, is a rule applicable only to
criminal proceedings. The argument may go to show that the rule
ought to be extended to civil cases in which perjury is charged against
a witness, but it does not furnish a satisfactory reason why a plaintiff
should be altogether deprived of a remedy for an injury inflicted upon
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is also urged, as an argument against the maintenance of this
action, that it is a novelty. The fact that an action is without a precedent
would call upon the court to consider with care the question
whether it is justified by correct principles of law; but if this is found,
it is without weight. In answer to the same argument, Lord Chief
Justice Willes said: “A special action on the case was introduced for
this reason, that the law will never suffer an injury and a damage without
a remedy, but there must be new facts, in every special action on
the case.” Winsmore <em>v.</em> Greenbank, Willes, 577.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon a careful consideration of the case, we are of opinion that
there are no rules of law and no reasons of public policy which deprive
the plaintiff of her remedy for the wrong done her by the defendants
by suborning witnesses to defame her character.<a id='r464'></a><a href='#f464' class='c015'><sup>[464]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Declaration on a libel published of the plaintiff by the defendants,
in a newspaper called the “Sheffield and Rotherham Independent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Plea. Not guilty. Issue thereon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The libel complained of was contained in a report of an examination
of a debtor in custody, held in York Castle, before the registrar of the
Leeds Bankruptcy Court, pursuant to the provisions of the Bankruptcy
Act, 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 134), ss. 101, 102; and it conveyed
an imputation on the solvency of the plaintiff, who had been the
debtor’s partner. The cause was tried at the last Leeds spring assizes
before Keating, J., when, the publication of the defamatory matter
having been proved, the learned judge told the jury that “the libel
was a privileged communication, and that the defendants were entitled
to the verdict if the jury thought that the libel was a fair report of the
proceedings before the registrar of the Court of Bankruptcy, and published
without malice.” The report contained no original comment
on what passed. The jury found a verdict for the defendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Easter Term last, a rule nisi was obtained for a new trial.<a id='r465'></a><a href='#f465' class='c015'><sup>[465]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pollock, C. B.</span> I am of opinion that my Brother Keating was right
in his ruling. The complaint here made is that certain proceedings
held by a registrar in bankruptcy in York Castle, and published by the
defendant, were libellous on the plaintiff. The defence is, that the
alleged libel was contained in a fair, correct, and <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> report of
what took place; and if these proceedings were in a public court, and
the publication was fair, there is no foundation for this action.<a id='r466'></a><a href='#f466' class='c015'><sup>[466]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_715'>715</span>only question then is, whether the registrar’s court was under the circumstances
a public court. I think that it was. We ought, in my
opinion, to make as wide as possible the right of the public to know
what takes place in any court of justice, and to protect a fair <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>
statement of proceedings there. The jury found that the publication
of this report was <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>, and the verdict, therefore, ought not to be
set aside.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bramwell, B.</span> I am of the same opinion. I think that this court
was a public court. That is shown from the terms of ss. 101 and 102.
And even if it were not so, yet if the officer who holds it chooses to
make it public, it would be public for this purpose. Then as to the
point made, that nothing ought to be published affecting a third party,
even when relevant to the inquiry, I think there is no such restriction.
Those who are present hear all the evidence, relevant or irrelevant, and
those who are absent, may, as far as I can see, have all that is said
reported to them. The doctrine contended for is an entire novelty,
because, if sound, every witness might bring an action against the
newspaper publisher reporting his evidence, and call upon that publisher
to prove all the libellous statements which might be contained in
his examination or cross-examination. I do not think that there is any
such qualification as that suggested, nor do I concur in the other suggestion
made to us, viz., that what is <em>irrelevant</em> and libellous on a third
person is not protected. There are cases where an individual must
suffer for the public good, and it is difficult to draw the line between
relevancy and irrelevancy. My opinion is, that when once you establish
that a court is a public court, a fair <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> report of all that
passes there may be published. Possibly this privilege is applied to
courts of justice, because needless scandals are usually avoided in
them. I am therefore of opinion that this rule should be discharged.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Lord Coleridge, C. J.</span><a id='r467'></a><a href='#f467' class='c015'><sup>[467]</sup></a> I am of opinion that this rule must be
discharged.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was an action against the proprietor of a newspaper for publishing
a <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> and fair report of proceedings before a magistrate.
Three persons, surveyors, who had been employed by a civil engineer
to assist in the construction of a railway in Ireland, hearing that
their employer had been paid, and conceiving that the money due
to them had been improperly withheld by him, went before a police
magistrate in London, and (I must take it for the purpose of my judgment,
and do so take it) applied to him for a summons or order under
the Masters and Workman’s Act. In the result, the magistrate thought
that the facts stated by the complainants showed no ground for a summons
against the plaintiff under the Act; and therefore in the result
it turned out that, in a certain sense, an application had been made to
the magistrate with regard to a matter as to which he had no jurisdiction.
I say in a certain sense: but it has been long held, and I think
most properly held, that it is not the result but the nature of the application
made to the magistrate which founds his jurisdiction: and that,
wherever an application is made to a magistrate as to a matter over
which, supposing the facts to bear out the statement, he has jurisdiction,
he then has jurisdiction to ascertain whether the facts make out a
case for the exercise of that jurisdiction which, if the facts make out
the case, undoubtedly he has.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been laid down again and again in broad terms that the publication
of the proceedings in courts of justice is privileged if the report
of such proceedings be fair and honest; and this is so found to be.
An attempt however has been made (and Mr. Shortt will allow me to
say that, if it were possible to have succeeded, I think his argument
would have succeeded, because he has said everything that could be
said, and has said it well) to distinguish this case and take it out of
the general proposition, by bringing it within an undoubted qualification
which has been grafted upon that general proposition, viz., that
the application to the magistrate here was what may be called an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex
parte</span></i> or a preliminary proceeding. Now, there is no doubt that, in
many cases to which Mr. Shortt has referred, the term “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> proceeding”
has been over and over again used by judges of great eminence,
sometimes affirmatively to say that an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> proceeding is
not privileged, and sometimes negatively to say, this, being a proceeding
not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i>, is privileged; and I do not doubt for my own part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_717'>717</span>that, if this argument had been addressed to a court some sixty or
seventy years ago, it might have met with a different result from that
which it is about to meet with to-day. Speaking frankly,—and it is
useless, if a case has made a certain impression upon your mind after
you have done the best you can to understand it, to say it has not
made that impression,—it seems to me quite plain that in such cases
as Rex <em>v.</em> Fleet, 1 B. &amp; A. 379, judgments of great judges do lay down
the rule that an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> or preliminary proceeding is not privileged on
the ground, good or bad, that it is very hard upon an individual to
have a matter stated against him behind his back which he has no
means of answering; and that oftentimes an accused person will come
to trial, if he be tried, with a heavy weight of prejudice; where the case
against him has been reported in the public newspapers, and his own
answer, if he has one, from the necessities of the case has not been
similarly made known. No doubt there are very strong observations
in those cases adopted in Duncan <em>v.</em> Thwaites, 3 B. &amp; C. 556, which go
very far to maintain that proposition. There is also a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictum</span></i> of one
of the greatest authorities in our law, Lord Eldon, than whom few
greater lawyers have ever sat in Westminster Hall, who is reported, by
Mr. Starkie, Starkie on Libel, 4th ed., p. 191 (9), to have once observed
that he recollected the time when it would have been matter of
surprise to every lawyer in Westminster Hall to learn that the publication
of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> proceedings was legal.</p>

<p class='c007'>But we are not now living, so to say, within the shadow of those
cases: and it is idle to deny that there are cases since that time, in
which the decisions I have just now referred to have been brought to
the attention of the learned judges, where the courts have been pressed
with the authority of those decisions, and have come to conclusions
which it is not for me to say are inconsistent, but which I am perfectly
unable to reconcile with those earlier cases; and I find what I think is
excellent good sense in the judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench in
the case of Wason <em>v.</em> Walter, which explains how that is. It is a passage
which one of the learned counsel read to us, and it is a passage
which upon the whole I should desire to adopt and adhere to: “Whatever
disadvantages attach to a system of unwritten law,—and of this
we are fully sensible,—it has at least this advantage, that its elasticity
enables those who administer it to adapt it to the varying conditions
of society and to the requirements and habits of the age in
which we live, so as to avoid the inconveniences and injustice which
arise where the law is no longer in harmony with the wants and usages
and interests of the generation to which it is immediately applied.
Our law of libel has in many respects only gradually developed itself
into anything like satisfactory and settled form. The full liberty of
public writers to comment on the conduct and motives of public men
has only in very recent times been recognized.” And then the passage
goes on,—“Even in quite recent days judges, in holding the publication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_718'>718</span>of the proceedings of courts of justice lawful, have thought it
necessary to distinguish what we call <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> proceedings as a probable
exception from the operation of the rule. Yet <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> proceedings
before magistrates, and even before this court, as, for instance, on
applications for criminal informations, are published every day; but
such a thing as an action or indictment founded on a report of such an
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> proceeding is unheard of; and, if any such action or indictment
should be brought, it would probably be held that the true
criterion of the privilege is not whether the report was or was not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex
parte</span></i>, but whether it was a fair and honest report of what had taken
place, published simply with a view to the honest publication, and
innocent of all intention to do injury to the reputation of the party
affected.” Now, to the general line of argument in that passage, and
to the accuracy of the statement in the last sentence I have read, I
entirely adhere; and it is familiar that not only are unimportant cases
and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> proceedings published, but a particular class of inquiries
which in some of the earlier cases I find actually by name excluded
from the privilege,—I mean inquiries before a coroner,—are in
cases which may be supposed to interest the public reported in all the
newspapers in the kingdom; and yet no one ever heard, at least since I
have known Westminster Hall, of an action being brought by a person
injuriously affected by such publication, where the report is honest
and <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>, and published without intention to injure. That, therefore,
seems to introduce this element into the determination of these
cases, that there is a certain elasticity in the rules which apply to questions
of privilege (development is perhaps the more correct expression),
and that the courts have from time to time applied as best they
may what they think is the good sense of the rules which exist to cases
which have not been positively decided to come within them. If there
had been a case directly in point in which a proceeding such as this,
where the matter was at an end, and where the publication had been
found by the jury to have been <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>, honest, and fair, had been
held by a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction not to be privileged, I do
not hesitate to say for my own part that I should have gladly acted
upon it, because I do not disguise that my own judgment is not at all
satisfied with the enormous advantage to the public of having every
small personal matter reported day by day, often to the extreme pain
and injury of individuals, which is supposed to form its justification.
Nevertheless, I feel it to be the duty of a judge not to declare what he
considers the law ought to be, but to decide according to what to the
best of his judgment he finds it is: and, if he finds a principle laid down
upon competent authority, it is far better to accept and apply it
broadly and honestly, even if he is not in his own mind satisfied with
the foundation of the rule, than to attempt to fritter it away in its
application to cases which manifestly come within it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_719'>719</span>I come therefore to the consideration of this case feeling that the
general tendency of the law has been to hold such a publication as this
to be within the protection of the privilege. Now, I do find one case
which to the best of my judgment appears to cover this case, and from
which I am unable, according to the principle laid down in it, to distinguish
the case now before us. It is a case to which much reference
has been made, and which Mr. Shortt has dealt with at considerable
length, viz., Lewis <em>v.</em> Levy; and it has no doubt a most important
bearing upon this question. I do not propose to read the elaborate
judgment delivered by Lord Campbell in that case: it is well summed
up in these words: “The rule, that the publication of a fair and correct
report of proceedings taking place in a public court of justice is
privileged, extends to proceedings taking place publicly before a
magistrate on the preliminary investigation of a criminal charge terminating
in the discharge by the magistrate of the party charged.” I
am perfectly aware that there may be subtle distinctions,—distinctions
which I will not say are merely shadowy, but which are subtle,—between
the facts of that case and those of the case now before us: but
I cannot disguise from myself that the <em>ratio decidendi</em> and the argument
by which the court was there led to hold such proceedings to be
privileged, do in effect cover this case. I am of opinion that this is a
case in which there was a judicial proceeding terminating, not in the
discharge of the party accused, because there was no such person
before the magistrate, but terminating in a refusal to proceed with the
charge and to set the criminal process in motion. I am unable to distinguish
the principle of Lewis <em>v.</em> Levy from that involved in the present
case; and I adopt what is said there of the old,—and I may say
great case, because it was decided by judges of high authority,—of
Curry <em>v.</em> Walter, so far back as the year 1796. That case is adopted by
the Court of Queen’s Bench in a written judgment in the year 1858, as
a ground of their decision; and, whatever may have been said about
it in some of the intermediate cases, and the doubts that have been
thrown upon it by some eminent judges, it must I think be considered
to be completely rehabilitated by the judgment of the Court of
Queen’s Bench in Lewis <em>v.</em> Levy, E. B. &amp; E. 537. I am content, therefore,
to rest my judgment in this case upon the principles laid down in
Curry <em>v.</em> Walter, 1 B. &amp; P. 525, and deliberately reaffirmed in Lewis <em>v.</em>
Levy, E. B. &amp; E., at p. 559, and to say that, upon the principles there
laid down, I am of opinion that this rule must be discharged.</p>

what our judgment should be, for as to that our minds were made up at the
close of the argument, but because, owing to the importance and novelty of
the point involved, we thought it desirable that our judgment should be reduced
to writing before it was delivered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main question for our decision is, whether a faithful report in a public
newspaper of a debate in either house of parliament, containing matter disparaging
to the character of an individual, as having been spoken in the course of
the debate, is actionable at the suit of the party whose character has thus been
called in question. We are of opinion that it is not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Important as the question is, it comes now for the first time before a court
of law for decision. Numerous as are the instances in which the conduct and
character of individuals have been called in question in parliament during the
many years that parliamentary debates have been reported in the public journals,
this is the first instance in which an action of libel founded on a report
of a parliamentary debate has come before a court of law. There is, therefore,
a total absence of direct authority to guide us. There are, indeed, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</span></i> of
learned judges having reference to the point in question, but they are conflicting
and inconclusive, and, having been unnecessary to the decision of the

case a report from the inspectors of prisons relative to the jail of Newgate, in
which a work published by the plaintiff, a bookseller, and which had been permitted
to be introduced into the prison, had been described as “of a most disgusting
nature,” and as containing, “plates obscene and indecent in the extreme,”
had been presented to the House in conformity with the Act of 5 &amp; 6
Wm. 4, c. 38. In another report, being a reply to a report of the court of aldermen
on the same subject, the inspectors had reiterated their charges as to the
character of the book, adding that it had been described by medical booksellers,
to whom they (the inspectors) had applied for information as to its
character, as “one of Stockdale’s obscene books.” These papers the House
had ordered to be printed, not only for the use of members, but also, in conformity
with a modern practice, for public sale, the proceeds to be applied to
the general expenses of printing by the House. An action of libel having been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_721'>721</span>brought by Stockdale against the defendants, the printers of the House of
Commons, for publishing these papers, the defence as raised by the plea
which this court had to consider was, first, that the papers in question had
been published by order of the House of Commons; secondly, that the House
having resolved (as it had done with a view to such an action) that the power
of publishing such of its reports, votes, and proceedings, as it should deem
necessary, was an essential incident to the functions of parliament, the question
became one of privilege, as to which the decision of the House was conclusive,
and could not be questioned in a court of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the doctrines involved in this defence, namely, that the House of
Commons could by their order authorize the violation of private rights, and,
by declaring the power thus exercised to be matter of privilege, preclude a
court of law from inquiring into the existence of the privilege,—doctrines
which would have placed the rights and liberties of the subject at the mercy
of a single branch of the Legislature,—Lord Denman and his colleagues, in a
series of masterly judgments which will secure to the judges who pronounced
them admiration and reverence so long as the law of England and a regard for
the rights and liberties of the subject shall endure, vindicated at once the
majesty of the law and the rights which it is the purpose of the law to uphold.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the decision of this court in that memorable case we give our unhesitating
and unqualified adhesion. But the decision in that case has no application
to the present. The position, that an order of the House of Commons cannot
render lawful that which is contrary to law, still less that a resolution of the
House can supersede the jurisdiction of a court of law by clothing an unwarranted
exercise of power with the garb of privilege, can have no application
where the question is, not whether the act complained of, being unlawful at
law, is rendered lawful by the order of the House or protected by the assertion
of its privilege, but whether it is, independently of such order or assertion of
privilege, in itself privileged and lawful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Decided cases thus leaving us without authority on which to proceed in the
present instance, we must have recourse to principle in order to arrive at a
solution of the question before us, and fortunately we have not far to seek before
we find principles in our opinion applicable to the case, and which will
afford a safe and sure foundation for our judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is now well established that faithful and fair reports of the proceedings
of courts of justice, though the character of individuals may incidentally suffer,
are privileged, and that for the publication of such reports the publishers
are neither criminally nor civilly responsible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The immunity thus afforded in respect of the publication of the proceedings
of courts of justice rests upon a twofold ground. In the English law of libel,
malice is said to be the gist of an action for defamation. And though it is true
that by malice, as necessary to give a cause of action in respect of a defamatory
statement, legal, and not actual malice, is meant, while by legal malice, as explained
by Bayley, J., in Bromage <em>v.</em> Prosser, is meant no more than the wrongful
intention which the law always presumes as accompanying a wrongful act
without any proof of malice in fact, yet the presumption of law may be rebutted
by the circumstances under which the defamatory matter has been
uttered or published, and, if this should be the case, though the character of
the party concerned may have suffered, no right of action will arise. “The
rule,” says Lord Campbell, C. J., in the case of Taylor <em>v.</em> Hawkins, 16 Q. B.,
at p. 321, “is that, if the occasion be such as repels the presumption of malice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_722'>722</span>the communication is privileged, and the plaintiff must then, if he can, give
evidence of malice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is thus that in the case of reports of proceedings of courts of justice,
though individuals may occasionally suffer from them, yet, as they are published
without any reference to the individuals concerned, but solely to afford
information to the public and for the benefit of society, the presumption of
malice is rebutted, and such publications are held to be privileged.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other and the broader principle on which this exception to the general
law of libel is founded is, that the advantage to the community from publicity
being given to the proceedings of courts of justice is so great, that the occasional
inconvenience to individuals arising from it must yield to the general
good. It is true that with a view to distinguish the publication of proceedings
in parliament from that of proceedings of courts of justice, it has been said
that the immunity accorded to the reports of the proceedings of courts of justice
is grounded on the fact of the courts being open to the public, while the
houses of parliament are not; as also that by the publication of the proceeding
of the courts the people obtain a knowledge of the law by which their
dealings and conduct are to be regulated. But in our opinion the true ground
is that given by Lawrence, J., in Rex <em>v.</em> Wright, 8 T. R., at p. 298, namely,
that “though the publication of such proceedings may be to the disadvantage
of the particular individual concerned, yet it is of vast importance to the public
that the proceedings of courts of justice should be universally known. The
general advantage to the country in having these proceedings made public,
more than counterbalances the inconvenience to the private persons whose
conduct may be the subject of such proceedings.” In Davison <em>v.</em> Duncan, 7
E. &amp; B., at p. 231, Lord Campbell says: “A fair account of what takes place
in a court of justice is privileged. The reason is, that the balance of public
benefit from publicity is great. It is of great consequence that the public
should know what takes place in court; and the proceedings are under the
control of the judges. The inconvenience, therefore, arising from the chance
of injury to private character is infinitesimally small as compared to the convenience
of publicity.” And Wightman, J., says: “The only foundation for
the exception is the superior benefit of the publicity of judicial proceedings
which counterbalances the injury to individuals, though that at times may
be great.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Both the principles, on which the exemption from legal consequences is thus
extended to the publication of the proceedings of courts of justice, appear to
us to be applicable to the case before us. The presumption of malice is negatived
in the one case as in the other by the fact that the publication has in
view the instruction and advantage of the public, and has no particular reference
to the party concerned. There is also in the one case as in the other a
preponderance of general good over partial and occasional evil. We entirely
concur with Lawrence, J., in Rex <em>v.</em> Wright, 8 T. R., at p. 298, that the same
reasons which apply to the reports of the proceedings in courts of justice apply
also to proceedings in parliament. It seems to us impossible to doubt that
it is of paramount public and national importance that the proceedings of the
houses of parliament shall be communicated to the public, who have the
deepest interest in knowing what passes within their walls, seeing that on what
is there said and done, the welfare of the community depends. Where would
be our confidence in the government of the country or in the Legislature by
which our laws are framed, and to whose charge the great interests of the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_723'>723</span>are committed,—where would be our attachment to the constitution
under which we live,—if the proceedings of the great council of the realm
were shrouded in secrecy and concealed from the knowledge of the nation?
How could the communications between the representatives of the people and
their constituents, which are so essential to the working of the representative
system, be usefully carried on, if the constituencies were kept in ignorance of
what their representatives are doing? What would become of the right of
petitioning on all measures pending in parliament, the undoubted right of the
subject, if the people are to be kept in ignorance of what is passing in either
house? Can any man bring himself to doubt that the publicity given in modern
times to what passes in parliament is essential to the maintenance of the
relations subsisting between the government, the Legislature, and the country
at large? It may, no doubt, be said that, while it may be necessary as a matter
of national interest that the proceedings of parliament should in general be
made public, yet that debates in which the character of individuals is brought
into question ought to be suppressed. But to this, in addition to the difficulty
in which parties publishing parliamentary reports would be placed, if this
distinction were to be enforced and every debate had to be critically scanned
to see whether it contained defamatory matter, it may be further answered
that there is perhaps no subject in which the public have a deeper interest
than in all that relates to the conduct of public servants of the state,—no
subject of parliamentary discussion which more requires to be made known
than an inquiry relating to it. Of this no better illustration could possibly
be given than is afforded by the case before us. A distinguished counsel,
whose qualification for the judicial bench had been abundantly tested by a
long career of forensic eminence, is promoted to a high judicial office, and the
profession and the public are satisfied that in a most important post the services
of a most competent and valuable public servant have been secured.
An individual comes forward and calls upon the House of Lords to take
measures for removing the judge, in all other respects so well qualified for his
office, by reason that on an important occasion he had exhibited so total a
disregard of truth as to render him unfit to fill an office for which a sense of
the solemn obligations of truth and honor is an essential qualification. Can
it be said that such a subject is not one in which the public has a deep interest,
and as to which it ought not to be informed of what passes in debate? Lastly,
what greater anomaly or more flagrant injustice could present itself than that,
while from a sense of the importance of giving publicity to their proceedings,
the houses of parliament not only sanction the reporting of their debates, but
also take measures for giving facility to those who report them, while every
member of the educated portion of the community from the highest to the
lowest looks with eager interest to the debates of either house, and considers
it a part of the duty of the public journals to furnish an account of what passes
there, we were to hold that a party publishing a parliamentary debate is to be
held liable to legal proceedings because the conduct of a particular individual
may happen to be called in question?</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned counsel for the plaintiff scarcely ventured as of his own assertion
to deny that the benefit to the public from having the debates in parliament
published was as great as that which arose from the publishing of the
proceedings of courts of justice, but he relied on the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</span></i> of Littledale, J.,
and Patteson, J., in Stockdale <em>v.</em> Hansard, 9 Ad. &amp; E. 1, and on the opinions of
certain noble and learned lords in the course of debates in the House of Lords
<span class='pageno' id='Page_724'>724</span>on bills introduced by Lord Campbell for the purpose of amending the law of
libel.<a id='r470'></a><a href='#f470' class='c015'><sup>[470]</sup></a> There is no doubt that in delivering their opinions in Stockdale <em>v.</em> Hansard,
the two learned judges referred to denied the necessity and in effect the
public advantage of the proceedings in parliament being made public. The
counsel for the defendant in that case having insisted, as a reason why the
power to order papers to be printed and published should be considered within
the privileges of the House of Commons, on the advantage which resulted from
the proceedings of parliament being made known, the two learned judges, not
satisfied with demonstrating, as they did, by conclusive arguments, that the
House had not the power to order papers of a libellous character and forming
no part of the proceedings of the House to be published, still less to conclude
the legality of such a proceeding by the assertion of privilege, thought it necessary
to follow the counsel into the question of policy and convenience, and in
so doing took what we cannot but think a very short-sighted view of the subject.
This is the more to be regretted, as their observations apply not only to
the printing of papers by order of the House, the only question before them,
but also to the publication of parliamentary proceedings in general, the consideration
of which was not before them, and therefore was unnecessary. Lord
Denman, in his admirable judgment, than which a finer never was delivered
within these walls, and in which the spirit of Holt is combined with the luminous
reasoning of a Mansfield, while overthrowing by irresistible arguments
the positions of the Attorney-General, was content to answer the argument as
to the policy of allowing papers to be published by order of either of the houses
of parliament, not by denying the policy of giving power to the House to order
the printing and publishing of papers, but by saying that such power must be
provided for by legislation. On the subject of the publication of parliamentary
debates he said nothing, nor was he called upon to say anything. That the
Legislature did not concur with the two judges in their view of the policy is
manifest from the Act of 3 Vict. c. 9, passed in consequence of the decision in
Stockdale <em>v.</em> Hansard, 9 Ad. &amp; E. 1, the preamble of which statute recites that
“it is essential to the due and effectual exercise and discharge of the functions
and duties of parliament and to the promotion of wise legislation that no obstructions
or impediments should exist to the publication of such of the reports,
papers, votes, or proceedings of either house of parliament as such house
of parliament may deem fit or necessary to be published.” After which the
Act proceeds to provide for the prevention of actions being brought in respect
of papers published by order of either house of parliament.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards the attempt of Lord Campbell to fix the legality of the publication
of parliamentary debates on the sure foundation of statutory enactment,<a id='r471'></a><a href='#f471' class='c015'><sup>[471]</sup></a>
we think it may be as well accounted for by the apprehension, as to the result
of any proceeding at law in which the legality of such publication should come
in question, produced in his mind by the language of the judges in Stockdale <em>v.</em>
Hansard, as by any conviction of the defectiveness of the law....</p>

<p class='c007'>We, however, are glad to think that, on closer inquiry, the law turns out
not to be as on some occasions it has been assumed to be. To us it seems clear
that the principles on which the publication of reports of the proceedings of
courts of justice have been held to be privileged apply to the reports of parliamentary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_725'>725</span>proceedings. The analogy between the two cases is in every respect
complete. If the rule has never been applied to the reports of parliamentary
proceedings till now, we must assume that it is only because the occasion has
never before arisen. If the principles which are the foundation of the privilege
in the one case are applicable to the other, we must not hesitate to apply
them, more especially when by so doing we avoid the glaring anomaly and injustice
to which we have before adverted. Whatever disadvantages attach to a
system of unwritten law, and of these we are fully sensible, it has at least this
advantage, that its elasticity enables those who administer it to adapt it to
the varying conditions of society, and to the requirements and habits of the
age in which we live, so as to avoid the inconsistencies and injustice which arise
when the law is no longer in harmony with the wants and usages and interests
of the generation to which it is immediately applied. Our law of libel has,
in many respects, only gradually developed itself into anything like a satisfactory
and settled form. The full liberty of public writers to comment on the
conduct and motives of public men has only in very recent times been recognized.
Comments on government, on ministers and officers of state, on members
of both houses of parliament, on judges and other public functionaries,
are now made every day, which half a century ago would have been the subject
of actions or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</span></i> informations, and would have brought down fine and imprisonment
on publishers and authors. Yet who can doubt that the public are
gainers by the change, and that, though injustice may often be done, and
though public men may often have to smart under the keen sense of wrong inflicted
by hostile criticism, the nation profits by public opinion being thus
freely brought to bear on the discharge of public duties? Again, the recognition
of the right to publish the proceedings of courts of justice has been of
modern growth. Till a comparatively recent time the sanction of the judges
was thought necessary even for the publication of the decisions of the courts
upon points of law. Even in quite recent days, judges in holding publication
of the proceedings of courts of justice lawful, have thought it necessary to distinguish
what are called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> proceedings as a probable exception from the
operation of the rule. Yet <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> proceedings before magistrates, and even
before this court, as, for instance, on applications for criminal informations,
are published every day, but such a thing as an action or indictment founded
on a report of such an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> proceeding is unheard of, and, if any such action
or indictment should be brought, it would probably be held that the true criterion
of the privilege is, not whether the report was or was not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i>, but
whether it was a fair and honest report of what had taken place, published
simply with a view to the information of the public, and innocent of all intention
to do injury to the reputation of the party affected.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be observed that the analogy between the case of reports of proceedings
of courts of justice and those of proceedings in parliament being complete,
all the limitations placed on the one to prevent injustice to individuals will
necessarily attach on the other: a garbled or partial report, or of detached
parts of proceedings, published with intent to injure individuals, will equally
be disentitled to protection. Our judgment will in no way interfere with the
decisions that the publication of a single speech for the purpose or with the
effect of injuring an individual will be unlawful, as was held in the cases of
Rex <em>v.</em> Lord Abingdon, 1 Esp. 226, and Rex <em>v.</em> Creevey, 1 M. &amp; S. 273. At the
same time it may be as well to observe that we are disposed to agree with
what was said in Davidson <em>v.</em> Duncan, 7 E. &amp; B., at p. 233, as to such a speech
<span class='pageno' id='Page_726'>726</span>being privileged if <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> published by a member for the information of his
constituents. But whatever would deprive a report of the proceedings in a
court of justice of immunity will equally apply to a report of proceedings in
parliament.</p>

<p class='c007'>It only remains to advert to an argument urged against the legality of the
publication of parliamentary proceedings, namely, that such publication is
illegal as being in contravention of the standing orders of both houses of parliament.
The fact, no doubt, is, that each house of parliament does, by its
standing orders, prohibit the publication of its debates. But, practically, each
house not only permits, but also sanctions and encourages, the publication of
its proceedings, and actually gives every facility to those who report them.
Individual members correct their speeches for publication in Hansard or the
public journals, and in every debate reports of former speeches contained
therein are constantly referred to. Collectively, as well as individually, the
members of both houses would deplore as a national misfortune the withholding
their debates from the country at large. Practically speaking, therefore, it
is idle to say that the publication of parliamentary proceedings is prohibited
by parliament. The standing orders which prohibit it are obviously maintained
only to give to each house the control over the publication of its proceedings,
and the power of preventing or correcting any abuse of the facility
afforded. Independently of the orders of the houses, there is nothing unlawful
in publishing reports of parliamentary proceedings. Practically, such publication
is sanctioned by parliament; it is essential to the working of our parliamentary
system, and to the welfare of the nation. Any argument founded
on its alleged illegality appears to us, therefore, entirely to fail. Should either
house of parliament ever be so ill-advised as to prevent its proceedings from
being made known to the country—which certainly never will be the case—any
publication of its debates made in contravention of its orders would be a
matter between the house and the publisher. For the present purpose, we
must treat such publication as in every respect lawful, and hold that, while
honestly and faithfully carried on, those who publish them will be free from
legal responsibility, though the character of individuals may incidentally be
injuriously affected.</p>

<p class='c007'>So much for the great question involved in this case. We pass on to the
second branch of this rule, which has reference to alleged misdirection in respect
of the second count of the declaration, which is founded on the article in
the “Times” commenting on the debate in the House of Lords, and the conduct
of the plaintiff in preferring the petition which gave rise to it. We are
of opinion that the direction given to the jury was perfectly correct. The publication
of the debate having been justifiable, the jury were properly told the
subject was, for the reasons we have already adverted to, pre-eminently one of
public interest, and therefore one on which public comment and observation
might properly be made, and that consequently the occasion was privileged in
the absence of malice. As to the latter, the jury were told that they must be
satisfied that the article was an honest and fair comment on the facts,—in
other words, that, in the first place, they must be satisfied that the comments
had been made with an honest belief in their justice, but that this was not
enough, inasmuch as such belief might originate in the blindness of party zeal,
or in personal or political aversion; that a person taking upon himself publicly
to criticise and to condemn the conduct or motives of another, must bring
to the task, not only an honest sense of justice, but also a reasonable degree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_727'>727</span>of judgment and moderation, so that the result may be what a jury shall
deem, under the circumstances of the case, a fair and legitimate criticism on
the conduct and motives of the party who is the object of censure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Considering the direction thus given to have been perfectly correct, we are
of opinion that in respect of the alleged misdirection as also on the former
point, the ruling at <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi prius</span></i> was right, and that consequently this rule must
be discharged.</p>

<p class='c014'>Action for libel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The libel was contained in a report, published in a Manchester newspaper,
by the defendants, the proprietors, of the proceedings at a meeting of the
board of guardians for the Altrincham poor-law union, at which <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i>
charges were made against the plaintiff, the medical officer of the union workhouse
at Knutsford, of neglect in not attending the pauper patients when sent
for.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial it appeared that the charges were unfounded in fact, but it was
admitted that the report was accurate and <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>. A verdict was taken by
consent for the plaintiff, with nominal damages and costs, judgment to be entered
accordingly, with leave to move to enter judgment for the defendants, if
the court should be of opinion that the publication was privileged.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Common Pleas Division refused the motion, ordering judgment to
stand for the plaintiff. 1 C. P. D. 781.</p>

<p class='c007'>The libel, &amp;c., are set out at length in the report in the court below.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mellish, L. J.</span><a id='r473'></a><a href='#f473' class='c015'><sup>[473]</sup></a> I am of the same opinion. We are asked to extend the law
of privilege as to the report of proceedings of a public body to an extent beyond
what it has as yet been carried. In Lord Campbell’s time it was supposed
that the privilege only extended to the proceedings in a court of law. A report
of such proceedings has always been held privileged, because all her Majesty’s
subjects have a right to be present, and there would, therefore, be nothing
wrong in putting the rest of the public in the position of those who were actually
present. The privilege has been extended to the publication of debates in
parliament, and properly extended, as they stand on the same principle as the
proceedings in courts of law. There is no doubt this distinction: that as to
courts of law the public have a right to be present, but they are only admitted
to the debates in either House of Parliament when the House chooses to permit
them to be present. The House has a discretion, but when the debates are
held in public, it is clear that a newspaper ought not to be held to commit an
offence by putting those who were not present in the same position as those
who were. It is argued that this privilege ought to be extended as to a variety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_728'>728</span>of other public bodies. I express no decided opinion, and I desire, with the
Lord Chief Justice, to be understood as expressing no opinion; but at the
same time I am clearly of opinion that the privilege ought not to be extended
to such a case as the present. A board of guardians have a discretion whether
or not they will admit the public to their meetings; and whether they choose
to exclude or choose to admit, the public have no right to complain. But I
cannot think that the courts of law are to be bound by the mode in which the
guardians exercise their discretion in admitting or excluding strangers. Although
they admit the public on an occasion when <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> charges are made
against a public officer, which may affect his character and injure his private
rights, it is most material that there should be no further publication; there is
no reason why the charges should be made public before the person charged
has been told of the charges, and has had an opportunity of meeting them; and
I cannot see any inconvenience in holding that the publication is not privileged;
in holding otherwise we should be depriving the individual of his rights
without any commensurate advantage. The law on the subject of privilege is
clearly defined by the authorities. Such a communication as the present
ought to be confined in the first instance to those whose duty it is to investigate
the charges. If one of the guardians had met a person not a ratepayer or
parishioner, and had told him the charge against the plaintiff, surely he would
have been liable to an action of slander. I do not mean to say that the matter
was not of such public interest as that comments would not be privileged if
the facts had been ascertained. If the neglect charged against the plaintiff had
been proved, then fair comments on his conduct might have been justified.
But that is a very different thing from publishing <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> statements, which
not only are not proved, but turn out to be unfounded in fact. I am, therefore,
clearly of opinion that the occasion of the publication was not privileged,
and that the judgment for the plaintiff ought to be affirmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article alleged to be libellous is headed, “The suits against the Massachusetts

<p class='c007'>Whatever may be the rule as adopted and practised on in England, we think
that a somewhat larger liberty may be claimed in this country and in this
Commonwealth, both for the proceedings before all public bodies, and for the
publication of those proceedings for the necessary information of the people.
So many municipal, parochial and other public corporations, and so many
large voluntary associations formed for almost every lawful purpose of benevolence,
business or interest, are constantly holding meetings, in their nature
public, and so usual is it that their proceedings are published for general use
and information, that the law, to adapt itself to this necessary condition of
society, must of necessity admit of these public proceedings, and a just and
proper publication of them, as far as it can be done consistently with private
rights. This view of the law of libel in Massachusetts is recognized, and to
some extent sanctioned, by the case of Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Clapp, 4 Mass. 163,
and many other cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Massachusetts Medical Society were not a private association; they
were a public corporation, chartered by one of the earliest Acts under the Constitution,
which was amended and their powers confirmed by several subsequent
Acts. Sts. 1781, c. 15; 1788, c. 49; 1802, c. 123; 1818, c. 113.</p>

<p class='c007'>The charter invested the society, their members and licentiates, with large
powers and privileges, in regulating the important public interest of the practice
of medicine and surgery, enabled them to prescribe a course of studies, to
examine candidates in regard to their qualifications for practice, and give
letters testimonial to those who might be found duly qualified. They were
authorized to elect fellows, and vested with power to suspend, expel or disfranchise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_730'>730</span>any fellow or member, and to make rules and by-laws for their government.
No person could be a member, but by his own act in accepting the
appointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>This society was regarded by these legislative Acts as a public institution,
by the action of which the public would be deeply affected in one of its important
public interests, the health of the people. The plaintiff, by accepting his
appointment as a fellow, voluntarily submitted himself to the government and
jurisdiction of the society in his professional relations, so long as they acted
within the scope of their authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">status</span></i> or condition of being a member of this society was one of a permanent
character and recognized by law—one in which each member has a
valuable interest; and that it was so regarded by the plaintiff is manifest
from his effort to obtain a restoration to it by a judgment of this court, by a
writ of mandamus.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think it obvious that the subject-matter of the complaint—dishonorable
conduct, a fraudulent transaction between the plaintiff and another member
of the profession and of the same society—was within the scope of the
authority conferred by law on the society; and that the direction of the court,
that their action was conclusive upon the plaintiff, was correct. As to the legal
proceedings set forth in the supposed libel, it was admitted by the plaintiff’s
counsel that the account there given of those proceedings was substantially
true.</p>

<p class='c007'>If then this charge of dishonorable or fraudulent conduct by the plaintiff,
in his dealings with Dr. Carpenter, was within the jurisdiction of the medical
society, and proceedings were instituted and carried on to their final determination
in the expulsion of the plaintiff from his fellowship, then the proceedings
might be rightly characterized, as in the case of Farnsworth <em>v.</em> Storrs, as
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi</span></i> judicial; and then the only remaining question of fact was, whether the
publication was a true and correct narrative of such proceedings and determination.
This question the judge did leave, or proposed to leave, to the jury;
with the direction, that if they should find upon the evidence that that part of
the publication was true, the defendant would be entitled to a verdict. We
are of opinion that this direction was right. As the verdict was for the defendant,
we are to assume that it was found by them; or, if the verdict was
taken by consent, it would have been found under the instruction that the
publication did present a true and correct narrative of the proceedings before
the society, and their determination thereon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact, that these proceedings were considered closed and finished, takes
away from this publication the objection, that it would have a tendency to
prejudice the public mind and prevent the party affected from having a fair
trial.</p>

  <h4 class='c013'>MILISSICH <em>v.</em> LLOYD’S<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Court of Appeal, February 10, 1877.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 13 Cox, Criminal Cases, 575.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Mellish, L. J.</span><a id='r477'></a><a href='#f477' class='c015'><sup>[477]</sup></a> In this case the defendants have appealed from a
decision of the Common Pleas Division, ordering a new trial on the
ground that the verdict given for the plaintiff was against the weight
of evidence. They are not satisfied with that order, but they come
before us to have judgment entered for themselves. The question for
us is an important one, as to the power of the court to enter judgment
under the Judicature Acts. Now, although the Judicature Acts do
undoubtedly give very general powers to the court as to entering of
judgment, it is clearly not intended by the Legislature that the court
should take advantage of that general rule to remove questions from
the consideration of the jury which are questions of fact properly for
their consideration. The action was brought by the plaintiff against
Lloyd’s for an alleged libel published by Lloyd’s in a pamphlet. At
the trial, no doubt, the defence of privileged communication was
raised and Lord Coleridge expressed an opinion that Lloyd’s would
not have the same privilege as an ordinary newspaper; and he also expressed
an opinion that, inasmuch as only the speech of the prosecuting
counsel and the summing up of the judge, and not the speech of the
counsel for the defence, at the criminal trial, was published, the report
could not be a fair one of the trial. I cannot agree with either of these
doubts. I cannot think there is any difference between the privilege
attaching to a report in a newspaper or in a pamphlet, unless some
question of malice is raised. Of course, if actual malice is alleged, the
fact that the libel was published in a pamphlet and not in a newspaper
might be very material, but when no such allegation is made I cannot
conceive there is any difference. I also cannot agree that the mere
fact that the publisher did not publish the evidence in full, but only
the summing up of the judge and the speech of the prosecuting counsel,
made the report of the trial an unfair one. I think that proposition
implies that proceedings at trials cannot be reported at all unless
they are reported in full. It must, therefore, be sufficient to publish a
fair abstract of the evidence. Now, I do not know how the reporter
could do better than take the judge’s summing up to get that fair
abstract, although I do not, of course, lay down as a matter of law
that the summing up of a judge is necessarily a correct summary for
the report. I think this report may be fair or it may be unfair; but
then, is it a question of fact or law whether the report is fair or unfair?
I think that it is a question of fact, and should be left to the jury to
determine. Then the argument is that the evidence is all one way
and that it is useless sending the case down to a new trial because no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_732'>732</span>jury could reasonably find the other way. In my opinion, the court
must be very cautious not to take upon itself the functions of a jury.
Notwithstanding the great powers given by the Judicature Acts, it is
still, of course, the province of the jury to determine between the
credibility of witnesses on either side. Here, however, the question is
more what is the inference to be drawn from the facts proved in evidence.
The general inference to be drawn from all the facts, as in
Lewis <em>v.</em> Levy, E. B. &amp; E. 537, is for the jury. There the whole proceedings
before the magistrates were put in evidence, in order to judge
of the fairness of the report. Here a full shorthand note is produced,
and, being placed in the hands of the jury, they are to draw the inference,
and not the court. Now, although I think that persons might
draw very unfair inferences against a man who, like the plaintiff,
did not appear at the trial himself and could not defend himself from
the charges which were made against him on both sides, still, if the
report is a fair one of what took place the defendants will be privileged.
The question for the jury will be at the new trial—was the report a
fair one, and would it give a fair notion to people who were not there
of what took place? That question is one for the jury, and I think
the case should, therefore, be sent for a new trial.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>BARNES <em>v.</em> CAMPBELL<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New Hampshire, June, 1879.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 59 New Hampshire Reports, 128.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Case, for libel in accusing the plaintiff of crime. Plea, the general
issue, with a brief statement alleging that the defendants are conductors
and publishers of a newspaper published at, &amp;c., and as such it
was part of their duty to give to their readers such items of news as
they might properly judge to be of interest and value to the community,
and that, as such conductors and publishers, they published
the article complained of, in good faith, without malice, believing and
having good reason to believe the same to be true.</p>

<p class='c007'>Motion by the plaintiff to reject the brief statement.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Smith, J.</span> Matter in justification must be pleaded. But according
to some decisions, matter in excuse may be given in evidence under the
general issue, or be pleaded. State <em>v.</em> Burnham, 9 N. H. 34, 43, and
authorities cited; Carpenter <em>v.</em> Bailey, 53 N. H. 590. In this view of
the case, it is, perhaps, immaterial whether or not the brief statement
is defective. But, treating the brief statement and the motion to reject
it as intended to raise the question whether the brief statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_733'>733</span>sets forth a defence, we are of opinion that it does not. The defendants
probably intended to set out the excuse of a lawful occasion, good
faith, proper purpose, and belief and probable cause to believe that the
publication was true. They laid stress upon their business of publishing
a newspaper. But professional publishers of news are not exempt,
as a privileged class, from the consequences of damage done by their
false news. Their communications are not privileged merely because
made in a public journal. They have the same right to give information
that others have, and no more. Smart <em>v.</em> Blanchard, 42 N. H.
137, 151; Palmer <em>v.</em> Concord, 48 N. H. 211, 216; Sheckell <em>v.</em> Jackson,
10 Cush. 25. The occasion of the defendants’ publishing a false
charge of crime against the plaintiff was not lawful, if the end to be
attained was not to give useful information to the community of a fact
of which the community had a right to be and ought to be informed, in
order that they might act upon such information. State <em>v.</em> Burnham,
9 N. H. 34, 41, 42; Palmer <em>v.</em> Concord, 48 N. H. 211, 217; Carpenter
<em>v.</em> Bailey, 53 N. H. 590; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span> 56 N. H. 283. The defendants do not
state facts that would constitute a lawful occasion. They make a
loose averment of their general duty to give their readers such news
as they (the defendants) might properly judge to be of interest and
value to the community. This should be struck out of the record as
insufficient and misleading. It is, in effect, an intimation that they
published the libel in the usual course of their business, and is calculated
to give the jury the erroneous impression that the defendants’
judgment of the propriety of the publication is evidence of the lawfulness
of the occasion. The defendants’ general business of publishing
interesting and valuable news was not, of itself, a lawful occasion
for publishing this particular, false, and criminal charge against the
plaintiff. It will be for the jury to say what weight the defendants’
business has as evidence on the question of malice. But however high
the defendants’ vocation, and however interesting and valuable the
truth which they undertake to give their readers, their ordinary and
habitual calling is no excuse for assailing the plaintiff’s character
with this false charge of crime. They must show specific facts constituting
a lawful occasion in this particular instance, as if this false
charge had been the only thing they ever published. They allege
nothing of that kind. They do not state that the community had any
interest which would have been protected or promoted by the publication
complained of if it had been true, or had a right to be or ought
to be informed of the subject-matter of it in order that they might act
upon correct information of it, or that the information given would
have been practically useful to anybody if it had been true. This is
the substance of a lawful occasion. The brief statement contains no
specification on this point.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Libel. The declaration charged that the defendants falsely and
maliciously published of the plaintiff, their manager, in a certain report
of the affairs of the company, these words: “The shareholders
will observe that there is a charge of £1,306 1<em>s.</em> 7<em>d.</em> for deficiency of
stock, which the manager is responsible for; his accounts as such
manager in the company have been badly kept, and have been rendered
to us very irregularly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Plea: Not guilty. Issue thereon.<a id='r480'></a><a href='#f480' class='c015'><sup>[480]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It was objected on behalf of the defendants that there was no evidence
of a publication of the libel, and that it was a privileged communication.
The Chief Baron overruled the objections, but reserved
leave to the defendants to move to enter a nonsuit on both points.
The plaintiff having proved his special damage, the jury found a verdict
for £500.</p>

<p class='c007'>A rule having been obtained to enter a nonsuit pursuant to the leave
reserved,</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Holker</em>, Q. C., and <em>Gorst</em>, showed cause.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Manisty</em>, Q. C. (<em>R. C. Fisher</em> with him), in support of the rule.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mellor, J.</span> I am of opinion that the rule should be made absolute
to enter a nonsuit. Had I been able to perceive that any substantial
injustice might have been done by not leaving any question to the
jury, I should have been disposed to send the case down for a new trial.
But I think there was no evidence of express malice which ought to
have been left to the jury.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I understand the facts of the case, the plaintiff was employed as
the agent of the defendants in Egypt, and his transactions were necessarily
brought under the notice of the auditors, who are appointed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_735'>735</span>Act of Parliament, or at all events by the articles of association of the
company, and who are fit persons to investigate the accounts of
the company. The auditors considered that a deficiency in the stock
of the company was owing in some sense to the plaintiff’s default, and
they expressed that opinion in their report. It seems they did this
after having received such explanations as Mr. Bell could offer, but it
must be observed that those explanations were offered to the auditors
and not to the directors. What the directors did was this, in their
report to a meeting of the shareholders they appended the statement
which had been made to them by the auditors. There is nothing whatever
to show that the directors had any reason to doubt the truth of
that statement, and there was no evidence of any act on their part
from which malice could be inferred, and therefore I think the Chief
Baron was right in not putting the question of malice to the jury. As
to the question of intrinsic or extrinsic evidence, the report was one
which the directors were fully warranted in believing was correct; and
there is nothing to show that the directors acted otherwise than <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona
fide</span></i> in communicating it to the shareholders. No doubt the directors
are to make their report to a meeting of the shareholders, to be called
for that purpose, and it is clear that those who are absent are bound by
the acts of those who are present, but the absent shareholders are
interested in the prosperity or adversity of the company, and in knowing
all the circumstances upon which the welfare of the company
depends. It seems to me, therefore, that to print the report was a
necessary and reasonable mode of communicating it to all the shareholders,
who must be more or less numerous.</p>

<p class='c007'>This case does not fall within the rule in Cooke <em>v.</em> Wildes, 5 E. &amp; B.
328; 24 L. J. Q. B. 367. There the question of malice was properly
left to the jury, because the letter contained defamatory expressions
which were unnecessary; the defendant was not content with stating
the facts that he had heard, but he made a calumnious observation of
his own and put a gloss on the plaintiff’s conduct which was libellous.
There was therefore intrinsic evidence of malice, and that the defendant
had not acted <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>, and these questions were properly left to
the jury. I think we are bound by the cases of Somerville <em>v.</em> Hawkins
and Taylor <em>v.</em> Hawkins, 16 Q. B. 308; 20 L. J. Q. B. 313. The principle
there laid down is, that where there is no evidence of malice
the judge ought not to leave any question to the jury. Here I think
the conduct of the directors negatives malice on their part, and it is
clear that they acted <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>. I think we should be going against
what I may call progress, if we were to hold that the delivery of the
manuscript of the report to the printer, for the purpose of having it
printed, is a publication which prevents the communication from
being privileged. I also think that it was the duty of the directors to
communicate the report not only to the shareholders present at the
meeting, but to all the shareholders, and that they had an interest in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_736'>736</span>receiving it. I am glad that Mr. Holker called our attention to the
American authority, for it supports the judgment of the court. In
Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad Company <em>v.</em> Quigley,
21 Howard (Rep. Sup. Court, U. S.), 202, it was held that it was
within the course of business and employment of the president and
directors for them to investigate the conduct of their officers and
agents, and to report the result to the stockholders. It was also held,
in the absence of malice and bad faith, that the report to the shareholders
was privileged; therefore, to this extent, that case appears to
me to be an express authority. But, independently of any authority, I
am quite prepared to hold that a company, having a great number of
shareholders all interested in knowing how their officers conduct
themselves, are justified in making a communication in a printed report,
relating to the conduct of their officers, to all the shareholders,
whether present or absent, if the communication be made without
malice and <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>. The communication in this case is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i>
privileged, and there being no evidence intrinsic or extrinsic of malice,
that question was very properly not left to the jury. I think the conclusion
at which the Chief Baron arrived at <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi prius</span></i> without hearing
any argument erroneous, and with great deference to that eminent and
learned judge, I am of opinion this rule to enter a nonsuit should be
made absolute.</p>

<p class='c022'>Case for slander. The words charged to have been spoken by the defendant
imputed that the plaintiff had stolen a brooch belonging to the defendant’s
wife; and they were said to have been uttered in a discourse, &amp;c., and in the
hearing of one Jane Cole and divers, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c019'>On the trial before Parke, B., at the Hampshire summer assizes, 1838, it
appeared that the plaintiff had called at the defendant’s house, and that soon
afterwards the brooch was missed; that defendant then went to an inn, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_737'>737</span>the plaintiff was, and stated to her his suspicions, in the presence of a third
person; and that the plaintiff, with her own concurrence, was afterwards
searched by Jane Cole and another female, who were called in for the purpose
and to whom the defendant at the time repeated the charge. The brooch was
not found on the plaintiff, but was afterwards discovered to have been left by
the defendant’s wife at another place. The defendant’s counsel first applied
for a nonsuit, which the learned judge refused. The defendant’s counsel then,
in his address to the jury, contended that the words were spoken without
malice, under circumstances which privileged them. The learned judge told
the jury that the verdict must be for the plaintiff, if they thought that the
words imputed felony, for that it was clear they were not privileged. Verdict
for the plaintiff.</p>

it is clear that the judge was not warranted in withdrawing that question from
their consideration.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Littledale, J.</span> The jury were to say whether the defendant believed that
the brooch was stolen by the plaintiff, and for that reason charged her with
having stolen it, and whether his language was stronger than necessary, or
whether the charge was made before more persons than was necessary. The
law has been laid down so over and over again.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Coleridge, J.</span> For the sake of public justice, charges and communications,
which would otherwise be slanderous, are protected if <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> made in the
prosecution of an inquiry into a suspected crime. Then had not the defendant
a right to make out that case? The facts were for the jury. It is argued that
the charge ought to be true, or ought to be made only before an officer of
justice. But the exigencies of society could never permit such a restriction.
If I stop a party suspected, must not I say why I do so? Supposing it unjustifiable
to search a person against his will, here the plaintiff agreed to be
searched. The presence of other parties would not do away with the privilege.
When the two females were desired to make the search, were they not to be
told for what they were to look? The question was clearly for the jury.</p>

<p class='c014'>Case for a libel. Plea, the general issue. At the trial before Lord
Tenterden, C. J., at the Westminster sittings after Hilary term, it
appeared in evidence that the plaintiff had been in the service of the
defendants, Mrs. Affleck having before she hired her made inquiries of
two persons, who gave her a good character. The plaintiff remained
in that service a few months, and was afterwards hired by another person,
who wrote to Mrs. Affleck for her character, and received the following
answer, which was the alleged libel: “Mrs. A.’s compliments
to Mrs. S., and is sorry that in reply to her inquiries respecting E.
Child, nothing can be in justice said in her favor. She lived with Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_739'>739</span>A. but for a few weeks, in which short time she frequently conducted
herself disgracefully; and Mrs. A. is concerned to add she has, since
her dismissal, been credibly informed she has been and now is a prostitute
in Bury.” In consequence of this letter the plaintiff was dismissed
from her situation. It further appeared that after that letter
was written, Mrs. Affleck went to the persons who had recommended
the plaintiff to her, and made a similar statement to them. Upon this
evidence it was contended, for the defendants, that there was no proof
of malice, and that consequently the plaintiff must be nonsuited. On
the other hand, it was urged that Mrs. Affleck’s statement of what the
plaintiff’s conduct had been after she left her service was not privileged,
and that, at all events, that part of the letter and the statement
that she voluntarily made to other persons, and not in answer to
any inquiries, were evidence of malice. Lord Tenterden, C. J., was of
opinion that the latter part of the letter was privileged, and that the
other communications being made to persons who had recommended
the plaintiff, were not evidence of malice, and he directed a nonsuit.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>F. Kelly</em> now moved for a rule <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi</span></i> for a new trial.<a id='r484'></a><a href='#f484' class='c015'><sup>[484]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Parke, J.</span> The rule laid down by Lord Mansfield, in Edmondson <em>v.</em>
Stevenson, Bull. N. P. 8, has been followed ever since. It is, that in an
action for defamation in giving a character of a servant, “the gist of
it must be malice, which is not implied from the occasion of speaking,
but should be directly proved.” The question then is, whether the
plaintiff in this case adduced evidence, which, if laid before a jury,
could properly lead them to find express malice. That does not appear
upon the face of the letter. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prima facie</span></i> it is fair, and undoubtedly a
person asked as to the character of a servant may communicate all
that is stated in that letter. Independently of the letter, there was no
evidence except of the two persons that had recommended the plaintiff.
The communication to them, therefore, was not officious, and
Mrs. Affleck was justified in making it. In Rogers <em>v.</em> Clifton, 3 B. &amp; P.
587, evidence of the good conduct of the servant was given, and the
communication also appeared to be officious. In Blackburn <em>v.</em> Blackburn,
4 Bing. 395, the occasion of writing the alleged libel did not
distinctly appear, it was therefore properly left to the jury to say,
whether it was confidential and privileged or not, and they found that
it was not. Here the letter was undoubtedly <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> privileged,
the plaintiff, therefore, was bound to prove express malice in order to
take away the privilege.</p>

ship, and then in command of her, had been in a state of constant
drunkenness during part of the voyage, whereby the ship and crew
had been exposed to continual danger: and the publication by the
defendant was, the communication by him of this letter to the owner
of the ship, by reason whereof—which was the special damage alleged
in the declaration—the plaintiff was dismissed from the ship, and
lost his employment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant pleaded—first, not guilty; secondly, that the
charges made by the mate against the plaintiff in his letter were true;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_741'>741</span>and, lastly, that the shipowner did not dismiss the captain by reason,
and in consequence, of the communication of the letter to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the last two issues a verdict was found for the plaintiff; but,
upon the first issue, for the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>I told the jury at the trial, that the occasion and circumstances under
which the communication of this letter took place, were such, as,
in my opinion, to furnish a legal excuse for making the communication;
and that the inference of malice,—which the law <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i>
draws from the bare act of publishing any statements false in fact,
containing matter to the reproach and prejudice of another,—was
thereby rebutted; and that the plaintiff, to entitle himself to a verdict,
must show malice in fact: concluding by telling them that they should
find their verdict for the defendant, if they thought the communication
was strictly honest on his part, and made solely in the execution
of what he believed to be a duty; but, for the plaintiff, if they thought
the communication was made from any indirect motive whatever, or
from any malice against the plaintiff. And the only question now before
us, is, whether, upon the evidence given at the trial, such direction
was right.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no evidence whatever that the defendant was actuated by
any sinister motive in communicating the letter to Mr. Ward, the
shipowner: on the contrary, all the evidence went to prove that what
he did he did under the full belief that he was performing a duty, however
mistaken he might be as to the existence of such duty, or in his
mode of performing it. The writer of the letter was no stranger to
the defendant: on the contrary, both were proved to have been on
terms of friendship with each other for some years; and, from the
tenor of the letter itself, it must be inferred the defendant was a person
upon whose judgment the writer of the letter placed great reliance, the
letter itself being written for the professed purpose of obtaining his
advice how to act, under a very pressing difficulty. The letter was
framed in very artful terms, such as were calculated to induce the most
wary and prudent man (knowing the writer) to place reliance on the
truth of its details: and there can be no doubt but that the defendant
did in fact thoroughly believe the contents to be true, amongst other
things, that the ship, of which Mr. Ward was the owner, and the crew
and cargo on board the same, had been exposed to very imminent risk,
by the continued intoxication of the captain on the voyage from the
French coast to Llanelly, where the ship then was, and that the voyage
to the Eastern Seas, for which the ship was chartered, would be continually
exposed to the same hazard, if the vessel should continue
under his command. In this state of facts, after the letter had been a
few days in his hands, the defendant considered it to be his duty to
communicate its contents to Mr. Ward, whose interests were so nearly
concerned in the information; not communicating it to the public, but
to Mr. Ward; and not accompanying such disclosure with any directions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_742'>742</span>or advice, but merely putting him in possession of the facts stated
in the letter, that he might be in a condition to investigate the truth,
and take such steps as prudence and justice to the parties concerned
required: in making which disclosure he did not act hastily or unadvisedly,
but consulted two persons well qualified to give good advice
on such an emergency—the one, an Elder Brother of the Trinity
House—the other, one of the most eminent shipowners in London:
in conformity with whose advice he gave up the letter to the owner of
the ship. At the same time, if the defendant took a course which was
not justifiable in point of law, although it proceeded from an error in
judgment only, not of intention, still it is undoubtedly he, and not the
plaintiff, who must suffer for such error.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only question is, whether the case does or does not fall within
the principle, well recognized and established in the law, relating to
privileged or confidential communications; and, in determining this
question, two points may, as I conceive, be considered as settled—first,
that if the defendant had had any personal interest in the subject-matter
to which the letter related, as, if he had been a part-owner of
the ship, or an underwriter on the ship, or had had any property on
board, the communication of such a letter to Mr. Ward would have
fallen clearly within the rule relating to excusable publications—and,
secondly, that if the danger disclosed by the letter, either to the ship
or the cargo, or the ship’s company, had been so immediate as that the
disclosure to the shipowner was necessary to avert such danger, then,
upon the ground of social duty, by which every man is bound to his
neighbor, the defendant would have been not only justified in making
the disclosure, but would have been <em>bound</em> to make it. A man who
received a letter informing him that his neighbor’s house would be
plundered or burnt on the night following by A. and B., and which he
himself believed, and had reason to believe, to be true, would be justified
in showing that letter to the owner of the house, though it should
turn out to be a false accusation of A. and B. The question before us
appears, therefore, to be narrowed to the consideration of the facts
which bear upon these two particular qualifications and restrictions of
the general principle.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the first, I do not find the rule of law is so narrowed and
restricted by any authority, that a person having information materially
affecting the interests of another, and honestly communicating
it, in the full belief, and with reasonable grounds for the belief, that it
is true, will not be excused, though he has no personal interest in the
subject-matter. Such a restriction would surely operate as a great
restraint upon the performance of the various social duties by which
men are bound to each other, and by which society is kept up. In
Pattison <em>v.</em> Jones, 8 B. &amp; C. 578, the defendant, who had discharged
the plaintiff from his service, wrote a letter to the person who was
about to engage him, unsolicited; he was therefore a volunteer in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_743'>743</span>matter; and might be considered as a stranger, having no interest in
the business; but, neither at the trial, nor on the motion before the
court, was it suggested that the letter was, on that account, an unprivileged
communication; but it was left to the jury to say whether
the communication was honest or malicious. Again, in Child <em>v.</em>
Affleck and Wife, the statement, by the former mistress, of the conduct
of her servant, not only during her service, but after she had left it,
was held to be privileged. The rule appears to have been correctly
laid down by the Court of Exchequer, that, “if fairly warranted by
any reasonable occasion or exigency, and honestly made, such communications
are protected, for the common convenience and welfare of
society; and the law has not restricted the right to make them, within
any narrow limits.” 1 C. M. &amp; R. 181. In the present case, the defendant
stood in a different situation from any other person; he
was the only person in the world who had received the letter, or was
acquainted with the information contained in it. He cannot, therefore,
properly be treated as a complete stranger to the subject-matter
of inquiry, even if the rule excluded strangers from the privilege.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the second ground of qualification—was the danger sufficiently
imminent to justify the communication—it is true, that the
letter, which came to the defendant’s hands about the 14th of December,
contains within it the information that the ship cannot get out of
harbor before the end of the month. It was urged that the defendant,
instead of communicating the letter to the owner, might have instituted
some inquiry himself. But it is to be observed that every day
the ship remained under the command of such a person as the plaintiff
was described to be, the ship and crew continued exposed to hazard,
though not so great hazard as when at sea; not to mention the immediate
injury to the shipowner which must necessarily follow from
want of discipline of the crew, and the bad example of such a master.
And, after all, it would be too much to say, that, even if the thing had
been practicable, any duty was cast upon <em>the defendant</em>, to lay out his
time or money in the investigation of the charge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the consideration of the case, I think it was the duty of the
defendant not to keep the knowledge he gained by this letter himself,
and thereby make himself responsible, in conscience, if his neglect of
the warnings of the letter brought destruction upon the ship or crew—that
a prudent and reasonable man would have done the same; that
the disclosure was made, not publicly, but privately to the owner, that
is, to the person who of all the world was the best qualified, both from
his interest in the subject-matter, and his knowledge of his own officers,
to form the most just conclusion as to its truth, and to adopt the most
proper and effective measures to avert the danger; after which disclosure,
not the defendant, but the owner, became liable to the plaintiff,
if the owner took steps which were not justifiable; as, by unjustly
dismissing him from his employment, if the letter was untrue. And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_744'>744</span>as all this was done with entire honesty of purpose, and in the full belief
of the truth of the information,—and that, a reasonable belief,—I
am still of the same opinion which I entertained at the trial, that
this case ranges itself within the pale of privileged communication,
and that the action is not maintainable.</p>

<p class='c007'>I therefore think the rule for setting aside the verdict and for a new
trial, should be discharged.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Creswell, J.</span> I cannot, without much regret, express an opinion
in this case at variance with that which is entertained by my lord and
one of my learned brothers. But, having given full consideration to
the arguments urged at the bar, and the cases cited, and not being able
to shake off the impression which they made in favor of the plaintiff, I
am bound to act upon the opinion that I have formed. I will not repeat
the facts of the case, which have been already stated, but proceed
shortly to explain the grounds upon which my opinion rests.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no doubt that the letter published by the defendant of the
plaintiff was defamatory; and the truth of its contents could not be
proved. The plaintiff was, therefore, entitled to maintain an action
against the publisher of that letter, unless the occasion on which it was
published made the publication of such letter a lawful act, as far as the
plaintiff was concerned, if done in good faith, and without actual
malice. To sustain an action for a libel or slander, the plaintiff must
show that it was malicious; but every unauthorized publication of
defamatory matter is, in point of law, to be considered as malicious.
The law, however, on a principle of policy and convenience, authorizes
many communications, although they affect the characters of individuals;
and I take it to be a question of law, whether the communication
is authorized or not. If it be authorized, the legal presumption
of malice arising from the unauthorized publication of
defamatory matter, fails, and the plaintiff, to sustain his action, must
prove actual malice, or, as it is usually expressed, malice in fact. In
the present case, the existence of malice in fact was negatived by the
jury; and if my lord was right in telling them, that, in the absence of
malice in fact, the publication of the letter was privileged, this rule
should be discharged. It therefore becomes necessary to inquire
within what limits and boundaries the law authorizes the publication
of defamatory matter. Perhaps the best description of those limits
and boundaries that can be given in few words, is to be found in the
judgment of Parke, B., in Toogood <em>v.</em> Spyring: “The law considers
such publication as malicious, unless it is fairly made by a person in the
discharge of some public or private duty, whether legal or moral, or
in the conduct of his own affairs in matters where his interest is concerned.”
It was not contended in this case that any <em>legal</em> duty bound
the defendant to communicate to the shipowner the contents of the
letter he had received, nor was the communication made in the conduct
of his own affairs, nor was his interest concerned: the authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_745'>745</span>for the publication, if any, must therefore be derived from some <em>moral</em>
duty, public or private, which it was incumbent upon him to discharge.
I think it impossible to say that the defendant was called upon by any
<em>public duty</em> to make the communication; neither his own situation
nor that of any of the parties concerned, nor the interests at stake
were such as to affect the public weal. Was there then any <em>private</em>
duty? There was no relation of principal and agent between the shipowner
and the defendant, nor was any trust or confidence reposed by
the former in the latter; there was no relationship or intimacy between
them; no inquiries had been made; they were, until the time
in question, strangers: the duty, if it existed at all as between them,
must, therefore, have arisen from the mere circumstance of their being
fellow-subjects of the realm. But the same relation existed between
the defendant and the plaintiff. If the property of the shipowner on
the one hand was at stake, the character of the captain was at stake
on the other; and I cannot but think that the moral duty not to publish
of the latter defamatory matter which he did not <em>know</em> to be true,
was quite as strong as the duty to communicate to the shipowner that
which he <em>believed</em> to be true. Was, then, the defendant bound by any
moral duty towards the writer of the letter, to make the communication?
Surely not. If the captain had misconducted himself, the
mate was capable of observing it, and was as capable of communicating
it to the owner as to the defendant. The crew were, in like manner,
capable of observing and acting for themselves. The mate (if he really
believed that which he wrote to be true) might, indeed, be under a
moral duty to communicate it to his owner: but the defendant had no
right to take that vicarious duty upon himself: he was not requested
by the mate to do so, but was, on the contrary, enjoined <em>not</em> to make
the communication.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will not attempt to comment upon the very numerous cases that
were quoted at the bar on the one side and on the other, but will advert
to one or two which tend to explain the term “moral duty,” and see
whether it has ever been held to authorize the publication of defamatory
matter under circumstances similar to those which exist in the
present case. In Bromage <em>v.</em> Prosser, Bayley, J., in his very elaborate
judgment, speaks of slander as “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> excusable on account of
the cause of speaking or writing it, in the case of servants’ characters,
confidential advice, or communications to those who ask it or have a
right to expect it.” With regard to the characters of servants and
agents, it is so manifestly for the advantage of society that those who
are about to employ them should be enabled to learn what their previous
conduct has been, that it may be well deemed the moral duty of
former employers to answer inquiries to the best of their belief. But,
according to the opinion of the same learned judge, intimated in
Pattison <em>v.</em> Jones, 8 B. &amp; C. 578, it is necessary that <em>inquiry</em> should be
made, in order to render lawful the communication of defamatory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_746'>746</span>matter, although he was also of opinion that such inquiry may be
invited by the former master. And in Rogers <em>v.</em> Clifton, Chambre, J.,
quoted a similar opinion of Lord Mansfield’s, expressed in Lowry <em>v.</em>
Aikenhead, Mich. 8 G. 3, 3 B. &amp; P. 594.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was contended during the argument of this case, that the protection
given to masters when speaking of the conduct of servants, was
more extensive, and applied also to communications made to former
employers; and Child <em>v.</em> Affleck was mentioned as an instance. But
the communication to the former master was not made a ground of
action in that case, and was introduced only as evidence that the statement
made in answer to the inquiry of the new master was malicious.
The same observation applies to Rogers <em>v.</em> Clifton; and it may be
collected from that report that Chambre, J., was of opinion, that,
where statements are made which are not in answer to inquiries, the
defendant must plead, and prove, a justification.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, where a party asks advice or information upon a subject on
which he is interested; or where the relative position of two parties
is such that the one has a right to expect confidential information and
advice from the other; it may be a moral duty to answer such inquiries
and give such information and advice; and the statements
made may be rendered lawful by the occasion, although defamatory of
some third person, as in Dunman <em>v.</em> Bigg, 1 Campb. 269, and Todd <em>v.</em>
Hawkins, 2 M. &amp; Rob. 20, 8 C. &amp; P. 88.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two cases—Herver <em>v.</em> Dowson, Bull. N. P. 8, and Cleaver <em>v.</em> Sarraude,
reported in M’Dougall <em>v.</em> Claridge, 1 Campb. 268—were
quoted as authorities for giving a more extended meaning to the term
“moral duty,” and making it include all cases where one man had
information, which, if true, it would be important for another to
know. But the notes of those cases are very short: in the former the
precise circumstances under which the statement was made—see
King <em>v.</em> Watts, 8 C. &amp; P. 614, that such a statement made <em>without
inquiry</em> is not lawful—and in the latter, the position of the defendant
with reference to the Bishop of Durham, to whom it was made, are
left unexplained. I cannot, therefore, consider them as satisfactory
authorities for the position to establish which they were quoted: and,
in the absence of any clear and precise authority in favor of it, I
cannot persuade myself that it is correct, as, if established at all, it
must be at the expense of another moral duty, viz., not to publish
defamatory matter unless you <em>know</em> it to be true.</p>

<p class='c007'>For these reasons, I am of opinion, that the rule for a new trial
should be made absolute.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court being thus divided in opinion, the rule for a new trial fell
to the ground, and the defendant retained his verdict.<a id='r487'></a><a href='#f487' class='c015'><sup>[487]</sup></a></p>

  <h4 class='c013'>JOANNES <em>v.</em> BENNETT<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, October, 1862.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 5 Allen, 169.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Tort brought on the 12th of June, 1860, in the name of “The
Count Joannes (born ‘George Jones’)”<a id='r488'></a><a href='#f488' class='c015'><sup>[488]</sup></a> for two libels upon him
contained in letters to a woman to whom he was then a suitor, and was
afterwards married, endeavoring to dissuade her from entering into
the marriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial in this court, before Merrick, J., it appeared that the
defendant had for several years held the relation of pastor to the parents
of the woman, as members of his church, and to the daughter, as
a member of his choir; and there was evidence tending to show that
he was on the most intimate terms of friendship with the parents, and
that, on the 18th of May, 1860, being on a visit from his present residence
in Lockport, New York, he called upon the father at his place of
business in Boston, and was urged by him to accompany him to his
residence in South Boston, the father stating that both he and his wife
were in great distress of mind and anxiety about their daughter, and
that they feared she would engage herself in marriage to the plaintiff.
On their way to South Boston, the father stated to the defendant
what he and his wife had heard and apprehended about the plaintiff,
and their views with regard to his being an unsuitable match for their
daughter, who, with a young child by a former husband, was living
with them. On reaching the house, it was found that the daughter
had gone out; and it was then arranged that the defendant should
write a letter, and materials for that purpose were furnished, and the
letter set forth in the first count<a id='r489'></a><a href='#f489' class='c015'><sup>[489]</sup></a> was written, addressed to the daughter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_748'>748</span>and left open and unsealed with the mother, after the principal
portion of it had been read aloud at the tea-table in the presence of
the parents and a confidential friend of the family. On leaving, the
defendant was further requested to do what he thought best to induce
the daughter to break up the match.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judge ruled that the letter was not a privileged communication;
and a verdict was returned for the plaintiff. The defendant alleged
exceptions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bigelow, C. J.</span> The doctrine, that the cause or occasion of a publication
of defamatory matter may afford a sufficient justification in an
action for damages, has been stated in the form of a legal rule or canon,
which has been sanctioned by high judicial authority. The statement
is this: A communication made <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> upon any subject-matter in
which the party communicating has an interest, or in reference to
which he has a duty to perform, is privileged, if made to a person
having a corresponding interest or duty, although it contains defamatory
matter, which without such privilege would be libellous and actionable.
It would be difficult to state the result of judicial decisions
on this subject, and of the principles on which they rest, in a more
concise, accurate and intelligible form. Harrison <em>v.</em> Bush, 5 E. &amp; B.
344; Gassett <em>v.</em> Gilbert, 6 Gray, 94, and cases cited. It seems to us
very clear that the defendant in the present case fails to show any
facts or circumstances in his own relation to the parties, or in the motives
or inducements by which he was led to write the letter set out in
the first count of the declaration, which bring the publication within
the first branch of this rule. He certainly had no interest of his own
to serve or protect in making a communication concerning the character,
occupation and conduct of the plaintiff, containing defamatory
or libellous matter. It does not appear that the proposed marriage
which the letter written by the defendant was intended to discountenance
and prevent, could in any way interfere with or disturb his
personal or social relations. It did not even involve any sacrifice of
his feelings or injury to his affections. The person to whom the letter
was addressed was not connected with him by the ties of consanguinity
or kindred. It is not shown that he had any peculiar interest in
her welfare. Under such circumstances, without indicating the state
of facts which might afford a justification for the use of defamatory
words, it is plain that the defendant held no such relation towards the
parties as to give him any interest in the subject-matter to which his
communication concerning the plaintiff related. Todd <em>v.</em> Hawkins,
2 M. &amp; Rob. 20; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span> 8 C. &amp; P. 88. No doubt, he acted from laudable
motives in writing it. But these do not of themselves afford a legal
justification for holding up the character of a person to contempt and
ridicule. Good intentions do not furnish a valid excuse for violating
another’s rights, or give impunity to those who cast unjust imputations
on private character.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_749'>749</span>It is equally clear that the defendant did not write and publish the
alleged libellous communications in the exercise of any legal or moral
duty. He stood in no such relation towards the parties as to confer
on him a right or impose on him an obligation to write a letter containing
calumnious statements concerning the plaintiff’s character. Whatever
may be the rule which would have been applicable under similar
circumstances while he retained his relation of religious teacher and
pastor towards the person to whom this letter in question was addressed,
and towards her parents, he certainly had no duty resting
upon him after that relation had terminated. He then stood in no
other attitude towards the parties than as a friend. His duty to render
them a service was no greater or more obligatory than was his
duty to refrain from uttering and publishing slanderous or libellous
statements concerning another. It is obvious that if such communications
could be protected merely on the ground that the party making
them held friendly relations with those to whom they were written
or spoken, a wide door would be left open by which indiscriminate
aspersion of private character could escape with impunity. Indeed, it
would rarely be difficult for a party to shelter himself from the consequences
of uttering or publishing a slander or libel under a privilege
which could be readily made to embrace almost every species of communication.
The law does not tolerate any such license of speech or
pen. The duty of avoiding the use of defamatory words cannot be set
aside except when it is essential to the protection of some substantial
private interest, or to the discharge of some other paramount and
urgent duty. It seems to us, therefore, that on the question of justification
set up by the defendant under a supposed privilege which
authorized him to write the letter set out in the first count, the instructions
of the court were correct.<a id='r490'></a><a href='#f490' class='c015'><sup>[490]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Tort for a libel contained in letters written by the defendant to the
plaintiff’s husband, and charging her with having been guilty of dishonorable

<p class='c007'>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $30,000;
and the defendant alleged exceptions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_750'>750</span><span class='sc'>Field, J.</span> The exceptions also state, that the court refused “to
instruct the jury that each of the letters mentioned in plaintiff’s declaration
was a privileged communication, and that this action could
not therefore be maintained,” and “instructed the jury that no privilege
was shown.” No facts are recited in the bill of exceptions which
tend to show that the occasion was privileged, except such as may be
inferred from the relation of the parties to each other, and from the
contents of the letters. Taking the case most favorably for the defendant,
it is that the plaintiff owed a debt to the defendant for money lent
to her before her marriage, which, after her marriage with a rich man,
she refused to pay, under circumstances which showed ingratitude on
her part, and that the defendant wrote a letter to the husband defamatory
of the plaintiff, for the purpose of compelling him or her to pay
the debt. This is not a lawful method of collecting a debt, or of compelling
another person than the debtor to pay it. The defendant owed
no duty to the husband to inform him of the bad conduct of his wife
before her marriage, and the husband was under no obligation to pay
the debts of his wife contracted before her marriage. There is no
evidence that the defendant in sending the letter to the husband was
acting in the discharge of any duty, social, moral, or legal. The
ruling was right. Gassett <em>v.</em> Gilbert, 6 Gray, 94; Krebs <em>v.</em> Oliver, 12

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Parke, B.</span><a id='r493'></a><a href='#f493' class='c015'><sup>[493]</sup></a> In this case, which was argued before my Brothers <span class='sc'>Bolland</span>,
<span class='sc'>Alderson</span>, <span class='sc'>Gurney</span>, and myself, a motion was made for a nonsuit,
or a new trial, on the ground of misdirection. It was an action of
slander, for words alleged to be spoken of the plaintiff as a journeyman
carpenter, on three different occasions. It appeared that the defendant,
who was a tenant of the Earl of Devon, required some work to be
done on the premises occupied by him under the earl, and the plaintiff,
who was generally employed by Brinsdon, the earl’s agent, as a journeyman,
was sent by him to do the work. He did it, but in a negligent
manner; and, during the progress of the work, got drunk; and some
circumstances occurred which induced the defendant to believe that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_751'>751</span>had broken open the cellar door, and so obtained access to his cider.
The defendant a day or two afterwards met the plaintiff in the presence
of a person named Taylor, and charged him with having broken
open his cellar door with a chisel, and also with having got drunk.
The plaintiff denied the charges. The defendant then said he would
have it cleared up, and went to look for Brinsdon; he afterwards returned
and spoke to Taylor, in the absence of the plaintiff; and, in
answer to a question of Taylor’s, said he was confident that the plaintiff
had broken open the door. On the same day the defendant saw
Brinsdon, and complained to him that the plaintiff had been negligent
in his work, had got drunk, and he thought he had broken open
the door, and requested him to go with him in order to examine it.
Upon the trial it was objected, that these were what are usually termed
“privileged communications.” The learned judge thought that the
statement to Brinsdon might be so, but not the charge made in the
presence of Taylor; and in respect of that charge, and of what was
afterwards said to Taylor, both which statements formed the subject
of the action, the plaintiff had a verdict. We agree in his opinion, that
the communication to Brinsdon was protected, and that the statement,
upon the second meeting, to Taylor, in the plaintiff’s absence,
was not; but we think, upon consideration, that the statement made
to the plaintiff, though in the presence of Taylor, falls within the class
of communications ordinarily called privileged; that is, cases where
the occasion of the publication affords a defence in the absence of express
malice. In general, an action lies for the malicious publication
of statements which are false in fact, and injurious to the character of
another (within the well-known limits as to verbal slander), and the
law considers such publication as malicious, unless it is fairly made
by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty, whether
legal or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters where
his interest is concerned. In such cases, the occasion prevents the
inference of malice, which the law draws from unauthorized communications,
and affords a qualified defence depending upon the absence
of actual malice. If <em>fairly</em> warranted by any reasonable occasion
or exigency, and honestly made, such communications are protected
for the common convenience and welfare of society; and the law has
not restricted the right to make them within any narrow limits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the many cases which have been reported on this subject,
one precisely in point has not, I believe, occurred; but one of the most
ordinary and common instances in which the principle has been applied
in practice is that of a former master giving the character of a
discharged servant; and I am not aware that it was ever deemed
essential to the protection of such a communication that it should be
made to some person interested in the inquiry, <em>alone</em>, and not in the
presence of a third person. If made with honesty of purpose to a party
who has any interest in the inquiry (and that has been very liberally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_752'>752</span>construed, Child <em>v.</em> Affleck, 4 Man. &amp; Ryl. 590; 9 B. &amp; C. 403), the
simple fact that there has been some casual bystander cannot alter
the nature of the transaction. The business of life could not be well
carried on if such restraints were imposed upon this and similar communications,
and if, on every occasion in which they were made, they
were not protected unless strictly private. In this class of communications
is, no doubt, comprehended the right of a master <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> to
charge his servant for any supposed misconduct in his service, and to
give him admonition and blame; and we think that the simple circumstance
of the master exercising that right in the presence of another,
does by no means of <em>necessity</em> take away from it the protection
which the law would otherwise afford. Where, indeed, an opportunity
is <em>sought</em> for making such a charge before third persons, which might
have been made in private, it would afford strong evidence of a malicious
intention, and thus deprive it of that immunity which the law
allows to such a statement, when made with honesty of purpose; but
the mere fact of a third person being present does not render the communication
absolutely unauthorized, though it may be a circumstance
to be left with others, including the style and character of the language
used, to the consideration of the jury, who are to determine whether
the defendant has acted <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> in making the charge, or been influenced
by malicious motives.<a id='r494'></a><a href='#f494' class='c015'><sup>[494]</sup></a> In the present case, the defendant stood
in such a relation with respect to the plaintiff, though not strictly that
of master, as to authorize him to impute blame to him, provided it was
done fairly and honestly, for any supposed misconduct in the course
of his employment; and we think that the fact, that the imputation
was made in Taylor’s presence, does not, <em>of itself</em>, render the communication
unwarranted and officious, but at most is a circumstance
to be left to the consideration of the jury. We agree with the learned
judge, that the statement to Taylor, in the plaintiff’s absence, was
unauthorized and officious, and therefore not protected, although
made in the belief of its truth, if it were, in point of fact, false; but,
inasmuch as no damages have been separately given upon this part of
the charge alone, to which the fourth count is adapted, we cannot
support a general verdict, if the learned judge was wrong in his opinion
as to the statement to the plaintiff in Taylor’s presence; and, as
we think that at all events it should have been left to the jury whether
the defendant acted maliciously or not on that occasion, there must be
a new trial.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>This was an action for a libel, tried before Brett, J., at the last
assizes for Leicester. The facts were as follows: The plaintiff was
employed as assistant in the shop of the defendant, a shoemaker, at
Leicester. The defendant having accused the plaintiff of robbing
him of money, sent two post-office telegrams to her father, who resided
in London, to inform him of his suspicions. The first telegram was to
this effect: “Come at once to Leicester, if you wish to save your child
from appearing before a magistrate.” The second was as follows:
“Your child will be given in charge of the police unless you reply and
come to-day. She has taken money out of the till.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The charge was persisted in down to the trial; but there was no evidence
to support it. It did not appear that, beyond the officials of
the post-office, through whose hands the telegrams passed, they had
come to the knowledge of any other persons than the father, mother,
and brother of the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned judge left it to the jury to say whether the statements
were libellous, and whether it was reasonable to transmit them by telegraph
rather than by post.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury found that the statements were libellous, and that it was
not reasonable to send them by telegraph, and they returned a verdict
for the plaintiff, damages £100.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_754'>754</span><em>O’Malley, Q. C.</em> (with him <em>Merewether</em>), pursuant to leave, moved
to enter a verdict for the defendant.<a id='r496'></a><a href='#f496' class='c015'><sup>[496]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Brett, J.</span> I reserved the point because I thought it was a very important
one. It is whether, where a communication is to be made to a
relative of a person against whom a charge is preferred, which communication
would be privileged if sent by letter in the ordinary way
the privilege is not lost by sending it in the form of a telegram,—whether
a communication in that form can be said to be made to one
person, when in point of fact it passes through several hands before it
reaches its ultimate destination. Privilege is not wanted unless the
publication is libellous. The question then is whether the character of
an innocent person is to be destroyed because the libeller thinks fit to
send the libel in this shape rather than in a sealed letter. I do not
mean to say that there was malice in fact here. But I agree with my
Lord that sending the messages by telegraph when they might have
been sent by letter was evidence of malice. I desire, however, to put
this higher. I think that a communication which would be privileged
if made by letter becomes unprivileged if sent through the telegraph
office, because it is necessarily communicated to all the clerks through
whose hands it passes. It is like the case of a libel contained on the
back of a post card.<a id='r497'></a><a href='#f497' class='c015'><sup>[497]</sup></a> It was never meant by the Legislature that these
facilities for postal and telegraphic communication should be used for
the purpose of more easily disseminating libels. Where there is such
a publication, it avoids the privilege, because it is communicated
through unprivileged persons. As to the damages, I am not at all disposed
to think them excessive. The charge against the plaintiff was
of a very grave character. It was made with considerable severity,
and it was insisted upon even down to the trial.</p>

  <h4 class='c013'>MARKS <em>v.</em> BAKER<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Minnesota, July 25, 1881.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 28 Minnesota Reports, 162.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Berry, J.</span> This is an action for libel. The plaintiff was, at the times hereinafter
mentioned, treasurer of the city of Mankato, and, as such, custodian
of the moneys, and from April 1 to 6, 1880, a candidate for re-election to the
same office, at an election fixed for the latter day. The defendants were residents
and tax-payers of the city, and publishers thereat of the Mankato Free
Press, a weekly newspaper, and as such they published therein, on April 2,
1880, the article complained of, in which, as the plaintiff claims in his complaint,
they charged and intended to charge the defendant as treasurer with
embezzling city funds. It is alleged in the complaint that the matter charged
as libellous was of and concerning the plaintiff in his office—that it was false
and defamatory, and that the publication was malicious. The answer denies
malice, all intent to injure or defame plaintiff, any intention on defendants’
part to charge him with embezzlement, and alleges that defendants published
the article complained of, as a communication, solely for the purpose of calling
the attention of the public to the matter therein referred to, viz., to a discrepancy
in certain official reports tending to show that the plaintiff had failed to
charge himself with the full amount of city funds which he had received from
the county treasury, and with the view of obtaining an inquiry as to the cause
of such discrepancy. The answer further alleges that “the publication was
made in good faith;&#160;... that defendants believed that there was reasonable
cause for the publication;” and “that they were then and there discharging a
sacred and moral obligation as&#160;... editors and publishers.” The reply puts
these allegations of the answer in issue. Upon the trial it was admitted that,
notwithstanding the discrepancy, (which in fact, existed) the plaintiff had
accounted for the full sum received by him as city treasurer from the county
treasurer, so that the defendants’ charge or insinuation to the contrary was
false.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant, Baker, having been called for the defence, was asked the questions
following, to which he made answers as follows, all against the objection
and exception of the plaintiff:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) “Did you believe the report of the city recorder to be true? <em>Answer.</em>
I did believe it to be true. (This report was that from which, as defendants in
the alleged libel charged or insinuated, it appeared that plaintiff had failed to
account for all the money received by him from the county treasurer.)</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) “What was your object in publishing the article? <em>Answer.</em> I published
it for the general public interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) “Did you have any other object in publishing the article? <em>Answer.</em> I
did not.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_756'>756</span>(4) “You have stated that you had no other purpose than doing a public
duty in publishing the article. I want to know what your object was,—to
charge somebody with a crime, or whether you had some other object? <em>Answer.</em>
To draw attention to the discrepancy of the two reports. I had seen
what purported to be the official report of the county auditor, and I had seen
the city recorder’s; and the county auditor’s showed that Marks, as city treasurer,
had received from the county, during the fiscal year, $115.02 more than
the city recorder’s report showed that he had received from the county for the
same time. (These are the two reports between which the discrepancy was
charged to exist.)</p>

<p class='c007'>(5) “Did you, by publishing the article, intend to charge the plaintiff with
embezzling any sum whatever?” <em>Answer.</em> “I did not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The defence set up in the answer is, in effect, that the publication complained
of is a privileged communication.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rule is that a communication made in good faith upon any subject-matter
in which the party communicating has an interest, or in reference to
which he has a duty, public or private, either legal, moral, or social, if made to
a person having a corresponding interest or duty, is privileged; that in such
case the inference of malice which the law draws from defamatory words is rebutted,
and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">onus</span></i> of proving actual malice is cast upon the person claiming
to have been defamed. Toogood <em>v.</em> Spyring, 1 Cr. M. &amp; R. 181; 2 Addison on
Torts, § 1091; Harrison <em>v.</em> Bush, 5 E. &amp; B. 544; Moak’s Underhill on Torts,
146; Quinn <em>v.</em> Scott, 22 Minn. 456. That the subject-matter of the communication
is one of public interest in the community of which the parties to the
communication are members, is sufficient, as respects interest, to confer the
privilege. Purcell <em>v.</em> Sowler, 2 C. P. D. 215; Palmer <em>v.</em> City of Concord, 48
N. H. 211; Cooley on Torts, 217. The subject-matter of the communication
in the case at bar was one of public interest in the city of Mankato, where the
publication was made, and one in which the defendants had an interest as
residents and tax-payers of the city. It was, therefore, a privileged communication,
within the rule mentioned, if made in good faith.<a id='r499'></a><a href='#f499' class='c015'><sup>[499]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Braley, J.</span><a id='r501'></a><a href='#f501' class='c015'><sup>[501]</sup></a> The evidence would have amply warranted the jury
in finding that the defendant Papineau as priest in charge declined to
administer to the plaintiff the rite of “Holy Communion” or to permit
her to partake thereof, and that by his authority and order she
had been refused admission on the Lord’s Day to the building in which
religious services were being held. It is contended that for these acts
he and the defendant Lawrence, bishop of the diocese, are responsible
in damages, and that the verdicts in their favor were ordered wrongly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The record shows that the Protestant Episcopal Church of America,
of which the parties are members, has a body of canons or ecclesiastical
law of its own, by which the plaintiff upon baptism and confirmation
agreed to be bound, and under which her rights of worship must be
determined. Fitzgerald <em>v.</em> Robinson, 112 Mass. 371. Grosvenor <em>v.</em>
United Society of Believers, 118 Mass. 78. By the “Rubric in the
Order for the Administration of the Lord’s Supper, or Holy Communion”
the “minister” is given authority to refuse the rite to any
one whom he knows “to be an open and notorious evil liver, or to
have done any wrong to his neighbors by word or deed.” By “Canon
40. Of Regulations Respecting the Laity,” Section II, “When a person
to whom the Sacraments of the Church have been refused, or who
has been repelled from the Holy Communion under the Rubrics, shall
lodge a complaint with the Bishop, it shall be the duty of the Bishop,
unless he see fit to require the person to be admitted or restored because
of the insufficiency of the cause assigned by the Minister, to
institute such an inquiry as may be directed by the Canons of the Diocese
or Missionary District, and should no such Canon exist, the
Bishop shall proceed according to such principles of law and equity
as will insure an impartial decision, but no Minister of this Church
shall be required to admit to the Sacraments a person so refused or
repelled, without the written direction of the Bishop.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff has not availed herself of this right of appeal to the
only personage having the requisite ecclesiastical authority to review
her standing as a member and communicant or to pass upon her ceremonial
rights in accordance with the principles of “law and equity.”
Grosvenor <em>v.</em> United Society of Believers, 118 Mass. 78, 91. The
letter of her counsel to the bishop, to which no reply appears to have
been made, cannot be considered as an appeal which had been denied.
It contains only recitals of all her grievances, for the rectification of
which his friendly intercession is requested.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_758'>758</span>But if an appeal had been taken properly and the decision had been
adverse, the plaintiff would have been remediless, for in this Commonwealth
her religious rights as a communicant are not enforceable in the
civil courts. Fitzgerald <em>v.</em> Robinson, 112 Mass. 371, 379. Canadian
Religious Association <em>v.</em> Parmenter, 180 Mass. 415, 420, 421. For
the same reason it is unnecessary to decide whether at common law, as
the plaintiff contends, a member of the Church of England could sue
if unjustifiably denied participation in the communion. See Rex <em>v.</em>
Dibdin, [1910] P. D. 57; Thompson <em>v.</em> Dibdin, [1912] A. C. 533.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor can the action be maintained for defamation. Undoubtedly
she suffered mental distress, and the omission was in the presence of
the other communicants. The plaintiff, however, was not publicly
declared to be “an open and notorious evil liver,” or to be a person
who had done wrong to her neighbors by word or deed. The act of
“passing her by” without comment was within the discipline or
ecclesiastical polity of the church and does not constitute actionable
defamation of character. Farnsworth <em>v.</em> Storrs, 5 Cush. 412, 415.
Fitzgerald <em>v.</em> Robinson, 112 Mass. 371. Morasse <em>v.</em> Brochu, 151 Mass.
567. See R. L. c. 36, §§ 2, 3.</p>

<p class='c007'>The action for exclusion from the church building also must fail.
It appears that upon being informed by the constable employed for
the purpose that she could not enter the plaintiff made no attempt to
pass, but acquiesced and obeyed the order. The elements of an assault
are absent. No intimidation was used, or unjustifiable coercion exercised.
By Canon 16, to which the plaintiff subjected herself, control
of the worship and spiritual jurisdiction of the mission, including the
use of the building for religious services, was in Papineau as the
minister in charge, “subject to the authority of the Bishop.”<a id='r502'></a><a href='#f502' class='c015'><sup>[502]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Motion by the plaintiffs for a new trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial before Day, J., with a jury, it appeared that the plaintiffs
were members of a partnership firm of R. &amp; J. Pullman, in which
there were three other partners. The place of business of the firm
was No. 17, Greek Street, Soho. The plaintiffs were the owners of
some property in the Borough Road, which they had contracted in
1887 to sell to Messrs. Day &amp; Martin. The plaintiffs remained in
possession of the property for some time, and agreed to let a hoarding,
which was erected upon the property, at a rent to the defendants, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_759'>759</span>were advertising agents, for the display of advertisements. In 1889
a dispute arose between the plaintiffs and Day &amp; Martin, who were
building upon the land, as to which of the two were entitled to the
rent of the hoarding; and on September 14, 1889, the defendants,
after some prior correspondence, wrote the following letter:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c023'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Messrs. Pullman &amp; Co., 17, Greek Street, Soho.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Re</span></i> Boro’ Road.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>“Dear Sirs,—We must call your serious attention to this matter.
The builders state distinctly that you had no right to this money whatever;
consequently it has been obtained from us under false pretences.
We await your reply by return of post.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c023'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“Yours faithfully,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This letter was dictated by the defendants’ managing director to a
shorthand clerk, who transcribed it by a type-writing machine. This
type-written letter was then signed by the managing director, and,
having been press-copied by an office-boy, was sent by post in an
envelope addressed to Messrs. Pullman &amp; Co., 17, Greek Street, Soho.
The defendants did not know that there were any other partners in the
firm besides the plaintiffs. The letter was opened by a clerk of the firm
in the ordinary course of business, and was read by two other clerks.
The plaintiffs brought this action for libel. The defendants contended
that there was no publication, and that, if there were, the occasion
was privileged. The learned judge held that there was no publication,
that the occasion was privileged, and that there was no evidence of
malice. He therefore nonsuited the plaintiffs.<a id='r503'></a><a href='#f503' class='c015'><sup>[503]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Esher, M. R.</span> Two points were decided by the learned judge:
(1) that there had been no publication of the letter which is alleged
to be a libel; (2) that, if there had been publication, the occasion was
privileged. The question whether the letter is or is not a libel is for
the jury, if it is capable of being considered an imputation on the
character of the plaintiffs. If there is a new trial, it will be open to the
jury to consider whether there is a libel, and what the damages are.
The learned judge withdrew the case from the jury.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first question is, whether, assuming the letter to contain defamatory
matter, there has been a publication of it. What is the
meaning of “publication”? The making known the defamatory
matter after it has been written to some person other than the person
of whom it is written. If the statement is sent straight to the person of
whom it is written, there is no publication of it; for you cannot publish
a libel of a man to himself. If there was no publication, the question
whether the occasion was privileged does not arise. If a letter is
not communicated to any one but the person to whom it is written,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_760'>760</span>there is no publication of it. And, if the writer of a letter locks it up in
his own desk, and a thief comes and breaks open the desk and takes
away the letter and makes its contents known, I should say that would
not be a publication. If the writer of a letter shows it to his own clerk
in order that the clerk may copy it for him, is that a publication of the
letter? Certainly it is showing it to a third person; the writer cannot
say to the person to whom the letter is addressed, “I have shown it
to you and to no one else.” I cannot, therefore, feel any doubt that,
if the writer of a letter shows it to any person other than the person
to whom it is written, he publishes it. If he wishes not to publish it,
he must, so far as he possibly can, keep it to himself, or he must send
it himself straight to the person to whom it is written. There was,
therefore, in this case a publication to the type-writer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then arises the question of privilege, and that is, whether the occasion
on which the letter was published was a privileged occasion. An
occasion is privileged when the person who makes the communication
has a moral duty to make it to the person to whom he does make it,
and the person who receives it has an interest in hearing it. Both
these conditions must exist in order that the occasion may be privileged.
An ordinary instance of a privileged occasion is in the giving
a character of a servant. It is not the legal duty of the master to
give a character to the servant, but it is his moral duty to do so; and
the person who receives the character has an interest in having it.
Therefore, the occasion is privileged, because the one person has a
duty and the other has an interest. The privilege exists as against
the person who is libelled; it is not a question of privilege as between
the person who makes and the person who receives the communication;
the privilege is as against the person who is libelled. Can the
communication of the libel by the defendants in the present case to
the type-writer be brought within the rule of privilege as against the
plaintiffs—the persons libelled? What interest had the type-writer
in hearing or seeing the communication? Clearly, she had none.
Therefore, the case does not fall within the rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then again, as to the publication at the other end—I mean when
the letter was delivered. The letter was not directed to the plaintiffs
in their individual capacity; it was directed to a firm of which they
were members. The senders of the letter no doubt believed that it
would go to the plaintiffs; but it was directed to a firm. When the
letter arrived it was opened by a clerk in the employment of the plaintiffs’
firm, and was seen by three of the clerks in their office. If the
letter had been directed to the plaintiffs in their private capacity, in
all probability it would not have been opened by a clerk. But mercantile
firms and large tradesmen generally depute some clerk to open
business letters addressed to them. The sender of the letter had put
it out of his own control, and he had directed it in such a manner that
it might possibly be opened by a clerk of the firm to which it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_761'>761</span>addressed. I agree that under such circumstances there was a publication
of the letter by the sender of it, and in this case also the occasion
was not privileged for the same reasons as in the former case.
There were, therefore, two publications of the letter, and neither of
them was privileged. And, there being no privilege, no evidence of
express malice was required; the publication of itself implied malice.
I think the learned judge was misled. I do not think that the necessities
or the luxuries of business can alter the law of England. If a
merchant wishes to write a letter containing defamatory matter, and
to keep a copy of the letter, he had better make the copy himself. If
a company have deputed a person to write a letter containing libellous
matter on their behalf, they will be liable for his acts. He ought to
write such a letter himself, and to copy it himself, and, if he copies it
into a book, he ought to keep the book in his own custody.<a id='r504'></a><a href='#f504' class='c015'><sup>[504]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I think there ought to be a new trial.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>STEVENS <em>v.</em> SAMPSON<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Court of Appeal, November 15, 1879.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 5 Exchequer Division Reports, 53.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Claim for falsely and maliciously printing and publishing of the
plaintiff certain words in certain newspapers. The libel set out in the
claim was a report, published by the defendant, of certain proceedings
in a plaint of Nettlefold <em>v.</em> Fulcher, tried at the Marylebone county
court, and brought to recover damages and costs sustained by Nettlefold
in setting aside certain proceedings instituted by Fulcher against
Nettlefold to recover the possession of certain premises. It alleged
that at the county court the defendant in the present action appeared
for Nettlefold, and made statements regarding the conduct of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_762'>762</span>plaintiff in the present action, who was a debt collector and employed
by Fulcher as agent to recover possession of the premises.</p>

<p class='c007'>Statement of defence: That the words alleged to have been published
were a true and correct account and report of a certain trial in a
court of justice having jurisdiction in that behalf, and of certain words
spoken during the sitting of the court in the course of the trial, and
published for the public benefit, and without malice. Issue thereon.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial before Cockburn, C. J., at the Hilary Sittings, 1879, at
Westminster, it was proved that the defendant, who was a solicitor,
had sent the report set out in the claim of the trial of Nettlefold <em>v.</em>
Fulcher, before the Judge of the Marylebone county court, to the local
newspapers. Cockburn, C. J., left two questions to the jury: 1. Was
the report a fair one? 2. Was it sent honestly, or with a desire to
injure the plaintiff? The jury answered these questions: 1. That it
was in substance a fair report; 2. That it was sent with a certain
amount of malice; and found a verdict for the plaintiff with 40<em>s.</em>
damages. Cockburn, C. J., directed judgment to be entered for the
plaintiff for that amount.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant appealed on the ground that the judgment entered
upon the findings of the jury was wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Coleridge, C. J.</span><a id='r505'></a><a href='#f505' class='c015'><sup>[505]</sup></a> The question before us is whether, on the
findings of the jury, the entry of the judgment for the plaintiff is right.
I am of opinion that it was rightly entered for the plaintiff. The principle
which governs this case is plain. It is like that which governs
most other cases of privilege. In order, in cases of libel, to establish
that the communication is privileged, two elements must exist: not
only must the occasion create the privilege, but the occasion must be
made use of <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> and without malice; if either of these is absent,
the privilege does not attach; here the second element is absent, for
<i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fides</span></i> is wanting, and malice exists. There are certain cases in
which the privilege is absolute. Words spoken in the course of a legal
proceeding by a witness or by counsel, and words used in an affidavit
in the course of a legal proceeding, are absolutely privileged. It is
considered advantageous for the public interests that such persons
should not in any way be fettered in their statements. This is the
first time that a report of proceedings in a court of justice has been
sought to be brought within this same class of privilege. I am not
disposed to extend the bounds of privilege beyond the principles already
laid down, and I find no authority for its extension.</p>

  <h4 class='c013'>CLARK <em>v.</em> MOLYNEUX<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Court of Appeal, December 4, 1877.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 47 Law Journal Reports, Common Law, 230.</em><a id='r507'></a><a href='#f507' class='c015'><sup>[507]</sup></a></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The action was for slander and libel. The plaintiff, a clergyman of
the Church of England, had been formerly in the army, but left it in
the year 1863; and, after taking his degree at Cambridge, was ordained
by the Bishop of Exeter, and subsequently became curate at
Assington, to the Rev. H. L. Maud.</p>

<p class='c007'>In March, 1876, the defendant, the Rev. Canon Molyneux, the Rector
of Sudbury, which is in the neighborhood of Assington, when calling
on a Mr. G. Bevan, a banker, with whom he had been intimate for
twenty-four years, was informed by Mr. Bevan that the plaintiff was
going to preach one of a course of Lenten sermons at Newton Church,
in the neighborhood, and that he was sure that if Mr. Charles Smith,
the rector, knew what sort of a person the plaintiff was, he would
never permit him to preach in his church. Mr. Bevan then desired
the defendant, as an old friend of Mr. Smith’s, to let him know what
the plaintiff’s character was. In answer to the defendant’s inquiry as
to what was the nature of the charges against the plaintiff, Mr. Bevan
said that he had been obliged to leave the army through cheating with
cards, had lived an irregular life at Cambridge, had been guilty of
gross immorality when curate at Horringer, and had boasted of it.
The defendant, placing implicit reliance on Mr. Bevan, and thinking
that it was his duty to acquaint Mr. Charles Smith with the matter,
at once rode to his house, and, finding that he was ill in bed, communicated
his information to the Rev. H. Smith, his son, who was in
the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of the same month the defendant consulted the Rev. J. C.
Martyn, his rural dean, as to whether he should not speak to Mr.
Maud, the plaintiff’s rector. Mr. Martyn said he thought the defendant
ought to do so. As Mr. Maud was abroad, the defendant
spoke to his solicitor on the subject; and on Mr. Maud’s return he
received a letter from him, asking for information. The defendant
wrote an answer detailing the facts substantially as communicated to
him by Mr. Bevan; but some of the expressions in the letter were
stronger than those used by Mr. Bevan. “Profligate” was used instead
of “irregular,” and “expelled the army,” instead of “obliged to
leave the army.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant also consulted Mr. Green, his curate, who was announced
to preach one of the same course of sermons as the plaintiff.
Mr. Green had been with the plaintiff for twenty years, and was consulted
by him on every ecclesiastical matter that came before him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_764'>764</span>The communications made to Mr. Green, Mr. H. Smith and Mr.
Martyn were the slanders complained of, and the letter to Mr. Maud
was the libel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant relied solely on the privilege of the occasions and the
<i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fides</span></i> of his statements.</p>

<p class='c007'>The action was tried before Baron Huddleston and a special jury at
Bury St. Edmunds, at the Summer Assizes, 1876.</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned judge ruled that all the occasions were privileged, and
the case went to the jury on the question of express malice.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of his summing up the learned judge said: “Now in
law if a man says what is not true, or writes what is libellous, or says
what is slanderous of another, it is presumed that it is malicious. But
where the occasion is privileged, then you require something more, and
you require what the law calls express malice. I must tell you what
express malice means.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And again, at the close of the summing up:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“What you have to consider, then, is really and substantially this—assuming
that these occasions were privileged, do you think that
the defendant made those statements and wrote that letter <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>,
and in the honest belief that they were true—not merely that he believed
them himself, but honestly believed them, which means that he
had good grounds for believing them to be true. I do not mean to say
pig-headedly, pertinaciously and obstinately perhaps persuaded himself
of the matter for which he had no reasonable grounds, and of
which you twelve gentlemen would say they were perfectly unjustified.
If you think that under these circumstances Mr. Molyneux has taken
himself out of the privilege in consequence of the statements not being
made <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> and in the honest belief they were true, and that therefore
there is what in law is called malice in fact, which I have explained
to you, then your verdict will be for the plaintiff.”<a id='r508'></a><a href='#f508' class='c015'><sup>[508]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with £200 damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>These passages and the general tenor of the summing up, which was
to the same effect, constituted the misdirection complained of.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant moved for a new trial in the Queen’s Bench Division,
on the ground of misdirection, and that the verdict was against evidence;
but the court refused the rule. The defendant appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Brett, L. J.</span> I am of the same opinion; I think that there was,
what amounts in law to a misdirection; that the verdict was against
the evidence; and, further, that there was no evidence to go to the
jury.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the alleged misdirection, I do not think that we differ
from the Queen’s Bench Division in our view of the law, but I think
that, whatever the idea Baron Huddleston intended to convey to the
jury in his careful, elaborate, and, if I may say so, able summing up,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_765'>765</span>really was, it may have materially misled them, and if it may, that is
in law a misdirection.</p>

<p class='c007'>The summing up is founded on the assumption that the occasions of
the alleged slanders and libel were privileged, and that the defendant
was therefore excused in that which would otherwise have been actionable,
if he used the occasions fairly. Now it is right before criticising
the summing up of the learned judge to state, as clearly as one can,
what the law relating to excuse by reason of privilege in cases of libel
and slander really is. It is, I apprehend, this: When a defendant
claims that the occasion of a libel or slander is privileged, and when
it is held by the judge, whose duty it is to decide the matter, that the
occasion is privileged, the question arises,—under what conditions
can the defendant take advantage of the privilege? If the occasion is
privileged, it is so for some reason, and the defendant is entitled to the
protection of the privilege if he uses the occasion for that reason, but
not otherwise. If he uses the occasion for an indirect reason or motive,
he uses it, not for the reason which makes it privileged, but for
another. One, but by no means the only, indirect motive which can be
alleged, is the gratification of some anger or malice of his own. By
malice here I mean, not a pleading expression, but actual malice, or
what is termed malice in fact, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, a wrong feeling in the defendant’s
mind. If this malice be the indirect and wrong motive suggested in
a particular case, there are certain tests by which its existence may be
investigated. Two such tests are these: If a man is proved to have
stated what he knew to be false, no one inquires further, everybody
assumes thenceforth that he was malicious, that he did so wrong a
thing from some wrong motive. Again, if it be proved that out of
anger or from some other wrong motive the defendant has stated
something as a truth or as true, without knowing or inquiring whether
it was true or not, therefore reckless, by reason of his anger or other
motive, whether it is true or not, the jury may infer, and generally will
infer, that he used the occasion for the gratification of his anger or
malice, or other indirect motive, and not for the reason or motive
which occasions or justifies the privilege.</p>

<p class='c007'>These tests have been suggested before, and they were approved by
the whole Court of Common Pleas in a case tried before me at Leeds,
and I apprehend they are correct.</p>

<p class='c007'>That being so, I think that Baron Huddleston did not follow these
rules and tests, but others. Take his summing up as a whole, as I
think we ought, he left the case as if the burden of proving there was
no malice lay on the defendant, but if the occasion be privileged, the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">onus</span></i> of showing malice is at once thrown on the plaintiff. Further, in
order to guide the jury as to what malice was, he read the passage in
Bromage <em>v.</em> Prosser; what he read there is not a definition of malice
in fact, at all, but of that malice which is a technical term in certain
pleadings, where it simply means “wilfully.” It has been held, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_766'>766</span>in such pleadings the absence of the word maliciously is immaterial if
the word wilfully is present—because they are in such pleadings
synonymous terms. Then, I think the passage at the end of the summing
up is really a recapitulation of the sense of the whole summing
up, and might lead the jury to believe that, although they were of
opinion that the defendant did believe what he stated, he would not
be protected unless his belief was a reasonable one, as distinguished
from a pig-headed, obstinate, and insensible one. But the real question,
as I have stated, is, whether the defendant did, in fact, believe
his statement,<a id='r509'></a><a href='#f509' class='c015'><sup>[509]</sup></a> or whether being angry or moved by some other indirect
motive, did not know, and did not care, whether his statement
was true or false. Questions of pig-headedness and obstinacy may be
tests as to whether a man really did honestly believe or not, but Baron
Huddleston left them as if they were of the essence of the definition of
malice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The direction was therefore wrong if the occasions were privileged.
That they were I have a very strong opinion. The only occasion disputed
is that of the communication to Mr. Green the curate. I am
clearly of opinion that that was privileged. I think that where a
clergyman consults his curate as to his conduct in an ecclesiastical
matter, the occasion is a privileged one.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the other points, I think that at least the verdict was against
the evidence. But I think more, I think there was no evidence fit to
be submitted to a jury, and, therefore, if on a new trial the facts remain
the same, the judge’s duty will be to direct the jury that there is
no case. In this matter, therefore, there has been a miscarriage. But
I think that the case is not one in which to apply Order XL., rule 10,
and enter the verdict for the defendant, as it does not follow that on a
new trial further evidence may not be forthcoming.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>CARPENTER <em>v.</em> BAILEY<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New Hampshire, December, 1873.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 53 New Hampshire Reports, 590.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>This is an action on the case for a libel, by J. N. Carpenter against
J. H. Bailey, the writ bearing date September 21, 1869.<a id='r510'></a><a href='#f510' class='c015'><sup>[510]</sup></a> The declaration
alleges, that, on April 20, 1869, the plaintiff was a paymaster in
the navy, stationed as purchasing agent at Portsmouth; that, by the
rules of the navy department, he was entitled to remain on that station
three years; and that the defendant, contriving, &amp;c., published of him
the following libel: “To the Honorable the Senators and Members of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_767'>767</span>the House of Representatives in Congress from New Hampshire: The
undersigned, after much patience has been exhausted, beg to remonstrate
against the further continuance at this station of Paymaster
J. N. Carpenter as purchasing agent. In all our struggles, Paymaster
Carpenter has always voted against us, carrying the straight Democratic
ticket, throwing his patronage adversely to the friends of General
Grant, and always filling the requirements of a tool sent here by
ex-Secretary Welles to carry out the interests of Andrew Johnson.
May we hope for relief from such a burden? Let the rebel sympathizer
be exchanged for a man who will have office hours of a convenient
kind, and will be found there <em>at least once a day</em> to attend to
those having business there, and officers and citizens will alike be
grateful. Portsmouth, N. H., April 20, 1869. E. G. Peirce, Jr., Chas.
Robinson, Aaron Young, Daniel J. Vaughan, E. A. Stevens, W. H.
Hackett, John H. Bailey, Paine Durkee.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant pleaded in substance that he was informed and
believed that the plaintiff had done the things charged in the petition
and that he believed that “the public good, and the welfare of said
administration of General Grant, required that the said plaintiff
should be removed from said office at said station, and that a suitable
officer should be put there in his stead, and that the senators and
members of the House of Representatives in Congress from the State
of New Hampshire were the proper persons and officers to be petitioned
in order to procure the removal of the said plaintiff from said
office at said naval station, the defendant, in good faith, and without
malice or ill-will to the said plaintiff, but in order to procure the
removal of the plaintiff for the causes aforesaid from the said office,
signed said petition to said senators and representatives containing
said supposed libellous words in the plaintiff’s declaration mentioned,
as he lawfully might have done, for the cause aforesaid, and this he is
ready to verify.” Wherefore, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this plea the plaintiff demurred generally.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Sargent, C. J.</span> If the defendant cannot justify by showing the
truth of the matter charged, he may excuse the publication by showing
that it was made upon a lawful occasion, upon probable cause, and
from good motives.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is also said that matter in excuse in a prosecution for libel is
where the defendant, upon a lawful occasion, proceeded with good
motives upon probable grounds,—that is, upon reasons that were apparently
good, but upon a supposition which turns out to be unfounded.
This is a very different thing from showing the actual truth
of the allegations: where that is proved with a proper occasion, it is a
justification without regard to motives; but where the statements
made prove false, the defendant needs to show not only a proper occasion,
but a good motive also,—for, if the matter be untrue and the
motive bad, how could the end be justified or even excused? But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_768'>768</span>when the occasion is proper, one may be excused for stating what
proves to be untrue, if he had probable cause to believe it true, and
spoke it from good motives; see authorities, 9 N. H. 45.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, in Palmer <em>v.</em> Concord, 48 N. H. 217, it is said, by Smith, J., that
most of what are called “privileged communications” are conditionally,
not absolutely, privileged. The question is one of good faith, or
motive, and can be settled only by a jury. A court cannot rule that a
communication is privileged, without assuming the conditions on
which it is held to be privileged, namely, that it was made in good
faith, for a justifiable purpose, and with a belief, founded on reasonable
grounds, of its truth;—and see cases cited.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case before us, the occasion would be a lawful one, provided
the motive was good, and there was probable cause. And the question
is, whether the mere fact, that the defendant had been informed and
believed that a fact was so, is equivalent to having probable cause to
believe it to be so. And we think it could not be assumed that it was
so. A person might be informed of a fact by one in whom he might,
for some special reason, have confidence, but to whom no one else
would give the slightest credence; and a jury would readily find that
a belief in that case was founded upon information which would not
amount to probable cause for the belief of any man of ordinary capacity.
The question for the jury would be, not whether the defendant
believed it, but had he probable cause to believe it? There might be
belief without probable cause for it; and hence it would not be sufficient
to allege merely information and belief, because that might not,
in a given case, amount to probable cause. The fourth plea is substantially
correct in form, and goes as far as the rule thus laid down
will warrant; and we think this third plea is insufficient.</p>

  <h4 class='c013'>CAMPBELL <em>v.</em> SPOTTISWOODE<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Queen’s Bench, April 18, 1863.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 3 Best &amp; Smith, 769.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Cockburn, C. J.</span><a id='r512'></a><a href='#f512' class='c015'><sup>[512]</sup></a> I am of opinion that there ought to be no rule. The
article on which this action is brought is undoubtedly libellous. It imputes to
the plaintiff that, in putting forth to the public the sacred cause of the dissemination
of religious truth among the heathen, he was acting as an impostor,
and that his purpose was to put money into his own pocket by obtaining contributions
to his newspaper. The article also charges that, in furtherance of
that base and sordid purpose, he published in his newspaper the name of a
fictitious person as the authority for his statements, and still further that, with
a view to induce persons to contribute towards his professed cause, he published
a fictitious subscription list. These are serious imputations upon the
plaintiff’s moral as well as public character.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said, on behalf of the defendant, that, as the plaintiff addressed himself
to the public in a matter, not only of public, but of universal interest, his conduct
in that matter was open to public criticism, and I entirely concur in that
proposition. If the proposed scheme were defective, or utterly disproportionate
to the result aimed at, it might be assailed with hostile criticism. But then
a line must be drawn between criticism upon public conduct and the imputation
of motives by which that conduct may be supposed to be actuated; one
man has no right to impute to another, whose conduct may be fairly open to
ridicule or disapprobation, base, sordid, and wicked motives, unless there is so
much ground for the imputation that a jury shall find, not only that he had an
honest belief in the truth of his statements, but that his belief was not without
foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present case, the charges made against the plaintiff were unquestionably
without foundation. It may be that, in addition to the motive of religious
zeal, the plaintiff was not wholly insensible to the collateral object of
promoting the circulation of his newspaper, but there was no evidence that he
had resorted to false devices to induce persons to contribute to his scheme.
That being so, Mr. Bovill is obliged to say that, because the writer of this
article had a <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> belief that the statements he made were true, he was
privileged. I cannot assent to that doctrine. It was competent to the writer
to have attacked the plaintiff’s scheme; and perhaps he might have suggested,
that the effect of the subscriptions which the plaintiff was asking the public
to contribute would be only to put money into his pocket. But to say that he
was actuated only by the desire of putting money into his pocket, and that he
resorted to fraudulent expedients for that purpose, is charging him with dishonesty:
and that is going further than the law allows.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_770'>770</span>It is said that it is for the interests of society that the public conduct of
men should be criticised without any other limit than that the writer should
have an honest belief that what he writes is true. But it seems to me that the
public have an equal interest in the maintenance of the public character of
public men; and public affairs could not be conducted by men of honor with a
view to the welfare of the country, if we were to sanction attacks upon them,
destructive of their honor and character, and made without any foundation. I
think the fair position in which the law may be settled is this: that where the
public conduct of a public man is open to animadversion, and the writer who is
commenting upon it makes imputations on his motives which arise fairly and
legitimately out of his conduct so that a jury shall say that the criticism was
not only honest, but also well founded, an action is not maintainable.<a id='r513'></a><a href='#f513' class='c015'><sup>[513]</sup></a> But it
is not because a public writer fancies that the conduct of a public man is open
to the suspicion of dishonesty, he is therefore justified in assailing his character
as dishonest.<a id='r514'></a><a href='#f514' class='c015'><sup>[514]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The cases cited do not warrant us in going that length. In Paris <em>v.</em> Levy,
2 F. &amp; F. 71, there may have been an honest and well-founded belief that the
man who published the handbill which was commented upon could only have
had a bad motive in publishing it, and if the jury were of that opinion, the
writer who attacked him in the public press would be protected. We cannot
go farther than that.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Crompton, J.</span> I am of the same opinion.... The first question is,
whether the article on which this action is brought is a libel or no libel,—not
whether it is privileged or not. It is no libel, if it is within the range of fair
comment, that is, if a person might fairly and <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> write the article; otherwise
it is. It is said that there is a privilege, not to writers in newspapers only
but to the public in general, to comment on the public acts of public men, provided
the writer believes that what he writes is true; in other words, that this
belongs to the class of privileged communications, in which the malice of the
writer becomes a question for the jury; that is, where, from the particular circumstances
or position in which a person is placed, there is a legal or social
duty in the nature of a private or peculiar right, as opposed to the rights possessed
by the community at large, to assert what he believes. In these cases
of privilege there is an exemption from legal liability in the absence of malice;
and it is necessary to prove actual malice. But there is no such privilege here.
It is the right of all the Queen’s subjects to discuss public matters; but no person
can have a right on that ground to publish what is defamatory merely because
he believes it to be true. If this were so, a public man might have base
motives imputed to him without having an opportunity of righting himself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_771'>771</span>Therefore it is necessary to confine privilege, as the law has always confined it,
to cases of real necessity or duty, as that of a master giving a servant a character,
or of a person who had been robbed charging another with robbing him.
Though the word “privilege” is used loosely in some of the cases as applied
to the right which every person has to comment on public matters, I think that
in all the cases cited the real question was whether the alleged libel was a fair
comment such as every person might make upon a public matter, and if not,
there was no privilege.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Blackburn, J.</span> I also think that the law governing this case is so clearly
settled that we ought not to grant a rule. It is important to bear in mind that
the question is, not whether the publication is privileged, but whether it is a
libel. The word “privilege” is often used loosely, and in a popular sense,
when applied to matters which are not, properly speaking, privileged. But,
for the present purpose, the meaning of the word is that a person stands in
such a relation to the facts of the case that he is justified in saying or writing
what would be slanderous or libellous in any one else. For instance, a master
giving a character of a servant stands in a privileged relation; and the cases
of a memorial to the Lord Chancellor or the Home Secretary on the conduct
of a justice of the peace, Harrison <em>v.</em> Bush, and of a statement to a public functionary,
reflecting upon some public officer, Beatson <em>v.</em> Skene, 5 H. &amp; N. 538,
rank themselves under that class. In these cases no action lies unless there is
proof of express malice. If it could be shown that the editor or publisher of a
newspaper stands in a privileged position, it would be necessary to prove
actual malice. But no authority has been cited for that proposition;<a id='r515'></a><a href='#f515' class='c015'><sup>[515]</sup></a> and I
take it to be certain that he has only the general right which belongs to the
public to comment upon public matters, for example, the acts of a minister of
state; or, according to modern authorities somewhat extending the doctrine,
where a person has done or published anything which may fairly be said to invite
comment, as in the case of a handbill or advertisement; Paris <em>v.</em> Levy, 2
F. &amp; F. 71. In such cases every one has a right to make fair and proper comment;
and, so long as it is within that limit, it is no libel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question of libel or no libel, at least since Fox’s Act (32 G. 3, c. 60), is
for the jury; and in the present case, as the article published by the defendant
obviously imputed base and sordid motives to the plaintiff, that question depended
upon another,—whether the article exceeded the limits of a fair and
proper comment on the plaintiff’s prospectus; and this last question was
therefore rightly left to the jury. Then Mr. Bovill asked that a further question
should be left to them, viz., whether the writer of the article honestly believed
that it was true; and the jury have found that he did. We have to say
whether that prevents an action being maintained. I think not. <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">Bona fide</span></i>
belief in the truth of what is written is no defence to an action; it may mitigate
the amount, but it cannot disentitle the plaintiff to damages.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>The declaration stated, that the plaintiff, before the publishing of
any of the false, scandalous, malicious, and defamatory libels thereinafter
mentioned, was the author of, and had sold for divers large sums
of money, the respective copyrights of divers books of him the said Sir
John, to wit a certain book entitled “The Stranger in France,” a certain
other book, entitled “A Northern Summer,” a certain other book,
entitled “The Stranger in Ireland,” &amp;c. which said books had been
respectively published in 4to, yet that defendant intending to expose
him to, and to bring upon him great contempt, laughter, and ridicule,
falsely and maliciously published a certain false, scandalous, malicious,
and defamatory libel, in the form of a book, of and concerning the said
Sir John, and of and concerning the said books, of which the said Sir
John was the author as aforesaid, which same libel was entitled “My
Pocket Book, or Hints for a Ryghte Merrie and conceited Tour, in
quarto, to be called The Stranger in Ireland in 1805, (thereby alluding
to the said book of the said Sir John, thirdly above mentioned,)
by a knight errant (thereby alluding to the said Sir John),” and which
same libel contained therein a certain false, scandalous, malicious, and
defamatory print, of and concerning the said Sir John, and of and
concerning the said books of the said Sir John, 1st and 2dly above
mentioned, therein called, “Frontispiece,” and entitled “The Knight
(meaning the said Sir John) leaving Ireland with Regret,” and containing
and representing in the said print, a certain false, scandalous
and malicious, defamatory, and ridiculous representation of the said
Sir John, in the form of a man of ludicrous and ridiculous appearance,
holding a pocket-handkerchief to his face, and appearing to be
weeping, and also containing therein a certain false, malicious, and
ridiculous representation of a man of ludicrous and ridiculous appearance,
following the said representation of the said Sir John, and representing
a man loaded with, and bending under the weight of three
large books, one of them having the word “Baltic,” printed on the
back thereof, &amp;c., and a pocket-handkerchief appearing to be held in
one of the hands of the said representation of a man, and the corners
thereof appearing to be held or tied together, as if containing something
therein, with the printed word “wardrobe” depending therefrom,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_773'>773</span>(thereby falsely, scandalously, and maliciously, meaning and
intending to represent, for the purpose of rendering the said Sir John
ridiculous, and exposing him to laughter, ridicule, and contempt, that
one copy of the said 1st mentioned book of the said Sir John, and two
copies of the said book of the said Sir John 2dly above mentioned, were
so heavy as to cause a man to bend under the weight thereof, and that
his the said Sir John’s wardrobe was very small, and capable of being
contained in a pocket-handkerchief,) and which said libel also contained,
&amp;c. &amp;c. The declaration concluded by laying as special damage,
that the said Sir John had been prevented and hindered from
selling to Sir Richard Philips Knt. for a large sum of money to wit
£600, the copyright of a certain book or work of him the said Sir John,
of which the said Sir John was the author, containing an account of a
tour of him the said Sir John through part of Scotland, which but for
the publishing of the said false, scandalous, malicious, and defamatory
libels, he the said Sir John would, could, and might have sold to the
said Sir Richard Philips for the said last mentioned sum of money,
and the same remained wholly unsold and undisposed of, and was
greatly depreciated and lessened in value to the said Sir John.—Plea,
not guilty.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Ellenborough</span>, as the trial was proceeding, intimated an
opinion, that if the book published by the defendants only ridiculed
the plaintiff as an author, the action could not be maintained.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Garrow</em>, for the plaintiff, allowed, that when his client came forward
as an author, he subjected himself to the criticism of all who might be
disposed to discuss the merits of his works; but that criticism must be
fair and liberal; its object ought to be to enlighten the public, and to
guard them against the supposed bad tendency of a particular publication
presented to them, not to wound the feelings and to ruin the
prospects of an individual. If ridicule was employed, it should have
some bounds. While a liberty was granted of analyzing literary productions,
and pointing out their defects, still he must be considered as
a libeller, whose only object was to hold up an author to the laughter
and contempt of mankind. A man with a wen upon his neck perhaps
could not complain if a surgeon in a scientific work should minutely
describe it, and consider its nature and the means of dispersing it;
but surely he might support an action for damages against any one
who should publish a book to make him ridiculous on account of this
infirmity, with a caricature print as a frontispiece. The object of the
book published by the defendants clearly was, by means of immoderate
ridicule to prevent the sale of the plaintiff’s works, and entirely to
destroy him as an author. In the late case of Tipper <em>v.</em> Tabbart, 1
Camp. 350, his lordship had held that a publication by no means so
offensive or prejudicial to the object of it, was libellous and actionable.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Ellenborough.</span> In that case the defendant had falsely accused
the plaintiff of publishing what he had never published. Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_774'>774</span>the supposed libel has only attacked those works of which Sir John
Carr is the avowed author; and one writer in exposing the follies and
errors of another may make use of ridicule however poignant. Ridicule
is often the fittest weapon that can be employed for such a purpose.
If the reputation or pecuniary interests of the person ridiculed
suffer, it is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum absque injuria</span></i>. Where is the liberty of the press
if an action can be maintained on such principles? Perhaps the plaintiff’s
“Tour through Scotland” is now unsaleable; but is he to be
indemnified by receiving a compensation in damages from the person
who may have opened the eyes of the public to the bad taste and
inanity of his compositions? Who would have bought the works of
Sir Robert Filmer after he had been refuted by Mr. Locke? but shall
it be said that he might have sustained an action for defamation
against that great philosopher, who was laboring to enlighten and
ameliorate mankind? We really must not cramp observations upon
authors and their works. They should be liable to criticism, to
exposure, and even to ridicule, if their compositions be ridiculous;
otherwise the first who writes a book on any subject will maintain a
monopoly of sentiment and opinion respecting it. This would tend to
the perpetuity of error.—Reflection on personal character is another
thing. Show me an attack on the moral character of this plaintiff, or
any attack upon his character unconnected with his authorship, and
I shall be as ready as any judge who ever sat here to protect him; but
I cannot hear of malice on account of turning his works into ridicule.</p>

<p class='c007'>The counsel for the plaintiff still complaining of the unfairness of
this publication, and particularly of the print affixed to it, the trial
proceeded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Attorney-General</em> having addressed the jury on behalf of the
defendants—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Ellenborough</span> said, Every man who publishes a book commits
himself to the judgment of the public, and any one may comment
upon his performance. If the commentator does not step aside
from the work, or introduce fiction for the purpose of condemnation,
he exercises a fair and legitimate right. In the present case, had the
party writing the criticism followed the plaintiff into domestic life for
the purposes of slander, that would have been libellous; but no passage
of this sort has been produced, and even the caricature does not
affect the plaintiff, except as the author of the book which is ridiculed.
The works of this gentleman may be, for ought I know, very valuable;
but whatever their merits, others have a right to pass their judgment
upon them,—to censure them if they be censurable, and to turn them
into ridicule if they be ridiculous. The critic does a great service to the
public, who writes down any vapid or useless publication, such as
ought never to have appeared. He checks the dissemination of bad
taste, and prevents people from wasting both their time and money
upon trash.—I speak of fair and candid criticism; and this every one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_775'>775</span>has a right to publish, although the author may suffer a loss from it.
Such a loss the law does not consider as an injury; because it is a
loss which the party ought to sustain. It is in short the loss of fame
and profits to which he was never entitled. Nothing can be conceived
more threatening to the liberty of the press than the species of action
before the court. We ought to resist an attempt against free and
liberal criticism at the threshold.—The <span class='sc'>Chief Justice</span> concluded by
directing the jury, that if the writer of the publication complained of
had not travelled out of the work he criticised for the purpose of slander,
the action would not lie; but if they could discover in it anything
personally slanderous against the plaintiff, unconnected with the
works he had given to the public, in that case he had a good cause of
action, and they would award him damages accordingly.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>MERIVALE <em>v.</em> CARSON<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Court of Appeal, December 2, 1887.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 20 Queen’s Bench Division, 275.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Appeal by the defendant against the refusal of a divisional court
(Mathew and Grantham, JJ.) to allow a new trial of the action, or to
enter judgment for the defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The action was brought to recover damages in respect of an alleged
libel. At the trial before Field, J., it appeared that the plaintiff and
his wife were the joint authors of a play called “The Whip Hand.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_776'>776</span>The defendant was the editor of a theatrical newspaper called “The
Stage.” Early in May, 1886, the play was performed at a theatre in
Liverpool. On May 7 a criticism of the play was published in the defendant’s
newspaper. The part of the article charged in the statement
of claim as libellous was as follows: “‘The Whip Hand,’ the joint
production of Mr. and Mrs. Herman Merivale, gives us nothing but a
hash-up of ingredients which have been used <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad nauseam</span></i>, until one
rises in protestation against the loving, confiding, fatuous husband
with the naughty wife and her double existence, the good male genius,
the limp aristocrat, and the villainous foreigner. And why dramatic
authors will insist that in modern society comedies the villain must be
a foreigner, and the foreigner must be a villain, is only explicable on
the ground, we suppose, that there is more or less of romance about
such gentry. It is more in consonance with accepted notions that your
Continental croupier would make a much better fictitious prince, marquis,
or count than would, say, an English billiard-marker or stablelout.
And so the Marquis Colonna in ‘The Whip Hand’ is offered up
by the authors upon the altar of tradition and sacrificed in the usual
manner when he gets too troublesome to permit of the reconciliation of
husband and wife, and lover and maiden, and is proved, also much as
usual, to be nothing more than a kicked-out croupier.” The innuendo
suggested was that the article implied that the play was of an immoral
tendency.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was admitted that there was no adulterous wife in the play.</p>

<p class='c007'>Field, J., in the course of his summing-up to the jury, said: “The
question is, first, whether this criticism bears the meaning which the
plaintiffs put upon it. If it is a fair temperate criticism, and does not
bear that meaning, or is not fairly to be read as having that meaning,
then your verdict will be for the defendants.... It is not for a moment
suggested by any one that the defendant is animated by the
smallest possible malice towards the plaintiffs. There is no ground
for saying so, and no one has said so.... The malice which is necessary
in this action is one, which, if it existed at all, will be because the
defendant has exceeded his right of criticism upon the play. You
have the play before you, you must judge for yourselves. If it is no
more than fair, honest, independent, bold, even exaggerated, criticism,
then your verdict will be for the defendant. It is for the plaintiffs to
make out their case. They have to satisfy you that it is more than
that, otherwise they cannot complain. If you are satisfied upon the
evidence that it is more than that, then you will give your verdict for
the plaintiffs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs with one shilling damages,
and the judge entered judgment for the plaintiffs accordingly,
and declined to deprive them of costs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant appealed.<a id='r518'></a><a href='#f518' class='c015'><sup>[518]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_777'>777</span><span class='sc'>Lord Esher, M. R.</span> This action is brought in respect of an alleged
libel contained in a criticism by the defendant upon a play written by
the plaintiffs. The first thing to be considered is, what are the questions
which in such a case ought to be left to the jury? The first question
to be left to them is, what is the meaning of the alleged libel?
The jury must look at the criticism, and say what in their opinion any
reasonable man would understand by it. I am not prepared to say
that in coming to their conclusion they would not also have to look at
the work criticised. That, however, is not very material for us to consider
now. The proper question was put to the jury in the present
case. Two interpretations of the defendant’s article were placed
before them. One was that it meant that the play is founded upon
adultery, without containing any stigma on the fact that it is so
founded. The defendant’s article is alleged to be libellous in that it
attributed to the plaintiffs that they had written a play founded upon
adultery, without any objection to it on their part, in other words,
that they had written an immoral play. On behalf of the defendant
it was said that the article had no such meaning, that the expression
“naughty wife” does not mean “adulterous wife.” It would not
have that meaning in every case, but the question is whether, looking
at the context of the article, it has that meaning. If the court should
come to the conclusion that the expression could not by any reasonable
man be thought to have that meaning, they could overrule the verdict
of the jury; otherwise the question is for the jury.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is the next question to be put to the jury? Are they to be
told that the criticism of a play is a privileged occasion, within the
well-settled meaning of the word “privilege,” and that their verdict
must go for the defendant, unless the plaintiff can prove malice in fact,
that is, that the writer of the article was actuated by an indirect or
malicious motive? I think it is clear that that is not the law, and
that it was so decided in Campbell <em>v.</em> Spottiswoode, which has never
been overruled. All the judges, both before and ever since that case,
have acted upon the view there expressed, that a criticism upon a
written published work is not a privileged occasion. Blackburn, J.,
in his judgment, shows why it is not a privileged occasion. A privileged
occasion is one on which the privileged person is entitled to do
something which no one who is not within the privilege is entitled to
do on that occasion. A person in such a position may say or write
about another person things which no other person in the kingdom
can be allowed to say or write. But, in the case of a criticism upon a
published work, every person in the kingdom is entitled to do, and is
forbidden to do exactly the same things, and therefore the occasion is
not privileged. Therefore the second question to be put to the jury is,
whether the alleged libel is or is not a libel. The form in which that
question should be put is, I think, best expressed by Crompton, J., in
Campbell <em>v.</em> Spottiswoode. He says: “Nothing is more important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_778'>778</span>than that fair and full latitude of discussion should be allowed to
writers upon any public matter, whether it be the conduct of public
men, or the proceedings in courts of justice, or in Parliament, or the
publication of a scheme, or a literary work. But it is always to be left
to a jury to say whether the publication has gone beyond the limits of
a fair comment on the subject-matter discussed. A writer is not entitled
to overstep those limits, and impute base and sordid motives
which are not warranted by the facts, and I cannot for a moment
think, because he has a <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> belief that he is publishing what is
true, that is any answer to an action for libel.” He says that upon
the answer to the question there stated it depends whether the article
upon which the action is brought is or is not a libel. The question is
not whether the article is privileged, but whether it is a libel. What
is the meaning of a “fair comment”? I think the meaning is this:
is the article in the opinion of the jury beyond that which any fair
man, however prejudiced or however strong his opinion may be, would
say of the work in question? Every latitude must be given to opinion
and to prejudice, and then an ordinary set of men with ordinary judgment
must say whether any fair man would have made such a comment
on the work. It is very easy to say what would be clearly
beyond that limit; if, for instance, the writer attacked the private
character of the author. But it is much more difficult to say what is
within the limit. That must depend upon the circumstances of the
particular case. I think the right question was really left by Field, J.,
to the jury in the present case. No doubt you can find in the course
of his summing up some phrases which, if taken alone, may seem to
limit too much the question put to the jury. But, when you look at
the summing up as a whole, I think it comes in substance to the final
question which was put by the judge to the jury: “If it is no more
than fair, honest, independent, bold, even exaggerated, criticism,
then your verdict will be for the defendants.” He gives a very wide
limit, and, I think, rightly. Mere exaggeration, or even gross exaggeration,
would not make the comment unfair. However wrong the
opinion expressed may be in point of truth, or however prejudiced
the writer, it may still be within the prescribed limit. The question
which the jury must consider is this: Would any fair man, however
prejudiced he may be, however exaggerated or obstinate his view,
have said that which this criticism has said of the work which is criticised?
If it goes beyond that, then you must find for the plaintiff;
if you are not satisfied that it does, then it falls within the allowed
limit, and there is no libel at all. I cannot doubt that the jury were
justified in coming to the conclusion to which they did come, when
once they had made up their minds as to the meaning of the words
used in the article, viz. that the plaintiffs had written an obscene play;
and no fair man could have said that. There was therefore a complete
misdescription of the plaintiffs’ work, and the inevitable conclusion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_779'>779</span>was that an imputation was cast upon the characters of the authors.
Even if I had thought that the right direction had not been given to
the jury, I should have declined to grant a new trial, for the same verdict
must inevitably have been found if the jury had been rightly
directed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another point which has been discussed is this: It is said that if in
some other case the alleged libel would not be beyond the limits of fair
criticism, and it could be shown that the defendant was not really
criticising the work, but was writing with an indirect and dishonest
intention to injure the plaintiffs, still the motive would not make the
criticism a libel. I am inclined to think that it would, and for this
reason, that the comment would not then really be a criticism of the
work. The mind of the writer would not be that of a critic, but he
would be actuated by an intention to injure the author.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my opinion this appeal must be dismissed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bowen, L. J.</span> We must begin with asking ourselves, what is the
true meaning of the words used in the alleged libel? We have the
benefit of the machinery which the law gives—the verdict of a jury—for
ascertaining the meaning, and it must now be taken to have been
conclusively settled, that the writer of the criticism has imputed to
the plaintiffs that the story of their play turns in its main incident
upon an adulterous wife, and in such a way as not to lead any one
to suppose that the plaintiffs objected to the adultery, but, on the
contrary, that they had treated the adultery as a spicy incident in
the play, without expressing any opinion as to its morality. It has
been admitted by the defendant that the play does not in fact contain
any adulterous wife, that there is no incident of adultery in it,
and therefore it is not open to the suggestion that the plaintiffs have
treated adultery lightly in such a way as to tend to immorality. These
are the facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>What then is the law applicable to them? We must see, first, what
is the question which ought to have been left to the jury on this assumption
of the meaning of the article, and then whether it was in fact
left to them, and whether there was any miscarriage on their part. I
take precisely the same view as the Master of the Rolls with regard to
the way in which the word “privilege” ought to be used. The present
case is not, strictly speaking, one of “privileged occasion.” In a legal
sense that term is used with reference to a case in which one or more
members of the public are clothed with a greater immunity than the
rest. But in the present case we are dealing with a common right of
public criticism which every subject of the realm equally enjoys,—the
right of publishing a written criticism upon a literary work which
is offered to public criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that a different metaphysical exposition of this common
right is to be found in the judgment of Willes, J., in Henwood <em>v.</em> Harrison,
Law Rep. 7 C. P. 606. That learned judge and the majority of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_780'>780</span>the Court of Common Pleas seem to have treated this right as a
branch of the general law of privilege, and to have found a justification
for the use of the word “privilege” in the subject matter of the criticism,
although there is no limit of the number of the persons entitled
to make the criticism. With great respect to Willes, J., I agree with
the Master of the Rolls that this is not so good an exposition of the
right as that which is given by Blackburn, J., and Crompton, J., in
Campbell <em>v.</em> Spottiswoode. But the question is rather academical
than practical, for I do not think it would make any substantial difference
in the present case which view was the right one. But, among
other reasons, why I prefer the view of Blackburn, J., and Crompton,
J., is this, that it leaves undisturbed the mode of directing the jury in
cases of this class which has been ordinarily adopted, viz., to begin by
asking them whether they think the limits of fair criticism have been
passed. That implies that there is no libel if those limits are not
passed. It is only when the writer goes beyond the limits of fair criticism
that his criticism passes into the region of libel at all. This
leaves unsettled the inquiry, and perhaps it was intended in Campbell
<em>v.</em> Spottiswoode (a case which has never been questioned) to leave it
unsettled, what is the standard for the jury of “fair criticism”? The
criticism is to be “fair,” that is, the expression of it is to be fair. The
only limitation is upon the mode of expression. In this country a man
has a right to hold any opinion he pleases, and to express his opinion,
provided that he does not go beyond the limits which the law calls
“fair,” and, although we cannot find in any decided case an exact and
rigid definition of the word “fair,” this is because the judges have
always preferred to leave the question what is “fair” to the jury.
The nearest approach, I think, to an exact definition of the word
“fair” is contained in the judgment of Lord Tenterden, C. J., in
Macleod <em>v.</em> Wakley, 3 C. &amp; P., at p. 313, where he said, “Whatever is
fair, and can be reasonably said of the works of authors or of themselves,
as connected with their works, is not actionable, unless it appears
that, under the pretext of criticising the works, the defendant
takes an opportunity of attacking the character of the author: then
it will be a libel.” It must be assumed that a man is entitled to entertain
any opinion he pleases, however wrong, exaggerated, or violent it
may be, and it must be left to the jury to say whether the mode of
expression exceeds the reasonable limits of fair criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of literary criticism it is not easy to conceive what would
be outside that region, unless the writer went out of his way to make a
personal attack on the character of the author of the work which he
was criticising. In such a case the writer would be going beyond the
limits of criticism altogether, and therefore beyond the limits of fair
criticism. Campbell <em>v.</em> Spottiswoode was a case of that kind, and
there the jury were asked whether the criticism was fair, and they
were told that, if it attacked the private character of the author, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_781'>781</span>would be going beyond the limits of fair criticism. Still there is another
class of cases in which, as it seems to me, the writer would be
travelling out of the region of fair criticism,—I mean if he imputes to
the author that he has written something which in fact he has not
written. That would be a misdescription of the work. There is all the
difference in the world between saying that you disapprove of the
character of a work, and that you think it has an evil tendency, and
saying that a work treats adultery cavalierly, when in fact there is no
adultery at all in the story. A jury would have a right to consider the
latter beyond the limits of fair criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>Applying the law to the present case, we have to see whether the
learned judge misdirected the jury, having regard to their finding as to
the true construction of the article. Their construction of the words of
the article could not have been affected by what he said to them about
the meaning of “fair criticism.” The alleged libel stated that the
story of the plaintiffs’ play turned upon adultery. In a case of manifest
misdescription such as this the judge is not bound to go into all the
minutiæ as if the libel had been of a different character, and his summing-up
must be read with reference to this fact. I have read through
the summing-up of Field, J., and, though I do not think that his
language was altogether exact, yet what possible harm could it have
done having regard to the facts of the case? The jury had to deal
with a case of positive misdescription, a question not of opinion, but of
fact. Did not that fall clearly beyond the limits of fair criticism?
Could this court since the Judicature Act set aside the verdict of the
jury, merely because the language of the learned judge was not exactly
that which he would have used if he had written his summing-up?
Assuming the interpretation the jury put on the meaning of the words
to be correct, as we must assume, I entertain no doubt as to the correctness
of the remainder of the verdict. And, even if the view of the
law as to privilege which I do not adopt were the right view, I do not
think it would make any difference in the present case, because, the
misrepresentation being clear, the writer having not merely said that
the play had an evil tendency, but having imputed to the authors
that it was founded on adultery when there is no adultery at all in it,
the jury would have inferred, if the question had been left sufficiently
to them, that the writer was actuated by a malicious motive; that is
to say, by some motive other than that of a pure expression of a critic’s
real opinion.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Been reading ‘Fifty Years of Fleet Street’ just issued by Macmillan.
Purports to be the ‘Life and Recollections of Sir John Robinson,’
the man who made, and for a quarter of a century maintained
at high level, the <cite>Daily News</cite>. The story is written by Mr. F. M.
Thomas, who has added a new terror to death. There are biographies
of sorts ranging in value with the personality of the subject and the
skill of the compiler. The former occasionally suffers from the incapacity
of the latter. But at least his individuality is scrupulously observed.
Like Don José, what he has said he has said, his observations
and written memoranda not being mixed up with what his biographer
thinks he himself thought, uttered, and recorded. Mr. Thomas goes
about the biographer’s business in fresh fashion, complacently announced
by way of introduction to the volume. ‘I have not thought
it necessary or desirable,’ he writes, ‘to indicate in all cases what is his
(Sir John Robinson’s) and what is my own. If there is anything
amusing or entertaining in these pages, I am quite content that my
dear old chief should have the credit of it. The dulness I take upon
myself.’ Here be generosity! Here magnanimity! It is true that in
the performance of his task Mr. Thomas occasionally falls from this
high estate. More than once he airily alludes to ‘our diary’ and
‘our notes,’ as if he had prepared them in collaboration with his chief.
Possibly conscious for a moment of this indiscretion, and reverting to
more generous mood, he, approaching a particular narrative, introduces
it with the remark, ‘the incident may be given in the diarist’s
own words.’ The procedure is perhaps not unusual with earlier biographers.
With Mr. Thomas the relapse is rare. When he does let the
hapless subject speak for himself, he is relegated to small type. For
the rest, it is Mr. Thomas who <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">loquitur</span></i>, retelling poor Robinson’s cherished
stories as if they were his own, sometimes with heavy hand
brushing off the bloom. Even in these depressing circumstances
there is no mistaking Robinson’s sly humour, his gift of graphic
characterization. The worst of it is that, happening in the very same
page upon some banal remark, some pompous platitude, the alarmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_783'>783</span>reader, recognizing Mr. Thomas, hastily turns over half-a-dozen
pages, and possibly misses a handful of the genuine ore. These are
hard lines, unjust to Robinson, unfair to the public. It is plain to see,
from the few unmutilated extracts from Robinson’s manuscript which
illuminate the book, that the materials at hand for a delightful biography
were abundant. For nearly forty years the manager of the
<cite>Daily News</cite> lived in the very heart of things. He was behind most
scenes of public life, was more or less intimately acquainted with the
principal personages figuring in it. His sympathies were bountifully
wide, his observation alert, his sense of humour keen. He loved his
newspaper work with almost passionate affection. For him fifty years
of Fleet Street were worth a cycle of Cathay. That he habitually
made notes of what he saw and heard with the view to publication in
biographical form is undoubted. Mr. Thomas, impregnable in the
chain armour of complacency, positively admits it. ‘Robinson,’ he
says, ‘did leave some diaries—our diaries—more or less fragmentary,
and a number of thick, closely-written volumes of jottings in his
own handwriting, descriptive of events of which he had been an eyewitness
and people he had seen and known.’ Where is this treasure
trove? Presumably portions the biographer was good enough to regard
as worth adapting are filtered through the wordy pages of larger
type. Happily the material is so good, its original literary form so
excellent, that even this unparalleled atrocity cannot quite spoil the
book. We who knew Robinson on his throne in Bouverie Street and
at the well-known table in the dining-room of the Reform Club, rich
in recollections of William Black, Payn, and Sala; who watched him
enjoying himself like a boy at theatre first nights; who recognized his
rare capacity as a newspaper man; who knew the kind heart hidden
behind a studiously cultured severity of manner in business relations—we,
perhaps jealously, cherish his memory, and regret the surprising
chance that has made possible this slight upon it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The defence admitted that the defendant Lucy wrote, and that the
other defendants published, the words complained of, and pleaded that
the words were incapable of a defamatory meaning; and further, that
they were written for publication and were published as a criticism
and fair comment upon the plaintiff’s book without any malice towards
the plaintiff, and were a fair and <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> criticism and comment
upon the book which was a matter of public interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial the plaintiff’s case was, first, that the language of the
review itself was such as to furnish evidence that the writer was not
in truth criticising the book, but was maliciously attacking the author;
and, secondly, that there was evidence outside the review that the
defendant Lucy, in writing the criticism, was actuated by malice
towards the plaintiff. As extrinsic evidence of malice the plaintiff
relied upon the strained relations between Lucy and himself before the
criticism was published; on the fact that the criticism was published
<span class='pageno' id='Page_784'>784</span>as a separate article under the heading “Mangled Remains,” and was
not included in that part of the journal usually devoted to reviews of
books under the heading “Our Booking Office”; and on the answers
and demeanor of Lucy in the witness-box at the trial. At the close of
the plaintiff’s case counsel for the defendants submitted that there was
no case to go to the jury, upon the grounds that the article was incapable
of a defamatory meaning, and that there was no evidence that it
exceeded the limits of fair comment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned judge declined to withdraw the case from the jury, who
found a verdict for the plaintiff with 300<em>l.</em> damages.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>June 25. <span class='sc'>Collins, M. R.</span>, read the following judgment: This is
an appeal by the defendants from the verdict and judgment for the
plaintiff in an action of libel, tried before Darling, J., and a special
jury, based on a critique of a book written by the plaintiff. The
critique was written by the defendant Lucy, and appeared in <cite>Punch</cite>,
of which the first defendants are the publishers. The defence was
fair comment. The learned judge refused to withdraw the case from
the jury, who found for the plaintiff, with 300<em>l.</em> damages. The defendants
do not complain of misdirection other than that involved in holding
that there was any evidence fit for the consideration of a jury.
They ask for judgment on the ground that there was nothing in the
article which any reasonable jury could find to fall outside the limits
of fair comment, or in the alternative they ask for a new trial on the
ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants pressed us strongly with the case of McQuire <em>v.</em>
Western Morning News Co., [1903] 2 K. B. 100, a decision of this
court in an action for libel in respect of an article criticising adversely
a play of which the plaintiff was the author, where the court set aside
a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff on the ground that there was
no evidence on which a rational verdict for the plaintiff could be
founded. There were, however, two distinctions between that case
and the present. There was admittedly in that case no evidence of
actual malice unless it could be inferred from the terms of the article
itself, and there was some reason for supposing that the direction was
misleading. In the present case the plaintiff’s counsel strenuously contended
that there was extrinsic evidence of malice in the proved relations
of the parties before the action; the special manner in which the
particular article appeared in <cite>Punch</cite>; and in the expressions which fell
from the defendant Lucy, coupled with his demeanor in the witness-box,
and they relied also on the terms of an apology subsequently
printed as fortifying their contention. They urged besides that the
language of the article itself raised a question for the jury as to its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_785'>785</span>meaning, and that upon their view of its meaning would depend the
question whether it exceeded the bounds of fair comment or not. The
question, therefore, for our decision is whether there was any evidence
upon which a rational verdict for the plaintiff could be founded. If
so, the learned judge was bound to leave it to the jury. I have already
said that extrinsic evidence of malice, which I have attempted to summarize,
was allowed to go to the jury. The defendants contended that
this evidence amounted to nothing, and that no reasonable jury could
act upon it, but they also raised a contention which alone, as it seems to
me, gives any importance to this case. Their point was that if the
article itself, apart from the extrinsic evidence, did not raise a case for
the jury that the bounds of fair comment had been overstepped, proof
of actual malice on the part of the writer could not affect the question
or disturb his immunity. This is a formidable contention. It involves
the assertion that fair comment is absolute, not relative, and
must be measured by an abstract standard; that it is a thing quite
apart from the opinions and motives of its author and his personal
relations towards the writer of the thing criticised. It involves the
position also that an action based on a criticism is wholly outside the
ordinary law of libel, of which malice, express or implied, has always
been considered to be the gist.</p>

<p class='c007'>The basis of this contention, such as it is, appears to be a misconception
of the effect of the gloss, if I may so phrase it, first put upon
the law of libel in relation to fair comment in the dicta of Crompton,
J., and Blackburn, J., in Campbell <em>v.</em> Spottiswoode, decided in
1863, and subsequently approved in Merivale <em>v.</em> Carson, decided in
1887. I have already had occasion to examine the effect of these views
upon the law of libel in McQuire <em>v.</em> Western Morning News Co., [1903]
2 K. B. 100. In my opinion the substance of the matter remains unchanged
and malice remains exactly where it did. The dicta no doubt
assert the etymological inexactitude of the word “privilege” as connoting
a right common to the public at large, and the limits of the right
itself are pointed out which, whether it be called privilege or by any
other name, does not extend to cover misstatements of fact however
<i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>;<a id='r520'></a><a href='#f520' class='c015'><sup>[520]</sup></a> but they in no degree affect the standard by which the fairness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_786'>786</span>of the comment is to be judged or relieve the commentator from
liability, if the comment be malicious, if, indeed, it can then be described
as comment at all. The right, though shared by the public, is
the right of every individual who asserts it, and is, qua him, an individual
right whatever name it be called by, and comment by him which is
colored by malice cannot from his standpoint be deemed fair. He, and
he only, is the person in whose motives the plaintiff in the libel action
is concerned, and if he, the person sued, is proved to have allowed his
view to be distorted by malice, it is quite immaterial that somebody
else might without malice have written an equally damnatory criticism.
The defendant, and not that other person, is the party sued.
This seems to me quite clear in point of principle; but, as already
pointed out in McQuire <em>v.</em> Western Morning News Co., [1903] 2 K. B.
100, the law continued to be administered after Campbell <em>v.</em> Spottiswoode,
just as it always had been before, down to and since Merivale
<em>v.</em> Carson. That case decided nothing inconsistent with the law of
libel as thus administered, though each of the learned judges expressed
an opinion in favor of the view taken in the dicta I have referred to of
Crompton, J., and Blackburn, J., in preference to that of Willes, J., in
Henwood <em>v.</em> Harrison, L. R. 7 C. P. 600. But, as already pointed out
in McQuire <em>v.</em> Western Morning News Co., [1903] 2 K. B. 100, the
difference between the two views is, in the language of Bowen, L. J.,
in Merivale <em>v.</em> Carson, a difference in the “metaphysical exposition”
of the right and “is rather academical than practical.” I think the
head-note in the last-mentioned case is to some extent the cause of
what seems to me an erroneous impression as to the effect of the
decision. The words of that note seem to suggest a difference of right,
under the general law of libel, in respect of communications made on
a privileged occasion and communications made in the shape of criticism
on a matter of public interest. In cases of privilege, properly
so called, nothing that falls outside the privilege is protected by it,
and if defamatory it must be otherwise justified. The occasion being
privileged, the extent of the privilege may vary according to the nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_787'>787</span>of the case and the limits of the right or duty which is the basis of
the privilege. But this is precisely the position in the case where the
right exercised is one shared by the rest of the public, and not one
limited to an individual or a class. The extent of the right has to be
ascertained, and in respect of any communication which falls within it
the immunity, if it be not absolute, can be displaced only by proof of
malice. In the case of comment on literary works the occasion is
created by the publication, and a right then arises to criticise honestly,
however adversely. No such occasion would arise in respect of a
private unpublished letter. If a writer were to get hold of a private
letter of a well-known author and publish a damnatory article on the
author’s literary style and taste, as evidenced by the letter, it seems to
me that he would have no immunity from the ordinary law in respect
of defamatory writings. The only difference, then, in the legal incidents
of ordinary privilege, limited to individuals on the one hand and
the right in the public to criticise on the other, would seem to be that
the one might, with somewhat less latitude than the other, though not,
perhaps, with perfect accuracy, be described as “privilege.” Now,
the head-note might possibly suggest, at first sight at all events,
particularly when it adds “Henwood <em>v.</em> Harrison, L. R. 7 C. P. 606,
dissented from,” that not merely an academical difference in the
analysis of rights had been expressed, but that there was a difference
of substance in the bearing of malice in the two cases in respect of communications
or criticisms falling <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> within the right or privilege.
The limits of the right, as I have already pointed out, may be,
and are, different, but the law with respect to communications that
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> fall within them is the same. Proof of malice may take a
criticism <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> fair outside the right of fair comment, just as it
takes a communication <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> privileged outside the privilege.
The particular allegation which was unprotected in Merivale <em>v.</em> Carson
was never within the “right” when the facts were ascertained by the
jury in interpreting the passage impugned. Proof of <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> belief
was therefore irrelevant; nothing but proof of the truth could justify
the allegation. If the analysis be strictly carried out it will be found
that the two rights, whatever name they are called by, are governed by
precisely the same rules. The only practical difference is that in an
action based on a criticism of a published work the transaction begins
by the admission, on the part of the plaintiff, implied from the averment
by him of publication of the work criticised, that the comment
came into existence on a protected occasion. He is placed, therefore,
in precisely the same position as he would have been in had he sued in
respect of a defamatory writing <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> unprotected and therefore
actionable, but had gone on to aver facts which created a privilege
strictly so called. Beginning thus at this stage in the transaction, he
would have accepted the onus of proving malice in fact. If he had
veiled the fact that the writing criticised had become matter of public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_788'>788</span>interest by publication it would have been <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> libellous, and
the defendant would have had to plead such a publication as would let
in the right to comment on a matter of public interest in order to bring
himself within the protection. This shows that acceptance of the
dicta under discussion does not in the slightest degree affect the place
of malice in the law of libel, and that it is only by leaving out one step
in the analysis that the public right, as distinguished from the privilege,
may appear to carry with it different incidents. There is not even
any decision that the word privilege, as used in Henwood <em>v.</em> Harrison,
to which Lord Esher was himself a party, is not as good a word as any
substitute that can be suggested to express the right by which, in certain
circumstances, writing defamatory of another person may be
published with impunity, because the presumption of malice is negatived.
For the reasons I have given the difference is one of words
only, and could not be a matter of legal decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have thought it worth while to sift this contention somewhat elaborately,
as it is apparently based upon a misconception which seems
to have a tendency to repeat itself as to the effect of Merivale <em>v.</em> Carson,
on the law of libel. But the contention of the defendants can be
met, not by reference to principle only, but also by direct authority.
To go back to the source itself of the supposed new departure, Campbell
<em>v.</em> Spottiswoode, Blackburn, J., says: “Honest belief may be an
ingredient to be taken into consideration by the jury in determining
whether the publication is a libel, that is, whether it exceeds the limits
of a fair and proper comment.” In Merivale <em>v.</em> Carson itself Lord
Esher, M. R., deals with the question. He says: “It is said that if
in some other case the alleged libel would not be beyond the limits
of fair criticism, and it could be shown that the defendant was not
really criticising the work, but was writing with an indirect and dishonest
intention to injure the plaintiffs still the motive would not
make the criticism a libel. I am inclined to think that it would, and
for this reason, that the comment would not then really be a criticism
of the work. The mind of the writer would not be that of a
critic, but he would be actuated by an intention to injure the author.”
Though the learned judge in this passage expresses only an inclination
of opinion, the reason given seems to me to be conclusive. But in a
very recent case in this court, the point is actually decided: Plymouth
Mutual Coöperative and Industrial Society <em>v.</em> Traders’ Publishing
Association, [1906] 1 K. B. 403. The question there was whether an
interrogatory addressed to the state of mind of the defendant, who had
pleaded fair comment in an action of libel, was admissible. The court
decided that it was, following a previous decision of this court in a
case of privilege strictly so called. Vaughan Williams, L. J., referring
to White &amp; Co. <em>v.</em> Credit Reform Association and Credit Index, [1905]
1 K. B. 653, says at page 413 of the report: “It seems to me that that
case shows that an interrogatory of this kind is just as relevant and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_789'>789</span>admissible in a case where the defence is fair comment as in one where
it is privilege. In either case the question raised is really as to the
state of mind of the defendant when he published the alleged libel, the
question being in the one case whether he published it in the spirit of
malice, in the other whether he published it in the spirit of unfairness.
In either case, I think such an interrogatory as the one now in question
is admissible.” Fletcher Moulton, L. J., says at page 418 of the
report: “I am clear that, both in cases in which the defence of privilege
and in those in which the defence of fair comment is set up, the
state of mind of the defendant when he published the alleged libel is a
matter directly in issue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, of course, possible for a person to have a spite against another
and yet to bring a perfectly dispassionate judgment to bear upon his
literary merits; but, given the existence of malice, it must be for the
jury to say whether it has warped his judgment. Comment distorted
by malice cannot in my opinion be fair on the part of the person who
makes it. I am of opinion, therefore, that evidence of malice actuating
the defendant was admissible, and that the learned judge was
right in letting the evidence in this case go to the jury. But I am also
of opinion on a close examination of the alleged libel that, apart from
the extrinsic evidence of malice, the learned judge could not have
withdrawn the case from the jury. One point made by the plaintiff
would, I think, of itself suffice to establish this position. The defendant
Lucy says in the alleged libel “it is plain to see from the few unmutilated
extracts&#160;... that the materials at hand for a delightful
biography were abundant.” This statement was described by the
plaintiff in a letter to the editor of <cite>Punch</cite> as “simply untrue.” A
short statement was thereupon published in the issue of December 7,
in which the defendant, while accepting the plaintiff’s statement as
to the paucity of materials, quotes a passage from the preface to the
book dealing with the existence of materials, and concludes thus:
“Toby, M. P., had at the time of writing no knowledge of the subject
beyond the definite statements quoted in the biographer’s own words.
He regrets that, accepting them in their ordinary sense, he received
and conveyed an impression of Mr. Thomas’s literary methods which
turns out to have been erroneous.” He is thus in the difficulty of having
to admit a misstatement of fact in respect of which, to put it at
the lowest, a question must arise for the jury whether the passage he
relied upon justifies the statement. I think also that the learned
judge could not have properly held that there was no evidence fit for
the consideration of the jury as to some of the innuendoes averring imputations
of discreditable motives. I am of opinion, therefore, that
we could not direct judgment for the defendants without usurping the
functions of the jury. Neither can we say that the evidence is so
slight as to justify us in ordering a new trial on the ground that the
verdict is against the weight of the evidence.</p>

<p class='c022'>This case was tried before Williams, J., at Guildhall, in the sittings after
last Easter Term.</p>

<p class='c019'>The declaration stated that, “before the speaking, &amp;c., the defendant had
been a man-milliner, and the plaintiff had been in his service and employ as a
saleswoman and assistant, and the defendant falsely, &amp;c., spoke, &amp;c., of the
plaintiff the words ‘Miss Jackson’ (thereby meaning the plaintiff) ‘is dishonest,’
thereby meaning that the plaintiff was a thief and a dishonest servant,
and had been guilty of fraudulent conduct in her capacity as such saleswoman,
&amp;c., whereby, &amp;c., the plaintiff was injured in credit and reputation, and certain
persons trading under the name and style of ‘Capper, Son, &amp; Co.’ refused
to employ the plaintiff as saleswoman and servant in their employ, as they
otherwise would have done, and the plaintiff lost and was deprived of her said
situation in the employ of the said ‘Capper, Son, &amp; Co.,’ and has been for a
long space of time unable to obtain employment, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_791'>791</span>Plea—Not guilty.</p>

<p class='c019'>The plaintiff entered the defendant’s service on December 1st, 1862, and remained
in his employ till October, 1863, when she left, he having accused her
of taking some money, and a few other things. Shortly after she left, she
returned for her boxes, and asked him for her wages, and he then accused her
of taking £3 10<em>s.</em>, but said, “if you had come back, I should have said nothing
about it.” A few days after he paid her her wages. Two or three days after
this, she applied to the Messrs. Capper, Son &amp; Co., for a situation; and she informed
the defendant that a young lady was coming to him for a reference, and
he then said, “I will give you no reference, but if you own that you took the
money I will give you a reference.” The lady from Messrs. Capper, Son, &amp;
Co. called at the defendant’s and asked him for the plaintiff’s character, when
he spoke the words in the declaration, and said he would not give her a character,
she was dishonest, and that he had money and goods which he could
prove she had taken. The plaintiff did not get the situation, the wages for
which were £50 a year and board. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff
for £60.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>Mr. Chambers</em>, Q. C. (<em>Hance</em> with him), now moved for a rule calling on the
plaintiff to show cause why this verdict should not be set aside, and instead
thereof a nonsuit entered, on the ground that there was no evidence of express
malice; or for a new trial, on the grounds that the verdict was against the evidence,
and that the damages were excessive.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Erle, C. J.</span> I am of opinion that there should be no rule in this case. This
was an action for defamation of character, and evidence was adduced on the
part of the defendant to show that the defamatory words were uttered on an
occasion which justified the use of them. The question left to the jury was,
whether the defendant believed the imputation of dishonesty, which he made
against the plaintiff, was true or not, and they found he did not believe it to
be so, and the judge is satisfied with their answer. I think this was a necessary
question to be left to them. Then, as to the damages being excessive, the
plaintiff lost a situation for which she would have received £50 a year, and it
cannot be said that £60 is too large a sum as compensation for that loss. Mr.
Chambers also moved on the ground that it was the judge’s duty to nonsuit
the plaintiff at the close of the plaintiff’s case; but she tried to get another
situation, and a lady called on the defendant for her character, and he then
spoke to the lady the words complained of; where words are spoken on such an
occasion as that, if the person uttering them believe them to be true, and there
be no further evidence to show a probability that they were spoken maliciously,
it is the duty of the judge to nonsuit the plaintiff. The cases of Taylor
<em>v.</em> Hawkins, 16 Q. B. 308, and Somerville <em>v.</em> Hawkins, 10 C. B. 583, show what
is the law under such circumstances, and lay down that, if the plaintiff give
evidence from which the jury might infer malice, such as, that the defendant
made the imputations not believing them to be true, or that at the time when
he spoke the words he did not believe he was in the discharge of a duty, the
question of malice ought to be left to the jury; and it appears from the old
cases, and also the two cases above cited, that defamation carries with it a presumption
of malice, and that it is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> evidence of malice, but the occasion
on which the defamatory words are spoken may rebut the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> inference
of malice, and then additional evidence may be given to show that
there was malice, and the jury are to find on that evidence and on the libel
itself whether there be malice. In the case of Wright <em>v.</em> Woodgate, 2 C. M. &amp;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_792'>792</span>R. 573, it is thus laid down by Parke, B., at p. 577: “The proper meaning of a
privileged communication is only this, that the occasion on which the communication
was made rebuts the inference <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> arising from a statement
prejudicial to the character of the plaintiff, and puts it upon him to prove
that there was malice; in fact, that the defendant was actuated by motives of
personal spite or ill-will, independent of the occasion on which the communication
was made. In the present case, it became, in my opinion, incumbent
upon the plaintiff to show malice in fact. This he might have made out, either
from the language of the letter itself, or by extrinsic evidence, as by proof of
the conduct or expressions of the defendant, showing that he was actuated by
a motive of personal ill-will.” And in Taylor <em>v.</em> Hawkins, Lord Campbell lays
it down at p. 321 thus: “The rule is, that, if the occasion be such as repels the
presumption of malice, the communication is privileged, and the plaintiff
must then, if he can, give evidence of malice.” I think that the fact of his
charging her with stealing the £3 10<em>s.</em>, and, not making that charge till after
she had threatened to leave, and then the fact of his telling her that if she had
come back he should have said nothing about it, and that if she owned she
took it he would give her a reference, were sufficient facts to justify the jury
in inferring that he was not performing the important duty between man and
man, of stating what he believed to be the plaintiff’s true character, when he
spoke the words which are the subject of this action.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>DAVIS <em>v.</em> SHEPSTONE<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Privy Council, March 5, 1886.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 11 Appeal Cases, 187.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>The judgment of their lordships was delivered by</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Herschell, L. C.</span><a id='r524'></a><a href='#f524' class='c015'><sup>[524]</sup></a> This is an appeal from a judgment of the
Supreme Court of the Colony of Natal refusing a new trial in an action
brought against the appellants in which the respondent obtained a
verdict for £500 damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The action was brought to recover damages for alleged libels published
by the appellants in the “Natal Witness” newspaper in the
months of March and May, 1883.</p>

<p class='c007'>The respondent was, in December, 1882, appointed Resident Commissioner
in Zululand, and proceeded in the discharge of his duties to
the Zulu reserve territory. In the month of March, 1883, the appellants
published in an issue of their newspaper serious allegations with
reference to the conduct of the respondent whilst in the execution of
his office in the reserve territory. They stated that he had not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_793'>793</span>himself violently assaulted a Zulu chief, but had set on his native
policemen to assault others. Upon the assumption that these statements
were true, they commented upon his conduct in terms of great
severity, observing, “We have always regarded Mr. Shepstone as a
most unfit man to send to Zululand, if for no other reason than this,
that the Zulus entertain towards him neither respect nor confidence.
To these disqualifications he has now, if our information is correct,
added another which is far more damnatory. Such an act as he has
now been guilty of cannot be passed over, if any kind of friendly relations
are to be maintained between the colony and Zululand. There
are difficulties enough in that direction without need for them to be
increased by the headstrong and almost insane imprudence and want
of self-respect of the official who unworthily represents the government
of the Queen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the same issue, under the heading “Zululand,” there appeared a
statement that four messengers had come from Natal to Zululand,
from whom details had been obtained of the respondent’s treatment of
certain chiefs of the reserved territory who had visited Cetewayo, and,
what purported to be the account derived from these messengers of the
assault and abusive language of which the respondent had been guilty,
was given in detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 16th of May, 1883, the appellants published a further article,
relating to the respondent, which commenced as follows:—“Some
time ago we stated in these columns that Mr. John Shepstone,
whilst in Zululand, had committed a most unprovoked and altogether
incomprehensible assault upon certain Zulu chiefs. At the time the
statement was made, a good deal of doubt was thrown upon the truth
of the story. We are now in a position to make public full details
of the affair, which the closest investigation will prove to be correct.
A representative of this journal, learning that a deputation had come
to Natal to complain of the attack, met five of the number, and in the
presence of the competent interpreters took down the stories of each
man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The article then gave at length the statements so taken down, which
disclosed, if true, the grossest misconduct on the part of the respondent.
It was in respect of these publications of the appellants that the
action was brought by the respondent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appellants by their defence averred that the conduct of the
plaintiff as British Resident Commissioner was a matter of general
public interest affecting the territory of Natal, and that the alleged
libels constituted a fair and accurate report of the information brought
to the Governor of Natal, and published in the colony by messengers
from Zululand and its king as to the conduct of the plaintiff in the discharge
of the duties of his office, and a fair and impartial comment
upon the conduct of the plaintiff in his public capacity published <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona
fide</span></i> and without malice.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_794'>794</span>The case came on for trial before Mr. Justice Wragg and a jury on
the 4th of September, 1883, when it was proved that the allegations of
misconduct made against Mr. Shepstone were absolutely without
foundation, and no attempt was made to support them by evidence.
It appeared that the messengers from whom the statements contained
in the issue in March were derived had come from Zululand to see the
Bishop of Natal, and that their statements had been conveyed to the
editor of a newspaper by a letter from the bishop. The statements
contained in the issue of May were communicated by a Mr. Watson,
who was connected with the staff of the newspaper, and who had
sought and obtained an interview with certain Zulus when on their
way to convey a message from the king to the Governor of Natal.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the close of the evidence the learned judge summed up the case to
the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff, the present respondent,
for £500.</p>

<p class='c007'>Application was afterwards made to the Supreme Court to grant a
new trial, but this application was refused, and the present appeal was
then brought. The appellants rested their appeal upon two grounds,
first, that the learned judge misdirected the jury in leaving to them
the question of privilege and in not telling them that the occasion was
a privileged one. The second ground insisted upon was that the damages
were excessive. Their Lordships are of opinion that the contention
that the learned judge ought to have told the jury that the
occasion was a privileged one, and that the plaintiff could only succeed
on proof of express malice, is not well founded.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no doubt that the public acts of a public man may lawfully
be made the subject of fair comment or criticism, not only by the press,
but by all members of the public. But the distinction cannot be too
clearly borne in mind between comment or criticism and allegations of
fact, such as that disgraceful acts have been committed, or discreditable
language used. It is one thing to comment upon or criticise, even
with severity, the acknowledged or proved acts of a public man, and
quite another to assert that he has been guilty of particular acts of
misconduct.<a id='r525'></a><a href='#f525' class='c015'><sup>[525]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_795'>795</span>In the present case the appellants, in the passages which were complained
of as libellous, charged the respondent, as now appears without
foundation, with having been guilty of specific acts of misconduct,
and then proceeded, on the assumption that the charges were true, to
comment upon his proceedings in language in the highest degree offensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_796'>796</span>and injurious; not only so, but they themselves vouched for the
statements by asserting that though some doubt had been thrown
upon the truth of the story, the closest investigation would prove it to
be correct. In their Lordships’ opinion there is no warrant for the doctrine
that defamatory matter thus published is regarded by the law as
the subject of any privilege.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was insisted by the counsel for the appellants that the publications
were privileged, as being a fair and accurate report of the
statements made by certain messengers from King Cetewayo upon a
subject of public importance. It has, indeed, been held that fair and
accurate reports of proceedings in parliament and in courts of justice
are privileged, even though they contain defamatory matter affecting
the character of individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in the case of Purcell <em>v.</em> Sowler the Court of Appeal expressly
refused to extend the privilege even to the report of a meeting of poor
law guardians, at which accusations of misconduct were made against
their medical officer. And in their Lordships’ opinion it is clear that
it cannot be extended to a report of statements made to the Bishop of
Natal, and by him transmitted to the appellants, or to statements
made to a reporter in the employ of the appellants, who for the purposes
of the newspaper, sought an interview with messengers on their
way to lay a complaint before the governor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The language used by the learned judge in summing up the present
case to the jury is open to some criticism, and does not contain so
clear and complete an exposition of the law as might be desired. But
in their Lordships’ opinion, so far as it erred, it erred in being too
favorable to the appellants, and it is not open to any complaint on
their part.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only question that remains is as to the amount of damages. The
assessment of these is peculiarly the province of the jury in an action
of libel. The damages in such an action are not limited to the amount
of pecuniary loss which the plaintiff is able to prove. And their Lordships
see no reason for saying that the damages awarded were excessive
or for interfering with the finding of the jury in this respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>They will, therefore, humbly advise Her Majesty that the judgment
appealed against should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with
costs.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII<br /> INTERFERENCE WITH PRIVACY</h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c013'>ROBERSON <em>v.</em> ROCHESTER FOLDING BOX COMPANY<br /> <span class='sc'>Court of Appeals, New York, June 27, 1902.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 171 New York Reports, 538.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Parker, C. J.</span><a id='r526'></a><a href='#f526' class='c015'><sup>[526]</sup></a> The Appellate Division<a id='r527'></a><a href='#f527' class='c015'><sup>[527]</sup></a> has certified that the following
questions of law have arisen in this case, and ought to be reviewed
by this court: 1. Does the complaint herein state a cause of
action at law against the defendants or either of them? 2. Does the
complaint herein state a cause of action in equity against the defendants
or either of them? These questions are presented by a demurrer
to the complaint, which is put upon the ground that the complaint
does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a demurrer admits not only those facts which are expressly alleged
in the complaint, but everything which can be implied by fair
and reasonable intendment from its allegations (Marie <em>v.</em> Garrison, 83
N.Y. 14, 23), we are to inquire whether the complaint, regarded from
the standpoint of this rule, can be said to show any right to relief
either in law or in equity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The complaint alleges that the Franklin Mills Co., one of the defendants,
was engaged in a general milling business and in the manufacture
and sale of flour; that before the commencement of the
action, without the knowledge or consent of plaintiff, defendants,
knowing that they had no right or authority so to do, had obtained
made, printed, sold, and circulated about 25,000 lithographic prints,
photographs and likenesses of plaintiff, made in a manner particularly
set up in the complaint; that upon the paper upon which the likenesses
were printed and above the portrait there were printed, in large, plain
letters, the words, “Flour of the Family,” and below the portrait in
large capital letters, “Franklin Mills Flour,” and in the lower right-hand
corner in smaller capital letters, “Rochester Folding Box Co.,
Rochester, N.Y.”; that upon the same sheet were other advertisements
of the flour of the Franklin Mills Co.; that those 25,000 likenesses
of the plaintiff thus ornamented have been conspicuously posted
and displayed in stores, warehouses, saloons, and other public places;
that they have been recognized by friends of the plaintiff and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_798'>798</span>people, with the result that plaintiff has been greatly humiliated by
the scoffs and jeers of persons who have recognized her face and picture
on this advertisement and her good name has been attacked, causing
her great distress and suffering both in body and mind; that she
was made sick and suffered a severe nervous shock, was confined to her
bed and compelled to employ a physician, because of these facts; that
defendants had continued to print, make, use, sell, and circulate the
said lithographs, and that by reason of the foregoing facts plaintiff
had suffered damages in the sum of $15,000. The complaint prays
that defendants be enjoined from making, printing, publishing, circulating,
or using in any manner any likenesses of plaintiff in any form
whatever, for further relief (which it is not necessary to consider here)
and for damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be observed that there is no complaint made that plaintiff
was libelled by this publication of her portrait. The likeness is said
to be a very good one, and one that her friends and acquaintances
were able to recognize: indeed, her grievance is that a good portrait
of her, and, therefore, one easily recognized, has been used to attract
attention toward the paper upon which defendant mill company’s advertisements
appear. Such publicity, which some find agreeable, is to
plaintiff very distasteful, and thus, because of defendants’ impertinence
in using her picture without her consent for their own business
purposes, she has been caused to suffer mental distress where others
would have appreciated the compliment to their beauty implied in the
selection of the picture for such purposes; but as it is distasteful to
her, she seeks the aid of the courts to enjoin a further circulation of
the lithographic prints containing her portrait made as alleged in the
complaint, and as an incident thereto, to reimburse her for the damages
to her feelings, which the complaint fixes at the sum of $15,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no precedent for such an action to be found in the decisions
of this court; indeed, the learned judge who wrote the very able and
interesting opinion in the Appellate Division said, while upon the
threshold of the discussion of the question: “It may be said in the
first place that the theory upon which this action is predicated is new,
at least in instance if not in principle, and that few precedents can be
found to sustain the claim made by the plaintiff, if indeed it can be
said that there are any authoritative cases establishing her right to
recover in this action.” Nevertheless, that court reached the conclusion
that plaintiff had a good cause of action against defendants, in
that defendants had invaded what is called a “right of privacy”—in
other words, the right to be let alone. Mention of such a right is not
to be found in Blackstone, Kent, or any other of the great commentators
upon the law, nor so far as the learning of counsel or the courts
in this case have been able to discover, does its existence seem to have
been asserted prior to about the year 1890, when it was presented with
attractiveness and no inconsiderable ability in the Harvard Law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_799'>799</span>Review (Vol. IV, page 193) in an article entitled “The Right of
Privacy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The so-called right of privacy is, as the phrase suggests, founded
upon the claim that a man has the right to pass through this world,
if he wills, without having his picture published, his business enterprises
discussed, his successful experiments written up for the benefit
of others, or his eccentricities commented upon either in handbills,
circulars, catalogues, periodicals, or newspapers, and, necessarily, that
the things which may not be written and published of him must not be
spoken of him by his neighbors, whether the comment be favorable or
otherwise. While most persons would much prefer to have a good
likeness of themselves appear in a responsible periodical or leading
newspaper rather than upon an advertising card or sheet, the doctrine
which the courts are asked to create for this case would apply as well
to the one publication as to the other, for the principle which a court
of equity is asked to assert in support of a recovery in this action is
that the right of privacy exists and is enforceable in equity, and that
the publication of that which purports to be a portrait of another person,
even if obtained upon the street by an impertinent individual
with a camera, will be restrained in equity, on the ground that an
individual has the right to prevent his features from becoming known
to those outside of his circle of friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c007'>If such a principle be incorporated into the body of the law through
the instrumentality of a court of equity, the attempts to logically
apply the principle will necessarily result, not only in a vast amount of
litigation, but in litigation bordering upon the absurd, for the right
of privacy, once established as a legal doctrine, cannot be confined to
the restraint of the publication of a likeness, but must necessarily embrace
as well the publication of a word-picture, a comment upon one’s
looks, conduct, domestic relations, or habits. And were the right of
privacy once legally asserted, it would necessarily be held to include
the same things if spoken instead of printed, for one, as well as the
other, invades the right to be absolutely let alone. An insult would
certainly be in violation of such a right, and with many persons would
more seriously wound the feelings than would the publication of their
picture. And so we might add to the list of things that are spoken
and done day by day which seriously offend the sensibilities of good
people, to which the principle which the plaintiff seeks to have imbedded
in the doctrine of the law would seem to apply. I have gone
only far enough to barely suggest the vast field of litigation which
would necessarily be opened up should this court hold that privacy
exists as a legal right enforceable in equity by injunction, and by
damages where they seem necessary to give complete relief.</p>

<p class='c007'>The legislative body could very well interfere and arbitrarily provide
that no one should be permitted for his own selfish purpose to
use the picture or the name of another for advertising purposes without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_800'>800</span>his consent. In such event no embarrassment would result to the
general body of the law, for the rule would be applicable only to cases
provided for by the statute. The courts, however, being without authority
to legislate, are required to decide cases upon principle, and
so are necessarily embarrassed by precedents created by an extreme,
and, therefore, unjustifiable application of an old principle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court below properly said that “while it may be true that the
fact that no precedent can be found to sustain an action in any given
case is cogent evidence that a principle does not exist upon which
the right may be based, it is not the rule that the want of a precedent
is a sufficient reason for turning the plaintiff out of court,” provided—I
think should be added—there can be found a clear and unequivocal
principle of the common law which either directly or mediately
governs it or which by analogy or parity of reasoning ought to govern
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is undoubtedly true that in the early days of chancery jurisdiction
in England the chancellors were accustomed to deliver their
judgments without regard to principles or precedents, and in that way
the process of building up the system of equity went on, the chancellor
disregarding absolutely many established principles of the common
law. “In no other way,” says Pomeroy, “could the system of
equity jurisprudence have been commenced and continued so as to
arrive at its present proportions.” (Pomeroy’s Eq. Jur. sect. 48.) In
their work the chancellors were guided not only by what they regarded
as the eternal principles of absolute right, but also by their
individual consciences; but after a time when “the period of infancy
was passed and an orderly system of equitable principles, doctrines,
and rules began to be developed out of the increasing mass of precedents,
this theory of a personal conscience was abandoned; and ‘the
conscience,’ which is an element of the equitable jurisdiction, came
to be regarded, and has so continued to the present day, as a metaphorical
term, designating the common standard of civil right and
expediency combined, based upon general principles and limited by
established doctrines to which the court appeals, and by which it tests
the conduct and rights of suitors—a juridical and not a personal
conscience.” (Pomeroy’s Eq. Jur. sect. 57.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The importance of observing the spirit of this rule cannot be overestimated,
for, while justice in a given case may be worked out by a
decision of the court according to the notions of right which govern
the individual judge or body of judges comprising the court, the mischief
which will finally result may be almost incalculable under our
system which makes a decision in one case a precedent for decisions in
all future cases which are akin to it in the essential facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>So in a case like the one before us, which is concededly new to this
court, it is important that the court should have in mind the effect
upon future litigation and upon the development of the law which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_801'>801</span>would necessarily result from a step so far outside of the beaten paths
of both common law and equity, assuming—what I shall attempt to
show in a moment—that the right of privacy as a legal doctrine
enforceable in equity has not, down to this time, been established by
decisions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of the phrase “right of privacy” in this country seems
to have begun in 1890 in a clever article in the Harvard Law Review—already
referred to—in which a number of English cases were analyzed,
and, reasoning by analogy, the conclusion was reached that—notwithstanding
the unanimity of the courts in resting their decisions
upon property rights in cases where publication is prevented by injunction—in
reality such prevention was due to the necessity of
affording protection to thoughts and sentiments expressed through the
medium of writing, printing, and the arts, which is like the right not
to be assaulted or beaten; in other words, that the principle actually
involved though not always appreciated, was that of an inviolate personality,
not that of private property.</p>

<p class='c007'>This article brought forth a reply from the Northwestern Review
(Vol. III, page 1) urging that equity has no concern with the feelings
of an individual or with considerations of moral fitness, except as the
inconvenience or discomfort which the person may suffer is connected
with the possession or enjoyment of property, and that the English
authorities cited are consistent with such view. Those authorities are
now to be examined in order that we may see whether they were intended
to and did mark a departure from the established rule which
had been enforced for generations; or, on the other hand, are entirely
consistent with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The learned judge then commented upon various English cases;
also upon several American cases, especially Schuyler <em>v.</em> Curtis, 147
N. Y. 434; Atkinson <em>v.</em> Doherty, 121 Mich. 372; and Corliss <em>v.</em> E. W.
Walker Co., 57 Fed. Rep. 434. The point <em>actually decided</em> in 147
N. Y. 434 and in 121 Mich. 372 was that the widow or relatives of a
deceased person cannot restrain the erection of his statue or the publication
of his picture. In the Corliss case, the court declined to
grant the request of a widow that the publication of a biography
of her deceased husband should be enjoined; and finally (64 Fed.
Rep. 280) declined to restrain the publication of his picture. The
latter decision proceeded upon the ground that Mr. Corliss was a
public character.]</p>

<p class='c007'>This distinction between public and private characters cannot possibly
be drawn. On what principle does an author or artist forfeit
his right of privacy and a great orator, a great preacher, or a great
advocate retain his? Who can draw a line of demarcation between
public characters and private characters, let that line be as wavering
and irregular as you please? In the very case then before the judge,
what had Mr. Corliss done by which he surrendered his right of privacy?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_802'>802</span>In what respect did he by his inventions “ask for and desire
public recognition” any more than a banker or merchant who prosecutes
his calling? Or is the right of privacy the possession of mediocrity
alone, which a person forfeits by giving rein to his ability,
spurs to his industry, or grandeur to his character? A lady may pass
her life in domestic privacy when, by some act of heroism or self-sacrifice,
her name and fame fill the public ear. Is she to forfeit by
her good deed the right of privacy she previously possessed? These
considerations suggest the answer we would make to the position of
the learned judge and at the same time serve to make more clear what
we have elsewhere attempted to point out, namely, the absolute impossibility
of dealing with this subject save by legislative enactment,
by which may be drawn arbitrary distinctions which no court should
promulgate as a part of general jurisprudence.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>An examination of the authorities leads us to the conclusion that
the so-called “right of privacy” has not as yet found an abiding
place in our jurisprudence, and, as we view it, the doctrine cannot
now be incorporated without doing violence to settled principles of
law by which the profession and the public have long been guided.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not say that, even under the existing law, in every case of the
character of the one before us, or indeed in this case, a party whose
likeness is circulated against his will is without remedy. By section
245 of the Penal Code any malicious publication by picture, effigy, or
sign which exposes a person to contempt, ridicule, or obloquy is a libel,
and it would constitute such at common law. Malicious in this definition
means simply intentional and wilful. There are many articles,
especially of medicine, whose character is such that using the picture
of a person, particularly that of a woman, in connection with the advertisement
of those articles might justly be found by a jury to cast
ridicule or obloquy on the person whose picture was thus published.
The manner or posture in which the person is portrayed might readily
have a like effect. In such cases both a civil action and a criminal
prosecution could be maintained. But there is no allegation in the
complaint before us that this was the tendency of the publication
complained of, and the absence of such an allegation is fatal to the
maintenance of the action, treating it as one of libel. This case differs
from an action brought for libellous words. In such case the
alleged libel is stated in the complaint, and if the words are libellous
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, it is unnecessary to charge that their effect exposes the plaintiff
to disgrace, ridicule, or obloquy. The law attributes to them that result.
But where the libel is a picture which does not appear in the
record, to make it libellous there must be a proper allegation as to its
character.</p>

<p class='c007'>The judgment of the Appellate Division and of the Special Term
should be reversed and questions certified answered in the negative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_803'>803</span>without costs, and with leave to the plaintiff to serve an amended
complaint within twenty days, also without costs.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Gray, J.</span> (dissenting).</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>In the present case, we may not say that the plaintiff’s complaint
is fanciful, or that her alleged injury is, purely, a sentimental one.
Her objection to the defendants’ acts is not one born of caprice; nor
is it based upon the defendants’ act being merely “distasteful” to
her. We are bound to assume, and I find no difficulty in doing so, that
the conspicuous display of her likeness, in various public places, has
so humiliated her by the notoriety and by the public comments it has
provoked, as to cause her distress and suffering, in body and in mind,
and to confine her to her bed with illness.</p>

<p class='c007'>If it were necessary, to be entitled to equitable relief, that the plaintiff’s
sufferings, by reason of the defendants’ acts, should be serious,
and appreciable by a pecuniary standard, clearly, we might well say,
under the allegations of the complaint, that they were of such degree
of gravity. However, I am not of the opinion that the gravity of
the injury need be such as to be capable of being estimated by such
a standard. If the right of privacy exists and this complaint makes
out a case of its substantial violation, I think that the award of equitable
relief, by way of an injunction, preventing the continuance of its
invasion by the defendants, will not depend upon the complainant’s
ability to prove substantial pecuniary damages and, if the court finds
the defendants’ act to be without justification and for selfish gain and
purposes, and to be of such a character, as is reasonably calculated to
wound the feelings and to subject the plaintiff to the ridicule, or to
the contempt of others, that her right to the preventive relief of equity
will follow; without considering how far her sufferings may be
measurable by a pecuniary standard.</p>

<p class='c007'>The right of privacy, or the right of the individual to be let alone,
is a personal right, which is not without judicial recognition. It is
the complement of the right to the immunity of one’s person. The
individual has always been entitled to be protected in the exclusive
use and enjoyment of that which is his own. The common law regarded
his person and property as inviolate, and he has the absolute
right to be let alone. (Cooley on Torts, page 29.) The principle is
fundamental and essential in organized society that every one, in
exercising a personal right and in the use of his property, shall respect
the rights and properties of others. He must so conduct himself, in
the enjoyment of the rights and privileges which belong to him as a
member of society, as that he shall prejudice no one in the possession
and enjoyment of those which are exclusively his. When, as here,
there is an alleged invasion of some personal right, or privilege, the
absence of exact precedent and the fact that early commentators upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_804'>804</span>the common law have no discussion upon the subject are of no material
importance in awarding equitable relief. That the exercise of
the preventive power of a court of equity is demanded in a novel case,
is not a fatal objection.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>In an article in the Harvard Law Review, of December 15, 1890,
which contains an impressive argument upon the subject of the “right
of privacy,” it was well said by the authors “that the individual shall
have full protection in person and in property is a principle as old as
the common law; but it has been found necessary from time to time
to define anew the exact nature and extent of such protection....
The right to life had come to mean the right to enjoy life—the right
to be let alone; the right to liberty secures the exercise of extensive
civil privileges; and the term ‘property’ has grown to comprise every
form of possession—intangible as well as tangible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Instantaneous photography is a modern invention and affords the
means of securing a portraiture of an individual’s face and form <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in invitum</span></i>
their owner. While, so far forth as it merely does that, although
a species of aggression, I concede it to be an irremediable and irrepressible
feature of the social evolution. But, if it is to be permitted
that the portraiture may be put to commercial or other uses for gain,
by the publication of prints therefrom, then an act of invasion of the
individual’s privacy results, possibly more formidable and more painful
in its consequences than an actual bodily assault might be. Security
of person is as necessary as the security of property; and for that
complete personal security, which will result in the peaceful and
wholesome enjoyment of one’s privileges as a member of society,
there should be afforded protection, not only against the scandalous
portraiture and display of one’s features and person, but against the
display and use thereof for another’s commercial purposes or gain.
The proposition is, to me, an inconceivable one that these defendants
may, unauthorizedly, use the likeness of this young woman upon
their advertisement, as a method of attracting widespread public attention
to their wares, and that she must submit to the mortifying
notoriety, without right to invoke the exercise of the preventive power
of a court of equity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a view, as it seems to me, must have been unduly influenced
by a failure to find precedents in analogous cases, or some declaration
by the great commentators upon the law of a common-law principle
which would, precisely, apply to and govern the action; without
taking into consideration that, in the existing state of society, new
conditions affecting the relations of persons demand the broader extension
of those legal principles, which underlie the immunity of one’s
person from attack. I think that such a view is unduly restricted,
too, by a search for some property, which has been invaded by the
defendants’ act. Property is not, necessarily, the thing itself, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_805'>805</span>is owned; it is the right of the owner in relation to it. The right to
be protected in one’s possession of a thing, or in one’s privileges, belonging
to him as an individual, or secured to him as a member of the
commonwealth, is property, and as such entitled to the protection of
the law. The protective power of equity is not exercised upon the
tangible thing, but upon the right to enjoy it; and, so, it is called
forth for the protection of the right to that which is one’s exclusive
possession, as a property right. It seems to me that the principle,
which is applicable, is analogous to that upon which courts of equity
have interfered to protect the right of privacy, in cases of private
writings, or of other unpublished products of the mind. The writer,
or the lecturer, has been protected in his right to a literary property
in a letter, or a lecture, against its unauthorized publication; because
it is property, to which the right of privacy attaches. (Woolsey <em>v.</em>
Judd, 4 Duer, 399; Gee <em>v.</em> Pritchard, 2 Swanst. 402; Abernathy <em>v.</em>
Hutchinson, 3 L. J. Ch. 209; Folsom <em>v.</em> March, 2 Story, 100.) I
think that this plaintiff has the same property in the right to be
protected against the use of her face for defendant’s commercial
purposes, as she would have if they were publishing her literary compositions.
The right would be conceded, if she had sat for her photograph;
but if her face, or her portraiture, has a value, the value is
hers exclusively until the use be granted away to the public. Any
other principle of decision, in my opinion, is as repugnant to equity
as it is shocking to reason. Judge Colt, of the United States Court,
in Corliss <em>v.</em> Walker Co., 64 Fed. Rep. 280–285, a case involving the
same question of an invasion of the right of privacy, with respect to
the publication of a printed likeness of Mr. Corliss, expressed the
opinion that “independently of the question of contract, I believe
the law to be that a private individual has a right to be protected in
the representation of his portrait in any form; that this is a property
as well as a personal right; and that it belongs to the same class of
rights which forbids the reproduction of a private manuscript or painting,
or the publication of private letters, or of oral lectures delivered
by a teacher to his class, or the revelation of the contents of a merchant’s
books by a clerk.” The case itself is not in point in its facts;
because the complainant was the widow of Mr. Corliss, and thus it
came within the limitations of Schuyler <em>v.</em> Curtis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The right to grant the injunction does not depend upon the existence
of property, which one has in some contractual form. It depends
upon the existence of property in any right which belongs to a person.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>It would be, in my opinion, an extraordinary view which, while conceding
the right of a person to be protected against the unauthorized
circulation of an unpublished lecture, letter, drawing, or other ideal
property, yet would deny the same protection to a person whose portrait
was unauthorizedly obtained, and made use of, for commercial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_806'>806</span>purposes. The injury to the plaintiff is irreparable; because she cannot
be wholly compensated in damages for the various consequences
entailed by defendants’ acts. The only complete relief is an injunction
restraining their continuance. Whether, as incidental to that
equitable relief, she should be able to recover only nominal damages is
not material; for the issuance of the injunction does not, in such a
case, depend upon the amount of the damages in dollars and cents.</p>

<p class='c007'>A careful consideration of the question presented upon this appeal
leads me to the conclusion that the judgment appealed from should
be affirmed.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>DAVIES <em>v.</em> GARDINER<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Common Pleas, Trinity Term, 1593.</span><br /> <em>Reported in Popham, 36.</em><a id='r529'></a><a href='#f529' class='c015'><sup>[529]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c014'>An action upon the case for a slander was brought by Anne Davies
against John Gardiner; That whereas there was a communication of a
marriage to be had between the plaintiff and one Anthony Elcock, the
defendant, to the intent to hinder the said marriage, said and published
that there was a grocer in London that did get her with child,
and that she had the child by the said grocer, whereby she lost her
marriage. To which the defendant pleaded not guilty, and was found
guilty at the assizes at Aylesbury, to the damage of 200 marks. And
now it was alleged, in arrest of judgment, that this matter appeareth
to be merely spiritual, and therefore not determinable at common law,
but to be prosecuted in the spiritual court. But <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per Curiam</span></i> the action
lies here, for a woman not married cannot by intendment have so great
advancement as by her marriage, whereby she is sure of maintenance
for her life, or during her marriage, and dower and other benefits which
the temporal law gives by reason of her marriage; and therefore by
this slander she is greatly prejudiced in that which is to be her temporal
advancement, for which it is reason to give her remedy by way of
action at common law. As if a woman keep a victualling house, to
which divers of great credit repair, whereby she hath her livelihood,
and one will say to her guests, that as they respect their credits, they
take care how they use such a house, for there the woman is known to
be a bawd, whereby the guests avoid her house, to the loss of her husband,
shall not she in this case have an action at common law for such
a slander? It is clear that she will. So, if one saith that a woman is a
common strumpet, and that it is a slander to them to come to her
house, whereby she loseth the advantage which she was wont to have
by her guests, she shall have her action for this at common law.</p>

<p class='c007'>So here upon these collateral circumstances, whereby it may appear
that she hath more prejudice than can be by calling of one harlot, and

<p class='c014'>Declaration.—That, before the committing of the grievances,
the said Hannah was the wife of the plaintiff, William Allsop; and the
defendant, on divers occasions, falsely and maliciously spoke and published
of the plaintiff Hannah the words following (to the effect that
he had had carnal connection with her whilst she was the wife of the
plaintiff, William Allsop): “Whereby the plaintiff Hannah lost the
society of her friends and neighbors, and they refused to, and did not,
associate with her as they otherwise would have done, and she was
much injured in her credit and reputation, and brought into public
scandal and disgrace; and, by reason of the committing of the grievances,
the said Hannah became and was ill and unwell for a long time
and unable to attend to her necessary affairs and business, and the
plaintiff, William Allsop, was put to and incurred much expense in and
about the endeavoring to cure her of the illness which she labored

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pollock, C. B.</span> We are all of opinion that the defendant is entitled
to judgment. There is no precedent for any such special damage as
that laid in this declaration being made a ground of action, so as to
render words actionable which otherwise would not be so. We ought
to be careful not to introduce a new element of damage, recollecting
to what a large class of actions it would apply, and what a dangerous
use might be made of it. In actions for making false charges before
magistrates, for giving false characters, and for torts of all kinds,
illness might be said to have arisen from the wrong sustained by the
plaintiff. The case of Ford <em>v.</em> Monroe, 20 Wendell, 210, is the only
authority that has any tendency to throw light on the argument; but
we ought not to act upon the authority of that case, opposed as it is to
the universal practice of the law in this country. The courts here have
always taken care that parties shall not be responsible for fanciful or
remote damages, or, in fact, any that do not fairly and naturally result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_809'>809</span>from the wrongful act itself. It is only lately that a clear and distinct
view of the subject of damages was taken, in Hadley <em>v.</em> Baxendale, 9
Exch. 341, in which it was held that a person whose duty it is to deliver
goods to another is not responsible for any damages resulting
from the non-delivery, unless they are the damages which would result
immediately and naturally, that is, according to the usual course of
things, from the breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably
be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the
time they made contract. Slander may be repeated, and the repetition
may cause mischief. In one sense nothing is more natural than that
such should be the case. So there are many other consequences which
may follow in libel and slander in respect of which there is no remedy.
This particular damage depends on the temperament of the party
affected, and it may be laid down that illness arising from the excitement
which the slanderous language may produce is not that sort of
damage which forms a ground of action.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Blackburn, J.</span><a id='r533'></a><a href='#f533' class='c015'><sup>[533]</sup></a> The sole difficulty in deciding the case is caused
by the opinion of Lord Wensleydale in Lynch <em>v.</em> Knight, 9 H. L. C.
577. He held that no action would lie for slander of a wife when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_810'>810</span>only special damage alleged was the loss to the plaintiff of the consortium
of her husband. In the present case, however, it is unnecessary
to decide this question, for the declaration, after alleging the loss
of cohabitation by the wife, proceeds to aver that “she lost, and was
deprived of the companionship, and ceased to receive the hospitality
of divers friends.” Now, first, was that consequence such as might
reasonably and naturally be expected to follow from the speaking of
the slanderous words? Judging from the habits and manners of
society, of all the consequences that might be expected to result from
a statement that a woman had committed adultery, or had been guilty
of unchastity, the most natural would be that those who had invited
her and given her hospitality would thenceforth cease to do so. Then
Moore <em>v.</em> Meagher, 1 Taunt. 39, decides that the loss of the hospitality
of friends is sufficient special damage to sustain an action like the
present, and the hospitality, as the word is there used, means simply
that persons receive another into their houses, and give him meat and
drink gratis. Perhaps such a definition may rather extend the signification
of the word, but it is true in effect—for if they do not receive
him, or if they make him pay for his entertainment, that is not
hospitality. In Roberts <em>v.</em> Roberts, 5 B. &amp; S. 384, 33 L. J. Q. B. 249,
it is to be observed, that the loss suffered by the plaintiff in being excluded
from a religious society was not temporal, and was therefore
held not to be enough. But in the present case there is a matter of
temporal damage—small though it be—laid in the declaration. It
is also argued, that inasmuch as this action is brought by the wife,
the husband being merely joined for conformity, the damage necessary
to give a right to recover must be damage to her alone, and that
the loss of hospitality which she has hitherto enjoyed is only pecuniary
loss to her husband, and not to her. That certainly is a plausible
argument, as the husband is of course bound to maintain his wife
and to supply her with food, although her friends cease to do so. I
am, however, unwilling to agree with such artificial reasoning, and I
think that the real damage in this case is to the wife herself. Notwithstanding
that it is the husband’s duty to support his wife, he is
only bound to provide her with necessaries suitable to his station in
life; and she might, by visiting friends in a higher position than himself,
enjoy luxuries which he either could not or might not choose to
afford her. But I should be sorry to say that we must enter into a
nice inquiry as to whether such hospitality would save the purse of the
husband or of the wife. I am therefore of opinion that the declaration
is good; and the demurrer must be overruled.</p>

<p class='c014'>Defamation.—The summons and plaint stated the speaking of
words imputing prostitution to the plaintiff Anne, and calling her a
vagabond, with an innuendo that this word imputed that she was a
vagrant without a fixed place of abode. By means of the committing
of which several grievances, the said plaintiff Anne hath been injured
in her credit and reputation, and brought into disgrace with her acquaintances,
in so much that her brother K. Dooley, who had promised
to supply the said Anne with means to enable her to emigrate to
Australia to join her husband, has now, in consequence of the imputations
cast upon her character by the said defendant, retracted his
promise until the truth or falsehood of the said charges shall have been
first ascertained and established; whereby, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Demurrer.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pennefather, B.</span><a id='r534'></a><a href='#f534' class='c015'><sup>[534]</sup></a> It certainly does strike me that this summons
and plaint would not be good without the allegation of special damage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, as to the special damage laid. I certainly agree that mere
apprehension of damage would not be a sufficient statement; but here
a promise has been laid. It is argued that no averment of the promisor’s
intention to perform it has been made, but I think it must be
taken that he intended to perform it, until the contrary be shown. In
cases of actions for breach of promise, as, for instance, of marriage,
there is never any allegation contained to that effect, nor could it be
maintained that, without such an averment, the pleading would not be
sufficient.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then follows an allegation here that, by reason of the speaking of
the words, the promisor retracted his promise, and broke off his treaty
of giving the plaintiff funds to enable her to emigrate. Now, if the
words stopped there, I think there is no question whatever but there
was special damage sustained by the breach of a promise which must
have been beneficial to the plaintiff. The demurrer must be overruled.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first count stated that the defendant falsely and maliciously
published of the plaintiff, a stone-mason, and employed as such in
certain works carried on by one Mayberry, these words: “He was the
ringleader of the nine-hours system,” whereby and by means of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_812'>812</span>premises the plaintiff was injured in his occupation of a stone-mason,
and was discharged from his said employment at the said works, to
wit, the Old Castle Iron and Tin Plate Works, and was without and
could not obtain employment for a considerable time, and could get
no employment but one of less value to the plaintiff, the place of employment
being distant from his place of abode, and his necessary
meals thereby becoming more costly, and such place of employment
being exposed to wet weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second count was similar, except that the words spoken were:
“He has ruined the town by bringing about the nine hours system,
and he has stopped several good jobs from being carried out, by being
the ringleader of the system at Llanelly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Demurrer, on the ground that the words were not in themselves
defamatory, and that special damage consequent thereon, therefore,
gave no action. Joinder in demurrer.<a id='r535'></a><a href='#f535' class='c015'><sup>[535]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Jan. 20. The judgment of the court (<span class='sc'>Lord Coleridge, C. J.</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Keating</span>, <span class='sc'>Brett</span>, and <span class='sc'>Denman</span>, JJ.) was delivered by</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Coleridge, C. J.</span> In this case time was taken to consider
our judgment, from the wish entertained by at least one member of
the court to hold, if there were authority for the proposition, that a
statement false and malicious made by one person in regard to another,
whereby that other might probably, under some circumstances,
and at the hands of some persons, suffer damage, would, if the damage
resulted in fact, support an action for defamation. No proposition less
wide in its terms than this would support the present declaration;
for to call a man “the ringleader of the nine hours system,” and to say
of him that he “had ruined a place by bringing about that system,”
could not under many circumstances and at the hands of many people
do the subject of such statement any damage at all. But we are unable
to find any authority for a proposition so wide and general in its terms
as would alone support this action.<a id='r536'></a><a href='#f536' class='c015'><sup>[536]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The rule, as laid down by De Grey, C. J., in Onslow <em>v.</em> Horne, that
words are actionable if they be of probable ill consequence to a person
in a trade or profession, or an office, is expressly disapproved of by the
Court of Exchequer in Lumby <em>v.</em> Allday. Bayley, B., there says:
“Every authority which I have been able to find either shows the
want of some general requisite, as honesty, capacity, fidelity, or the
like, or connects the imputation with the plaintiff’s office, trade, or
business.” In that case, the words proved were a very strong imputation
on the morality of the plaintiff, who was a clerk to a gas company.
But the court held them not actionable, because the imputation conveyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_813'>813</span>by them did not imply the want of any of those qualities which
a clerk ought to possess, and because the imputation had no reference
to his conduct as clerk. That case and the language of Bayley, B., in
delivering the judgment of the court, have since been repeatedly approved
of, and are really decisive of this case.</p>

<p class='c007'>The words before us are not actionable in themselves. No expression
in them was argued to be so except the word “ringleader;” and,
as to that, it is sufficient perhaps to say that Dr. Johnson points out
the mistake of supposing that the word is by any means necessarily a
word of bad import; for, amongst other authorities, he cites Barrow
as calling St. Peter the “ringleader” of the Apostles.<a id='r537'></a><a href='#f537' class='c015'><sup>[537]</sup></a> Neither are
the words connected with the trade or profession of the plaintiff, either
by averment or by implication; so that, on neither ground can the
declaration be supported. There is no averment here that the consequence
which followed was intended by the defendant as the result
of his words; and therefore it is not necessary to consider the question
which was suggested on the argument, whether words not in themselves
actionable or defamatory spoken under circumstances and to
persons likely to create damage to the subject of the words, are, when
the damage follows, ground of action. The judgment of Lord Wensleydale
in Lynch <em>v.</em> Knight, 9 H. L. C., at p. 600, appears in favor of
the affirmative of this question. But it is not necessary for us, for the
reasons given, to express any opinion upon it; and upon this demurrer
there must be judgment for the defendant.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Day, J.</span><a id='r538'></a><a href='#f538' class='c015'><sup>[538]</sup></a> This is an application to set aside a nonsuit, which was
directed by the Lord Chief Justice on the opening statement of counsel,
and the question is whether the nonsuit was properly entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statement of claim alleged that the defendants wrote and published
“of and concerning the plaintiff and his said trade as a wine-merchant
and importer the following false and malicious libel, that is
to say:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Caution: Delmonico Champagne. Messrs. Delbeck &amp; Co., finding
that wine stated to be Delmonico champagne is being advertised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_814'>814</span>for sale in Great Britain, hereby give notice that such wine cannot be
the wine it is represented to be, as no champagne shipped under that
name can be genuine unless it has their names on their labels. Messrs.
Delbeck &amp; Co. further give notice that if such wine be shipped from
France they will take proceedings to stop such shipments, and such
other proceedings in England as they may be advised,’ thereby meaning
that the plaintiff had no right to use his said registered trade-mark
or brand for champagne imported or sold by him, and that in
using such trade-mark or brand he was acting fraudulently, and endeavoring
to pass off an inferior champagne as being of the manufacture
of Messrs. Delbeck &amp; Co., and that the champagne imported and
sold by the plaintiff was not genuine wine, and that no person other
than the defendants had the right to use the word ‘Delmonico’ as a
trade-mark or brand, or part of a trade-mark or brand, of champagne
in the United Kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The publication there set out is complained of as a libel on the
plaintiff in relation to his trade. It is substantially a warning not to
buy Delmonico champagne because it is not genuine. The statement
of claim alleges that the publication is false and malicious; that would
be a question for the jury; it is not for us to consider the facts of the
case; we can only look at what was opened by the plaintiff’s counsel
and what appears on the pleadings. The innuendo charges that the
defendants intended to convey the meaning that the plaintiff had no
right to use his trade-mark or brand, and that the wine he sold was not
genuine. It may be that the publication bears that meaning, and that
the words used import dishonesty. The plaintiff has died, and the
question to be decided is how much, if any part, of the cause of action
survives. The statute 4 Edw. 3, c. 7, and the course of practice, make
it clear that a civil action for libel dies with the death of the person
libelled. It does not come within the spirit, and certainly not within
the letter of the statute. There is, however, a further question
whether a right of action can survive because injury to the plaintiff’s
trade-mark is alleged. Injury to trade is constantly alleged in actions
for libel, and therefore that does not affect the question of survivorship.
In the present case the second part of the statement of claim
may be subdivided into two separate and distinct claims. The first is
for ordinary defamation, either independently of the plaintiff’s trade,
affecting his character by charging him with being a dishonest man, or
defamation of him in his trade by charging him with being a dishonest
wine-merchant. That claim would not survive, for it is nothing more
than a claim in respect of a libel on an individual. But this publication
may be construed to mean that the plaintiff had no right to use his
trade-mark. This is not properly a libel, but is rather in the nature of
slander of title, which is well defined in Odgers on Libel and Slander,
c. v. p. 137, in the following passage: “But wholly apart from these
cases there is a branch of the law (generally known by the inapproriate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_815'>815</span>but convenient name—slander of title) which permits an action
to be brought against any one who maliciously decries the plaintiff’s
goods or some other thing belonging to him, and thereby produces
special damage to the plaintiff. This is obviously no part of the law of
defamation, for the plaintiff’s reputation remains uninjured; it is
really an action on the case for maliciously acting in such a way as to
inflict loss upon the plaintiff. All the preceding rules dispensing with
proof of malice and special damage are therefore wholly inapplicable
to cases of this kind. Here, as in all other actions on the case, there
must be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et damnum et injuria</span></i>. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">injuria</span></i> consists in the unlawful
words maliciously spoken, and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum</span></i> is the consequent money
loss to the plaintiff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears, therefore, that the first and last parts of the innuendo in
the present case suggest slander of title. As appears from the passage
I have read, an action for slander of title is not an action for
libel, but is rather in the nature of an action on the case for maliciously
injuring a person in respect of his estate by asserting that he
has no title to it. The action differs from an action for libel in this,
that malice is not implied from the fact of publication, but must be
proved, and that the falsehood of the statement complained of, and the
existence of special damage, must also be proved in order to entitle the
plaintiff to recover. The question whether the publication is false and
malicious is for the jury. Here, I think, special damage is alleged by
the statement of claim, and if the plaintiff could have shown injury to
the sale of the wine which he sold under his trade-mark, he would have
been entitled to recover, and that is a cause of action which survives.</p>

<p class='c007'>For these reasons I am of opinion that the nonsuit was right so far
as it related to the claim in respect of a personal libel, but was wrong
as to the claim in respect of so much of the publication as impugned
the plaintiff’s right to sell under his trade-mark or brand.</p>

<p class='c007'>There will, therefore, be an order for a new trial, but it will be
limited to this latter part of the claim.</p>

  <h4 class='c013'>MALACHY <em>v.</em> SOPER<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Common Pleas, November 25, 1836.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 3 Bingham, New Cases, 371.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Tindal, C. J.</span><a id='r540'></a><a href='#f540' class='c015'><sup>[540]</sup></a> In this case a verdict having been found for the
plaintiff at the trial of the cause with £5 damages, a motion has been
made to arrest the judgment on the ground that the declaration does
not state any legal cause of action. And we are of opinion that this
objection is well founded; and that the judgment must be arrested.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is not an ordinary action for defamation of the person, by the
publication of slander either oral or written; in which form of action
no special damage need either be alleged or proved; the law presuming
that the uttering of the slanderous words, or the publishing of the libel,
have of themselves a natural and necessary tendency to injure the
plaintiff. But this is an action to recover damages by reason of the
publication of a paragraph in a newspaper, which contains no other
charge than that the “petition in a bill filed in the Court of Chancery
against the plaintiff, and certain other persons as share-owners in a
certain mine, for an account and an injunction, had been granted by
the Vice-Chancellor, and that persons duly authorized had arrived
in the workings.” The publication therefore is one which slanders not
the person or character of the plaintiff, but his title as one of the shareholders
to the undisputed possession and enjoyment of his shares of
the mine. And the objection taken is, that the plaintiff, in order to
maintain this action, must show a special damage to have happened
from the publication, and that this declaration shows none.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first question therefore is, does the law require in such an action
an allegation of special damage? And looking at the authorities we
think they all point the same way. The law is clearly laid down in Sir
W. Jones, 196 (Lowe <em>v.</em> Harewood): “of slander of title, the plaintiff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_817'>817</span>shall not maintain action, unless it was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">re vera</span></i> a damage; <em>scil.</em>, that
he was hindered in sale of his land; so there the particular damage
ought to be alleged.” And in addition to the cases cited at the bar,
viz., Sir John Tasborough <em>v.</em> Day, Cro. Jac. 484, and Manning <em>v.</em>
Avery, Keb. 153, the case of Cane <em>v.</em> Goulding, Style’s Rep. 169, 176,
furnishes a strong authority. That was an action on the case for slandering
the plaintiff’s title, by speaking these words, viz., “his right
and title thereunto is nought, and I have a better title than he.” The
words were alleged to be spoken <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">falso et malitiose</span></i>, and that he was
likely to sell, and was injured by the words; and that by reason of
speaking the words, he could not recover his tithes. After verdict for
the plaintiff, there was a motion in arrest of judgment; and Rolle,
C. J., said, “there ought to be a scandal and a particular damage set
forth, and there is not here;” and upon its being moved again and
argued by the judges, Rolle, C. J., held that the action did not lie,
although it was alleged that the words were spoken <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">falso et malitiose</span></i>
for “the plaintiff ought to have a special cause; but that, the verdict
might supply; but the plaintiff ought also to have showed a special
damage which he hath not done, and this the verdict cannot supply:
the declaration here is too general, and upon which no good issue can
be joined; and he ought to have alleged, that there was a communication
had before the words spoken touching the sale of the lands
whereof the title was slandered, and that by speaking of them the
sale was hindered;” and cited several cases to that effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>We hold, therefore, on the authority of these cases, that an action
for slander of title is not properly an action for words spoken, or for
libel written and published, but an action on the case for special damage
sustained by reason of the speaking or publication of the slander
of the plaintiff’s title. This action is ranged under that division of
actions in the Digests, and other writers on the text law, and such we
feel bound to hold it to remain at the present day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next question is, has there been such a special damage alleged
in this case, as will satisfy the rule laid down by the authorities above
referred to? The doctrine of the older cases is, that the plaintiff ought
to aver that, by the speaking, he could not sell or lease (Cro. Eliz. 197,
Cro. Car. 140); and that it will not be sufficient to say only, that he
had an intent to sell, without alleging a communication for sale (R. 1
Roll. 244). Admitting, however, that these may be put as instances
only, and that there may be many more cases in which a particular
damage may be equally apparent without such allegation, they establish
at least this, that in the action for slander of title, there must be
an express allegation of some particular damage resulting to the plaintiff
from such slander. Now the allegation upon this record is only
this, “that the plaintiff is injured in his rights; and the shares so possessed
by him, and in which he is interested, have been and are much
depreciated and lessened in value; and divers persons have believed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_818'>818</span>and do believe that he has little or no right to the shares, and that the
mine cannot be lawfully worked or used for his benefit; and that he
hath been hindered and prevented from selling or disposing of his said
shares in the said mine, and from working and using the same in so
ample and beneficial a manner as he otherwise would have done.”
And we are of opinion that this is not such an allegation of special
damage as the authorities above referred to require, where the action
is not founded on the words spoken or written, but upon the special
damage sustained.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been argued in support of the present action, that it is not so
much an action for slander of title as an action for a libel on the plaintiff
in the course of his business, and in the way of gaining his livelihood,
and that such an action is strictly and properly an action for
defamation, and so classed and held by all the authorities. But we
think it sufficient to advert to the declaration, to be convinced that the
publication complained of was really and strictly a slander of the
plaintiff’s title to his shares, and nothing else. The bill in Chancery,
out of which the publication arose, is filed by Tollervy, who disputed
the plaintiff’s right to the whole of the shares, and claimed in himself
a right to part of the same, and prayed that he might be declared to be
entitled to some of them and the only mention made as to the working
of the mines, was with reference to the appointment of a receiver to
the profits thereof. And we think it would be doing violence to the
natural meaning of the terms of the publication, if we were to hold it
to be published of the plaintiff in the course of his business or occupation,
or mode of acquiring his livelihood, and not as referring to the
disputed title of the shares of the mine.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been urged, secondly, that however necessary it may be, according
to the ancient authorities, to allege some particular damage in
cases of unwritten slander of title, the case of written slander stands
on different grounds; and that an action may be maintained without
an allegation of damage actually sustained, if the plaintiff’s right be
impeached by a written publication, which of itself, it is contended, affords
presumption of injury to the plaintiff. No authority whatever
has been cited in support of this distinction. And we are of opinion
that the necessity for an allegation of actual damage in the case of
slander of title, cannot depend upon the medium through which that
slander is conveyed, that is, whether it be through words, or writing,
or print; but that it rests on the nature of the action itself, namely,
that it is an action for special damage actually sustained, and not an
action for slander. The circumstance of the slander of title being conveyed
in a letter or other publication appears to us to make no other
difference than that it is more widely and permanently disseminated,
and the damages in consequence more likely to be serious than where
the slander of title is by words only; but that it makes no difference
whatever in the legal ground of action.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_819'>819</span>For these reasons we are of opinion, that the action is not maintainable,
and that the judgment must be arrested; and, consequently, it
becomes unnecessary to inquire whether the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">innuendo</span></i> laid in the
declaration is more large than it ought to have been.</p>

<p class='c007'>We therefore make the rule for arresting the judgment,</p>

<h4 class='c013'>WHITE <em>v.</em> MELLIN<br /> <span class='sc'>In the House of Lords, February 14, 1895.</span><br /> <em>Reported in [1895] Appeal Cases, 154.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>The respondent was the proprietor of Mellin’s food for infants,
which he sold in bottles enclosed in wrappers bearing the words “Mellin’s
Infants’ Food.” The respondent was in the habit of supplying
the appellant with these bottles, which the appellant sold again to the
public after affixing on the respondent’s wrappers a label as follows:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c024'>
    <div>“Notice.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>“The public are recommended to try Dr. Vance’s prepared food for
infants and invalids, it being far more nutritious and healthful than
any other preparation yet offered. Sold in barrels, each containing
1 lb. nett weight, at 7½<em>d.</em> each, or in 7 lb. packets 3<em>s.</em> 9<em>d.</em> each. Local
agent, Timothy White, chemist, Portsmouth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The appellant was the proprietor of Vance’s food. Discovering
this practice, the respondent brought an action against the appellant,
claiming an injunction to restrain him and damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial before Romer, J., the plaintiff proved the above facts,
and called two analysts and a physician, the result of whose evidence
is stated in Lord Herschell’s judgment. Briefly, they testified that in
their opinion Mellin’s food was suitable for infants, especially up to
the age of six months, and persons who could not digest starchy matters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_820'>820</span>and that Vance’s food was unsuitable for such beings, nay pernicious
and dangerous for very young infants. At the close of the
plaintiff’s case Romer, J., being of opinion that the label was merely
the puff of a rival trader and that no cause of action was disclosed,
dismissed the action with costs. The Court of Appeal (Lindley,
Lopes, and Kay, L.JJ.) being of opinion that the cause ought to have
been heard out, discharged that judgment and ordered a new trial,
[1894] 3 Ch. 276.<a id='r542'></a><a href='#f542' class='c015'><sup>[542]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Herschell, L. C.</span> (after stating the facts):—</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, in the Court of Appeal Lindley, L. J., stated the law
thus: “If upon hearing the whole of the evidence to be adduced before
him the result should be that the statement contained in the
label complained of is a false statement about the plaintiff’s goods to
the disparagement of them, and if that statement has caused injury
to or is calculated to injure the plaintiff, this action will lie.” Lopes,
L. J., said: “All I desire to say is that, in my opinion, it is actionable
to publish maliciously without lawful occasion a false statement
disparaging the goods of another person and causing such other person
damage, or likely to cause such other person damage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>None of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal dealt with the
evidence which had been adduced on behalf of the plaintiff; but I
think it must be taken that they had arrived at the conclusion that
that evidence did bring the case within those statements of the law.
Of course, if the plaintiff, on his evidence, had made out no case, he
could not complain that the learned judge decided against him and
did not hear the witnesses for the defendant; the action was in that
case properly dismissed. I take it, therefore, that although the learned
judges did not analyse the evidence or make any reference to it, they
must have concluded that it established a case coming within the law
as they laid it down. My Lords, as I understand, in the view of
those learned judges, or in the view of Lindley, L. J., to take his
statement of the law in the first place, it was necessary in order to
the maintenance of the action that three things should be proved:
that the defendant had disparaged the plaintiff’s goods, that such disparagement
was false, and that damage had resulted or was likely to
result. Now, my Lords, the only statement made by the defendant
by means of the advertisement is this: that Vance’s food was the
most healthful and nutritious for infants and invalids that had been
offered to the public. The statement was perfectly general, and would
apply in its terms not only to the respondent’s infants’ food but to all
others that were offered to the public. I will take it as sufficiently
pointed at the plaintiff’s food by reason of its being affixed to a bottle
of the plaintiff’s food when sold, and that it does disparage the plaintiff’s
goods by asserting that they are not as healthful and as nutritious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_821'>821</span>as those recommended by the defendant. The question then
arises, Has it been proved on the plaintiff’s own evidence that that was
a false disparagement of the plaintiff’s goods?</p>

<p class='c007'>I will state what I understand to be the result of the plaintiff’s
evidence. Mellin’s food for infants and invalids is a preparation of
such a nature that the food is said to be predigested, and therefore
not to make that call upon the digestion which food ordinarily does;
that as regards children under six months of age Mellin’s food is the
only one which could be suitably used in the place of the ordinary
means of nourishment, the mother’s milk, and that any farinaceous
food would at that age be not only not nutritious but prejudicial. And
so far, accepting the plaintiff’s evidence for this purpose, there being
no evidence to the contrary, the plaintiff, I think, establishes that his
food was specially meritorious for that class of cases, and that it
would not be correct to say that as regards these children of very
tender age Vance’s food or any other farinaceous food would be not
only more healthful and nutritious, but as healthful and nutritious.
But then it appears that when a child has passed the age up to which
nutrition at the breast may ordinarily be said to continue, the use of
some farinaceous food is not only not prejudicial but desirable, and
that if the child were to be always brought up upon a food which
would be suitable during the very earliest weeks or months, its digestion
would be likely to suffer rather than benefit, and there would be
not more, but less nourishment. After twelve months, as I understand
the evidence, the farinaceous food would be distinctly better
for the purposes of nutrition and health than this predigested food.
That, my Lords, I take to be a fair statement of the result of the evidence.
Can it be said, under those circumstances, that it is a false
disparagement of the plaintiff’s goods to say that this other preparation—Vance’s—is
more nutritious and healthful for infants and
invalids? I put aside the question of invalids: upon that there was
no evidence at all. The plaintiff did not say that his was more healthful,
or that the defendant’s was not more healthful. It is therefore
unnecessary to consider the case of invalids, and it is enough to confine
one’s attention to the case of infants.</p>

<p class='c007'>The word “infants” is not in ordinary parlance confined to children
of very tender age. If one looks at its derivation etymologically it
would apply to children so long as they are not able to articulate distinctly—not
able to speak—and nobody would hesitate to refer to
children, I should say, at least under two years of age as infants, just
as much as they would to children under six months of age. Therefore,
if you look at the class of infants as a whole, it is by no means
shown that the statement that Vance’s food is more nutritious and
healthful than the plaintiff’s food is false. If the reference had been
specially to that very early period of life during which Mellin’s food
would be beneficial and the other prejudicial, no doubt a statement of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_822'>822</span>that description might well be said to be a false statement; but looking
fairly at the language used and the meaning to be attributed to
it, I am not satisfied that it has been shown that by means of this
advertisement the defendant falsely disparaged the plaintiff’s goods.
But, my Lords, assuming that he did so, the Court of Appeal regarded
it as requisite for the maintenance of the action that something further
should be proved, and that is that the disparaging statement has
caused injury to or is calculated to injure the plaintiff. Upon that
there is a complete absence of evidence. The plaintiff was called,
but he did not state that he had sustained any injury, nor did he even
say that it was calculated to injure him, and I own it seems to me
impossible, in the absence of any such statement or evidence, to say
that it is a case in which such must be the necessary consequence; on
the contrary, speaking for myself, I should doubt very much whether
it was likely to be the consequence. After all, the advertisement is
of a very common description, puffing, it may be, extremely and in an
exaggerated fashion, these particular goods, Vance’s food. That advertisement
was outside the wrapper; inside was found an advertisement
of Mellin’s food, in which Mellin’s food was stated to be
recommended by the faculty as best for infants and invalids. Why
is it to be supposed that any one buying this bottle at the chemist’s
would be led to believe that Mellin’s food which he had bought was
not a good article or not as good an article as another, merely because
a person who obviously was seeking to push a rival article said that
his article was better? My Lords, why should people give such a
special weight to this anonymous puff of Vance’s food, obviously the
work of some one who wanted to sell it, as that it should lead him to
determine to buy it instead of Mellin’s food, which was said to be
recommended by the faculty as the best for infants and invalids? I
confess I do not wonder that the plaintiff did not insist that he had
sustained injury by what the defendant had done. There is an entire
absence of any evidence that the statement complained of either had
injured or was calculated to injure the plaintiff. If so, then the case
is not brought even within the definition of the law which Lindley,
L. J., gives.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lopes, L. J., adds the word “maliciously,” that “it is actionable
to publish maliciously without lawful occasion a false statement disparaging
the goods of another person.” By that it may be intended
to indicate that the object of the publication must be to injure another
person, and that the advertisement is not published <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>
merely to sell the advertiser’s own goods, or at all events, that he
published it with a knowledge of its falsity. One or other of those
elements, it seems to me, must be intended by the addition of the
word “maliciously.” Both those are certainly absent here. There
is nothing to show that the object of the defendant was other than to
puff his own goods and so sell them, nor is there anything to show
that he did not believe that his food was better than any other.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_823'>823</span>The only case which the learned counsel for the respondent was
able to rely upon as at all approaching the present is the case of the
Western Counties Manure Company <em>v.</em> Lawes Chemical Manure Company,
L. R. 9 Ex. 218, in which case a declaration was held good
which alleged the disparagement of the plaintiff’s goods by stating that
they were inferior to those sold by the defendants.<a id='r543'></a><a href='#f543' class='c015'><sup>[543]</sup></a> In that case special
damage was alleged in the declaration, and I think that that allegation
was regarded by both the learned judges who were parties to
the decision as material and essential. In the earlier case of Evans <em>v.</em>
Harlow, 5 Q. B. 624, a statement was complained of which distinctly
disparaged the plaintiff’s goods. It cautioned the public against
them, it pointed out to the public that they were not likely to realize
the purpose for which they were designed, and the allegation was that
“the defendant published a libel of and concerning the plaintiff and
of and concerning him in his said trade and of and concerning his design
as follows.” In that case there was no allegation of special damage;
there was a demurrer to the declaration, and the declaration was
held bad. Now, the only distinction that I can see between that case
and the case of the Western Counties Manure Company <em>v.</em> Lawes
Chemical Manure Company is that in the latter case special damage
was alleged, whereas in the former it was not. Bramwell, B., does not
call specific attention to the differentia between the case before him
and the case of Evans <em>v.</em> Harlow, but he says that there is nothing in
any of the cases inconsistent with the judgment which he is pronouncing.
Pollock, B., who was the other judge, pointed out that in Evans
<em>v.</em> Harlow there was no allegation of special damage. Therefore, my
Lords, the utmost that the Western Counties Manure Company <em>v.</em>
Lawes Chemical Manure Company, L. R. 9 Ex. 218, can be claimed
as an authority for is this, that an action will lie for falsely disparaging
another’s goods where special damage results. Evans <em>v.</em> Harlow, 5
Q. B. 624, is a distinct authority that it will not lie where special damage
does not result. In the present case it cannot be pretended that
any special damage was either alleged or proved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Moulton sought to extricate himself from that difficulty in this
way: he said that if this were an action for damages that might be a
well-founded objection to it, but that it is not an action for damages
but a claim for an injunction, and that although it may be that to
support an action for damages it would be necessary to allege and
prove special damage, that is not necessary where an injunction is
claimed—that it is enough if a false statement is made and is likely
to be repeated.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_824'>824</span>Now my Lords, no authority was cited to show that a Court of
Equity under any of the branches of its jurisdiction had ever granted
or would grant an injunction in such a case. Certainly there is no
rule of equity under which it may be said generally that a Court of
Equity would restrain every publication of a false statement. In the
case of Canham <em>v.</em> Jones, 2 V. &amp; B. 218, the bill stated that a certain
Mr. Swainson had been the sole proprietor of a secret for preparing
the medicine called “Velno’s Vegetable Syrup,” and that the plaintiff
had obtained title to it under his will and had sold the medicine.
Then the complaint was that the defendant, who had been a servant
of Swainson, was employed in the preparation of the syrup but was
not acquainted with the complete preparation, certain essential ingredients
being introduced only by Swainson himself and only in the
presence of the plaintiff. Then it alleged “that the defendant being
discharged from his service had made and advertised for sale a spurious
preparation under the name of Velno’s Vegetable Syrup, stated
by him to be the same medicine in composition and quality as that
made by Swainson and the plaintiff, the defendant’s advertisement
certifying that the medicine prepared by him at his residence under
the name of Velno’s Vegetable Syrup is precisely the same with that
made and sold by the late Mr. Swainson.” It was alleged that that
was untrue, and that it was a spurious preparation pretending to be
the same when it really was not. To that bill the defendant put in a
general demurrer for want of equity. That demurrer was sustained
by the Vice-Chancellor, Sir Thomas Plumer, although for the purposes
of that demurrer it was taken that the defendant selling this
article was falsely stating that it was the same as the plaintiff’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, the learned counsel relied upon recent cases in which
an injunction has been granted to restrain the publication of a libel,
and he suggested that there had been a growth of equity jurisprudence
which had brought within its ambit a class of cases which were
previously not regarded as within it. But when the case in which the
Court of Appeal laid down that an injunction might be granted to
restrain the publication of a libel is looked at, it will be seen that the
decision was not founded upon any principle or rule of equity jurisprudence,
but upon the fact that a Court of Common Law could have
granted such an injunction in an action of libel, and that since the
Judicature Act the power which a Court of Common Law possessed
in that respect is now possessed also by the Court of Chancery. That
was distinctly the ground upon which the judgment was founded, that
“the 79th and 82d sections of the Common Law Procedure Act 1854
undoubtedly conferred on the Courts of Common Law the power, if a
fit case should arise, to grant injunctions at any stage of a cause in all
personal actions of contract or tort, with no limitation as to defamation;”
and then, inasmuch as those powers are now possessed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_825'>825</span>Chancery Division, it was held that they likewise could in such cases
grant an injunction. That was the decision in Bonnard <em>v.</em> Perryman,
[1891] 2 Ch. 269.</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, obviously to call for the exercise of that power it would
be necessary to show that there was an actionable wrong well laid,
and if the statement only showed a part of that which was necessary
to make up a cause of action—that is to say, if special damage was
necessary to the maintenance of the action, and that special damage
was not shown—a tort in the eye of the law would not be disclosed,
the case would not be within those provisions, and no injunction
would be granted. I think, therefore, for these reasons, that the
plaintiff would not be entitled to an injunction, any more than he
would be entitled to maintain an action unless he established all that
was necessary to make out that a tort had been committed; and for
the reasons which I have given, taking the Western Counties Manure
Company <em>v.</em> Lawes Chemical Manure Company, L. R. 9 Ex. 218, to
be good law, he has not brought himself within it.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, my Lords, I cannot help saying that I entertain very grave
doubts whether any action could be maintained for an alleged disparagement
of another’s goods, merely on the allegation that the goods
sold by the party who is alleged to have disparaged his competitor’s
goods are better either generally or in this or that particular respect
than his competitor’s are. Of course, I put aside the question (it is
not necessary to consider it) whether where a person intending to
injure another, and not in the exercise of his own trade and vaunting
his own goods, has maliciously and falsely disparaged the goods of
another, an action will lie; I am dealing with the class of cases which
is now before us, where the only disparagement consists in vaunting
the superiority of the defendant’s own goods. In Evans <em>v.</em> Harlow
Lord Denman expressed himself thus: “The gist of the complaint
is the defendant’s telling the world that the lubricators sold by the
plaintiff were not good for their purpose, but wasted the tallow. A
tradesman offering goods for sale exposes himself to observations of
this kind, and it is not by averring them to be ‘false, scandalous, malicious,
and defamatory’ that the plaintiff can found a charge of libel
upon them. To decide so would open a very wide door to litigation,
and might expose every man who said his goods were better than another’s
to the risk of an action.” My Lords, those observations seem
to me to be replete with good sense. It is to be observed that Evans
<em>v.</em> Harlow, 5 Q. B. 624, does not appear to have been decided on the
ground merely that there was no allegation of special damage. The
only judge who alludes to the absence of such an allegation is Patteson,
J. No reference to it is to be found either in the judgment of
Lord Denman or in the judgment of Wightman, J., the other two
judges who took part in that decision; and I think it is impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_826'>826</span>not to see that, as Lord Denman says, a very wide door indeed would
be opened to litigation, and that the courts might be constantly employed
in trying the relative merits of rival productions, if an action
of this kind were allowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Moulton sought to distinguish the present case by saying that
all that Lord Denman referred to was one tradesman saying that his
goods were better than his rival’s. That, he said, is a matter of opinion,
but whether they are more healthful and more nutritious is a
question of fact. My Lords, I do not think it is possible to draw
such a distinction. The allegation of a tradesman that his goods are
better than his neighbor’s very often involves only the consideration
whether they possess one or two qualities superior to the other. Of
course “better” means better as regards the purpose for which they
are intended, and the question of better or worse in many cases depends
simply upon one or two or three issues of fact. If an action
will not lie because a man says that his goods are better than his
neighbor’s, it seems to me impossible to say that it will lie because
he says that they are better in this or that or the other respect. Just
consider what a door would be opened if this were permitted. That
this sort of puffing advertisement is in use is notorious; and we see
rival cures advertised for particular ailments. The Court would then
be bound to inquire, in an action brought, whether this ointment or
this pill better cured the disease which it was alleged to cure—whether
a particular article of food was in this respect or that better
than another. Indeed, the courts of law would be turned into a
machinery for advertising rival productions by obtaining a judicial
determination which of the two was the better. As I said, advertisements
and announcements of that description have been common
enough; but the case of Evans <em>v.</em> Harlow, 5. Q. B. 624, was decided in
the year 1844, somewhat over half a century ago, and the fact that
no such action—unless it be Western Counties Manure Co. <em>v.</em> Lawes
Chemical Manure Co., L. R. 9 Ex. 218—has ever been maintained
in the Courts of Justice is very strong indeed to show that it is not
maintainable. It is, indeed, unnecessary to decide the point in order
to dispose of the present appeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the reasons which I have given I have come to the conclusion
that the judgment of the court below cannot be sustained, even assuming
the law to be as stated by the learned judges; but inasmuch
as the case is one of great importance, and some additional color
would be lent to the idea that an action of this description was maintainable
by the observations in the court below, I have thought it
only right to express my grave doubts whether any such action could
be maintained even if the facts brought the case within the law there
laid down.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the whole, therefore, I think that the judgment of Romer, J.,
was right and ought to be restored and that this appeal should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_827'>827</span>allowed, with the usual result as to costs; and I so move your Lordships.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Order of the Court of Appeal reversed; Judgment of Romer, J., restored,

<h4 class='c013'>STONE <em>v.</em> CARLAN<br /> <span class='sc'>Superior Court, New York, 1850.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 13 Law Reporter, 360.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>The important facts of this case appear in the opinion of the court.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Campbell, J.</span> A motion is made for an injunction restraining the
defendants from using the names “Irving Hotel,” “Irving House,”
“Irving,” &amp;c., upon their coaches and upon certain badges worn by
defendants upon their arms and hats. The complainants have an
agreement with the proprietors of the Irving House, in this city, under
which they are permitted to use the name of such proprietors, and the
name of their hotel, upon their coaches and the badges of their servants;
the complainants paying therefor a stipulated sum, and having
also entered into bonds for the faithful discharge of these duties. All
the porters are engaged in carrying passengers and their baggage to
and from the hotels, boats, railroad depots, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was well remarked by the Master of the Rolls, in Croft <em>v.</em> Day,
7 Bevan, 84, that “No man has a right to dress himself in colors, or
adopt and bear symbols, to which he has no peculiar or exclusive right,
and thereby personate another person, for the purpose of inducing the
public to suppose, either that he is that other person, or that he is
connected with and selling the manufacture of such other person, while
he is really selling his own. It is perfectly manifest that to do these
things is to commit a fraud, and a very gross fraud. I stated upon a
former occasion, that, in my opinion, the right which any person may
have to the protection of this court does not depend upon any exclusive
right which he may be supposed to have to a particular name, or
to a particular form of words. His right is to be protected against
fraud; and fraud may be practised against him by means of a name,
though the person practising it may have a perfect right to use that
name, provided he does not accompany the use of it with such other
circumstances as to effect a fraud upon others.” I entirely concur in
the foregoing views. The question is, whether the defendants have
committed a fraud. I cannot doubt that their intention was to mislead,
and to induce travellers to believe that they were servants of the
proprietors of the Irving House. This is a large and popular hotel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_828'>828</span>well known in the country, and many a traveller may wish to resort to
it on his arrival in this city, who, at the same time, may not know
whether the carriages of the proprietors are painted red or white, or
whether the exact designation is that of the Irving House or Irving
Hotel. Such traveller may wish to intrust himself and his baggage to
the servants of the hotel, feeling that, in doing so, he would be protected
against loss or damage by the responsibility of the proprietors.
Now, in this case, it can hardly be doubted but that the object of the
defendant was to induce the belief on the part of the travellers that
they were the servants of this hotel. To induce such belief, it was not
necessary that the resemblance of all carriages and badges should be
complete. From the very circumstances of the case, it would not be
necessary to have a perfect resemblance, in order to commit even a
gross fraud. It is not necessary to go, in this case, the length of the
ordinary cases of trade-marks, though this case might come within
the rules of those cases. (See Coates <em>v.</em> Holluck, 2 Sanford Ch. R.,
and Notes, and cases there cited.) The false pretences of the defendants
would, I think, necessarily tend to mislead. The defendants have
a perfect right to engage in a spirited competition in conveyance of
passengers and their baggage. They may employ better carriages than
the plaintiffs. They may carry for less fare. They may be more
active, energetic, and attentive. The employment is open to them,
but “they must not dress themselves in colors, and adopt and bear
symbols,” which belong to others. I had some doubt, at the time of
the argument, whether the complaint should not have been made by
the proprietors of the Irving House; but, on further reflection, think
that the suit is well brought. The plaintiffs are the real parties in
interest. It is possible that, owing to the general liability of the proprietors,
as innkeepers, for the loss of the property of guests, the proprietors
might also be entitled to an injunction restraining the
defendants from holding themselves out as the servants of the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>An injunction must issue, as prayed for, against all the defendants.<a id='r545'></a><a href='#f545' class='c015'><sup>[545]</sup></a></p>

  <h4 class='c013'>HUGHES <em>v.</em> McDONOUGH<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court of Judicature, New Jersey, November, 1881.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 43 New Jersey Law Reports, 459.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>On writ of error.</p>

<p class='c007'>The substance of the declaration was, that the plaintiff was a blacksmith
and horseshoer by trade, of good character, &amp;c.; that he had
obtained the patronage of one Peter Van Riper, and that on a certain
occasion he shod a certain mare of the said Van Riper in a good and
workmanlike manner; that the defendant, maliciously intending to injure
the plaintiff in his said trade, &amp;c., “did wilfully and maliciously
mutilate, impair and destroy the work done and performed by the
said plaintiff upon the mare of the said Van Riper, without the knowledge
of the said Van Riper, by loosing a shoe which was recently put
on by the said plaintiff, so that if the mare was driven, the shoe would
come off easily, and thus make it appear that the said plaintiff was an
unskilful and careless horseshoer and blacksmith, and that the said
mare was not shod in a good and workmanlike manner, and thus deprive
the said plaintiff of the patronage and custom of the said Van
Riper.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The second count charges the defendant with driving a nail in the
foot of the horse of Van Riper, after it had been shod by the plaintiff,
with the same design as specified in the first count.</p>

<p class='c007'>The special damage laid was the loss of Van Riper as a customer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Argued at June term, 1881, before Beasley, Chief Justice, and Justices
Scudder, Knapp and Reed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_830'>830</span>The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Beasley, C. J.</span> The single exception taken to this record is, that
the wrongful act alleged to have been done by the defendant does not
appear to have been so closely connected with the damages resulting
to the plaintiff as to constitute an actionable tort. The contention
was, that the wrong was done to Van Riper; that it was his horse
whose shoe was loosened, and whose foot was pricked, and that the
immediate injury and damage were to him, and that, consequently,
the damages of the plaintiff were too remote to be made the basis of a
legal claim.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this contention involves a misapplication of the legal principle,
and cannot be sustained. The illegal act of the defendant had a close
causal connection with the hurt done to the plaintiff, and such hurt
was the natural and almost direct product of such cause. Such harmful
result was sure to follow, in the usual course of things, from the
specified malfeasance. The defendant is conclusively chargeable with
the knowledge of this injurious effect of his conduct, for such effect
was almost certain to follow from such conduct, without the occurrence
of any extraordinary event, or the help of any extraneous cause.
The act had a twofold injurious aspect: it was calculated to injure
both Van Riper and the plaintiff; and as each was directly damnified,
I can perceive no reason why each could not repair his losses by an
action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts here involved do not, with respect to their legal significance,
resemble the juncture that gave rise to the doctrine established
in the case of Vicars <em>v.</em> Wilcocks, 8 East, 1. In that instance the
action was for a slander that required the existence of special damage
as one of its necessary constituents, and it was decided that such constituent
was not shown by proof of the fact that as a result of the
defamation the plaintiff had been discharged from his service by his
employer before the end of the term for which he had contracted.
The ground of this decision was that this discharge of the plaintiff
from his employment was illegal, and was the act of a third party, for
which the defendant was not responsible, and that, as the wrong of
the slander became detrimental only by reason of an independent
wrongful act of another, the injury was to be imputed to the last
wrong, and not to that which was farther distant one remove. In his
elucidation of the law in this case, Lord Ellenborough says, alluding
to the discharge of the plaintiff from his employment, that it “was a
mere wrongful act of the master, for which the defendant was no more
answerable, than if, in consequence of the words, other persons had
afterwards assembled and seized the plaintiff and thrown him into a
horse-pond by way of punishment for his supposed transgression.”
The class of cases to which this authority belongs, rests upon the principle
that a man is responsible only for the natural consequences of his
own misdeeds, and that he is not answerable for detriments that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_831'>831</span>ensue from the misdeeds of others. But this doctrine, it is to be remembered,
does not exclude responsibility when the damage results
to the party injured through the intervention of the legal and innocent
acts of third parties; for, in such instances, damage is regarded
as occasioned by the wrongful cause, and not at all by those which
are not wrongful. Where the effect was reasonably to have been foreseen,
and where, in the usual course of events, it was likely to follow
from the cause, the person putting such cause in motion will be responsible,
even though there may have been many concurring events
or agencies between such cause and its consequences. This principle
is stated, and is illustrated by a reference to a multitude of decisions
in Cooley on Torts, 70, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i>...<a id='r546'></a><a href='#f546' class='c015'><sup>[546]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The principles thus propounded must have a controlling effect in the
decision of the question now before this court, as they decisively show
that the damage of which the plaintiff complained was not, in a legal
sense, remote from the wrongful act. What, in point of substance,
was done by the defendant, was this: he defamed, by the medium of a
fraudulent device, the plaintiff in his trade, and by means of which
defamation, the latter sustained special detriment. If this defamation
had been accomplished by word spoken or written, or by signs or pictures,
it is plain the wrong could have been remedied, in the usual
form, by an action on the case for the slander; and, plainly, no reason
exists why the law should not afford a similar redress when the same
injury has been inflicted by disreputable craft. It is admitted upon
the record that the plaintiff has sustained a loss by the fraudulent
misconduct of the defendant; that such loss was not only likely, in the
natural order of events, to proceed from such misconduct, but that
it was the design of the defendant to produce such result by his act.
Under such circumstances it would be strange indeed if the party thus
wronged could not obtain indemnification by an appeal to the judicial
tribunals.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>HUGHES <em>v.</em> SAMUELS BROTHERS<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Iowa, October 17, 1916.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 179 Iowa Reports, 1077.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Gaynor, J.</span> Plaintiff and defendant both reside in the city of
Storm Lake, and each is and was engaged in the retail furniture
business, and, as an incident thereto, carried on a business of undertaking.
Defendants are a copartnership.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff claims: That on the 6th day of October, 1914, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_832'>832</span>defendants falsely and maliciously composed and published of and
concerning the plaintiff the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bear in mind our Undertaking Department. Satisfaction guaranteed.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(Signed) H. L. Hughes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That the defendants caused the same to be printed upon a card and
mailed to the address of one Albert Cattermole, a citizen and resident
of Storm Lake. That at the time the card was mailed the wife of
the said Cattermole was lying critically ill in a hospital in Storm
Lake. That of this fact the defendants had full knowledge at the
time they composed and published said statement. That they composed
and published it for the malicious purpose of injuring the
plaintiff in his reputation and business as aforesaid. That the same
as so published tended to provoke plaintiff to wrath, and expose him
to public hatred, contempt, and ridicule, and to deprive him of public
confidence and esteem and social intercourse. That the same was
further published for the malicious and wicked purpose of causing
the said Albert Cattermole and members of his family, and others to
whom the said card or letter might become known, to believe that
plaintiff sent the card, and for the further purpose of inducing the
said Cattermole to refrain from patronizing the business of the plaintiff.
That the publication was further made for the purpose of inciting
indignation and hatred in the minds of said Cattermole and the
members of his family towards the plaintiff and his business as an
undertaker, and that it did this. That similar cards were sent to
other persons under similar circumstances, and for the purposes
aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this petition defendants filed a demurrer, the substance of
which is, that the plaintiff’s petition stated no cause of action; that
the words published were not libellous <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, and no special damages
are alleged to have been suffered by the plaintiff on account of its
publication. This demurrer was sustained by the court. Plaintiff
elected to stand on his pleading and not to plead further, and his
petition was thereupon dismissed, and from the action of the court
in the premises plaintiff has appealed to this court....</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears that Cattermole’s wife was sick unto death at the time
this card was composed by defendants and sent to him. The defendants
knew this fact at the time they composed and mailed the card.
We take judicial notice of the fact that the city in which the parties
resided was not so populous that the active business men of the city
were not known to each other and to the general public. The card
was so framed and mailed by the defendants as to lead the receiver to
believe that the plaintiff had composed and mailed it, and this was
their purpose in mailing it. What possible reason could they have in
preparing and publishing this card? Was it to help a rival? Was
it to exploit the business of a rival? Was it intended as a letter of
credit to the public by and through which he would be better installed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_833'>833</span>in its confidence and esteem? Is this the usual and ordinary course
of procedure on the part of rival business firms? With the largest
charity, we cannot think this was the purpose of the publication.
What, then, was the purpose in the minds of these defendants when
they composed and sent these cards to the sick and dying in the community?
Was it not rather, as the petition says, to deprive him of
public confidence and esteem? Was it not rather to expose him to
public contempt and ridicule? Was it not rather to divert business
through this means from the plaintiff, and to injure him by such
diversion?</p>

<p class='c007'>Cattermole’s wife was sick unto death at the time he received this
card; confined in the hospital. What impression would this card
make upon his mind? Would it not bring before him the spectacle
of a vulture waiting to prey upon the dead? A man without sympathy
for the living because he found more revenue in the dead?
What is it these defendants meant by this thing that they have done?
What end had they in view? We think, surely, that which the petition
charges, to wit, to injure the plaintiff in his reputation and business,
to expose him to public contempt or ridicule, to deprive him
of public confidence and esteem. What, then, would be the natural
and ordinary effect of such a card upon the mind of one to whom it
was sent, under the conditions attending Cattermole? Surely it
would bring the sender of such a card, under the conditions then
existing, into contempt and hatred, and deprive him of public confidence
and esteem. Can the thought be entertained for a moment
that after the receipt of a card like this under those circumstances,
that the receiver would patronize the sender in the event the stricken
wife had died? Was it to secure this for the plaintiff that the card
was sent?</p>

<p class='c007'>Published words which directly tend to the prejudice or injury of a
person in his office, profession, or business are actionable. Williams
<em>v.</em> Davenport, 42 Minn. 393, 44 N. W. 311, 118 Am. St. Rep. 519.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any publication calculated to expose one to public hatred, contempt,
or ridicule is libellous <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. Dressel <em>v.</em> Shipman, 57 Minn.
23, 58 N. W. 684.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general rule is, that when language is published concerning a
person or his affairs, which, from its nature, necessarily must, or presumably
will as its natural and proximate consequence, occasion him
pecuniary loss, its publication is libellous <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. See Townsend on
Slander and Libel, (4th ed.) §§ 146 and 147; Fry <em>v.</em> McCord, 95
Tenn. 680, 33 S. W. 568.</p>

<p class='c007'>Peculiar damages are required to be alleged only when the publication,
with its attending facts and circumstances, is such that damages
do not naturally arise from the publication. If the publication, with
its attending facts and circumstances, is such that the court can
legally presume that injury followed as a natural and inevitable consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_834'>834</span>of the act complained of, then there is no occasion, in order
to maintain an action, that the plaintiff allege or prove peculiar damages.
If the nature and character of the publication, with its attending
facts and circumstances, are such as to injuriously affect or detract
from the reputation and standing of another, and as a natural and
proximate result, tend to bring him into public contempt, hatred, or
ridicule, then it is libellous <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. If such injury can be said to be a
natural proximate result or consequence of its publication, then the
plaintiff is presumed to have been damaged, and there is no need of
any allegation of peculiar damages. The extent of the damages is
for the jury.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the venom of poisoned speech that constitutes the libel. In
tracing the wrong that flows from the publication, we come first to the
mind of the reader, and inquire what effect it would naturally have
upon the ordinary thinking mind. We first consider the facts published,
and the circumstances under which they were published, and
the persons to whom a knowledge of the publication was brought. An
inquiry arises, would such a publication, under such circumstances,
naturally tend to poison the mind against the person concerning
whom the matter was published? If the matter published can be
said, in its natural effect upon the mind, to produce hurt to the good
name, fame, and reputation of the person about whom the publication
is made, then we say the matter is defamatory, and the person
necessarily has suffered not only wrong, but damages, as a proximate
result of the wrong—damage to his good name, fame, and reputation
in the community. If the words in and of themselves, when
published, do not tend to this effect naturally and of their own force
and vitality, the mind naturally inquires into the circumstances under
which they were published, the manner of their publication, and the
persons to whom a knowledge of the publication was brought. This
inquiry is pursued to ascertain the effect which the publication, under
the circumstances, would naturally have upon the mind of the person
to whom a knowledge of the publication was brought. If the words
and the circumstances attending their publication would not naturally
affect the mind prejudicially against the person concerning whom the
publication is made, it must be alleged and shown, not only that they
were used in a defamatory sense, but that they were so understood by
the hearers. When words, innocent in themselves, are charged to have
been intended and used in a defamatory sense, it must be alleged and
proven that they were intended in a defamatory sense and were so
understood by the persons to whom they were addressed. If they do
not themselves convey a defamatory meaning, or an imputation that
is defamatory, something must be alleged which shows, or tends to
show, that the user of the words intended them in a defamatory sense,
and that the persons to whom a knowledge of the publication came
were affected in their mental attitude towards the person, to the injury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_835'>835</span>of his good name, fame, and reputation. The publication may
be so worded that this could not be gathered from the publication
itself. It may be innocent and even commendatory in itself, yet the
facts and circumstances attending the publication, the relationship
of the parties—the defamer and the defamed—to the public may
be such, considered in the light of the subject-matter concerning
which the publication is made, that it is apparent that there was not
only an intent to defame, but that a defamatory imputation was so
exposed, that the ordinary mind easily grasped the purpose of the
publication and its injurious consequences to the good name, fame,
and reputation of the defamed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Men receive impressions of and concerning others from what they
hear others say about them. Libel is a tort. It consists in a wrong
done to the good name, fame, and reputation of another. It is in
the nature of an assault upon the good name, fame, and reputation of
another. The law protects a man in the possession of his good name,
and denies to others the right, wrongfully and wickedly, to make an
assault upon it. It is often the only asset a man has. Rob him of
this, and you rob him of all that he has in life that makes life worth
living.</p>

<p class='c007'>A physical assault is clearly understood and easily defined. One
may be punished criminally or mulcted in damages civilly for physical
assault. Libel is an assault upon that invisible and intangible thing
known as reputation. Though invisible and intangible, it exists
among men and is prized, and the law protects it. As has been said
by this court, libel rests upon the thought that a public wrong has
been committed; an act has been done in violation of the statute, to
the hurt of the complaining citizen. A citizen’s right to remain secure
in his good name and reputation among his fellows, and to enjoy their
confidence and esteem, has been violated. A libel is that which tends
to take from him one of his most valuable rights—his right to the
confidence, esteem, and respect of his fellow men. One who, by right
living and right conduct, has built up for himself an enviable name
among his fellows, and has drawn to him their confidence and esteem,
is entitled to retain and enjoy the same, and one who wrongfully and
maliciously, and without just cause, makes an assault thereon, and
impairs or injures the same, does a grievous wrong for which he is
answerable in damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that the wrong must be found in the publication, not
merely in the wording of the thing published. The injury must flow
from the publication. The damage must be the natural and proximate
result of the publication; a result that usually, naturally, and
ordinarily follows as a result of the wrong done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though the article itself conveys no wrong impression concerning
the complainant, and in and of itself could do no harm, it may become
most injurious, most hurtful; it may become a direct assault upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_836'>836</span>the good name, fame, and reputation, because of the manner and the
circumstances under which it was published. The publication must be
libellous, not necessarily that the article in and of itself is libellous.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A libel is the malicious defamation of a person made public by
any writing,” &amp;c. It is the malicious defamation against which the
inhibition of the statute is raised; malicious defamation made public
by writing. A writing made public which is intended to and does,
because of its publication, tend to provoke to wrath, to expose to public
hatred, contempt, or ridicule, or which deprives one of the benefits
of public confidence and social intercourse, is libellous <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every written publication, maliciously made, defamatory of another,
which tends to any of the consequences set out in the statute, is
a violation of the inhibitions of the statute. It is therefore a wrong
done to a citizen in violation of the statute. It is therefore actionable
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. The fact that it is a violation of the inhibition of the statute
makes it actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In contemplation of law, reputation is a delicate plant, withered
by the breath of scandal. Any publication which imputes to another
conduct which right-thinking men condemn, whether the conduct involve
a crime, moral turpitude, or any conduct in life, purpose, or
manner of living which the common sense of right-thinking men condemns,
is presumed in law to have injuriously affected the reputation
of the person so assailed, and, by such injury, to have caused him some
damage.</p>

<p class='c007'>It follows, therefore, that libel is an assault upon character resulting
in some injury to reputation. The injury must be traceable to
the assault, and the damage must be the proximate result of the injury.
Every one recognizes the blighting effect of scandalous utterances
directed against the character, conduct, or reputation of men.
Every one recognizes that such assaults, publicly made, tend injuriously
to affect the reputation and standing of the one so assailed
among his fellows. It is from the recognition of this that the law
implies damages, without allegation or proof of special damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defamation consists in maliciously poisoning the minds of others
against the party assaulted by printing, writing, &amp;c., thereby bringing
on them some of the consequences provided against in the statute.
The statute is intended to, and does, prohibit the malicious poisoning
of the minds of others against a citizen, under the protection of the
law, by the use of public printing, &amp;c., and this inhibition attaches
whether done directly by the wording of the thing complained of, or
indirectly by insinuation, imputation, or suggestion. The statute is
intended to protect one in a right, and to deny to others the liberty to
invade that right.</p>

<p class='c007'>With no explanation from the defendants, we may rightly assume
that they prepared and mailed this card for the purpose hereinbefore
indicated, and that the consequences charged in the petition were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_837'>837</span>consequences that naturally flowed from the thing done. We think
the pleading was sufficient to present the question to the jury. As
supporting what we have said, see Call <em>v.</em> Larabee, 60 Iowa, 212, 14
N. W. 237; Hollenbeck <em>v.</em> Ristine, 105 Iowa, 488, 75 N. W. 355, 67
Am. St. Rep. 306; Halley <em>v.</em> Gregg, 74 Iowa, 564, 38 N. W. 416.
In the latter case it is said, in substance, that if the act charged constitutes
a libel, as defined by the statute, it is actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. See
Zier <em>v.</em> Hofflin, 33 Minn. 66, 21 N. W. 862, 53 Am. Rep. 9, in which
it is said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Words which may be innocent of themselves may be rendered
libellous by the place and circumstances of their publication, for such
place and circumstances may impress on them a meaning and suggestion
which, standing alone, they do not have. Thus, though the
words here do not of themselves impute wrong, they might be published
in such a place or under such circumstances as to make them
capable of naturally conveying the impression that plaintiff had been
guilty of dishonest practices, either in contracting the debt or in withholding
payment of it.... What meaning they would naturally
convey was for the jury to determine in view of the circumstances of
their publication.” State of Missouri <em>v.</em> Armstrong, 106 Mo. 395, 16
S. W. 604, reported in 13 L. R. A. 419, 27 Am. St. Rep. 361, together

<p class='c007'>We find no case directly in point on the questions here considered.
We think, however, the plaintiff presented a fair question for the
jury, and the court erred in sustaining the demurrer, and the cause
is therefore reversed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Nortoni, J.</span> This is a suit for damages, in which plaintiff recovered
a verdict for one dollar. On this verdict, judgment was given,
and defendant prosecutes an appeal therefrom.</p>

<p class='c007'>All of the relevant facts appear from the face of the petition, and
the question of liability is to be determined thereon. It appears
that the plaintiff, the defendant and the D’Arcy Advertising Company
are each corporations engaged in their respective callings in the
city of St. Louis. Plaintiff owns and is engaged in the business of
operating a steam laundry. Defendant is engaged in the business of
manufacturing envelopes. The D’Arcy Advertising Company is engaged
in the advertising business—that is to say, it places advertisement
in St. Louis for those who choose to patronize it. The
plaintiff laundry company engaged the D’Arcy Advertising Company
to do certain advertising for it by running what is known as a “blind”
advertisement. Such “blind” advertisement is described in the petition
as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fundamental idea of same (the ‘blind’ advertisement) being
the use of some striking device well adapted to attract public attention,
but unaccompanied, upon its first appearance, by the name of
the advertiser using it, other matter being added later and the name
of the advertiser, also, being given when the curiosity of the public
has been sufficiently piqued and the attention of the public has been
excited by the ‘blind’ nature of the advertisement.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The striking device referred to in the quotation from the petition
and that contemplated in the instant case is the word “Stopurkicken.”
The petition avers that plaintiff entered into a contract with
the D’Arcy Advertising Company whereby it was to have the exclusive
use of the word “Stopurkicken;” that the D’Arcy Advertising
Company, in pursuance of plaintiff’s plan, had the word “Stopurkicken”
published upon signboards and by way of printed cards.
After the word “Stopurkicken” had been so used and before plaintiff
had time to determine upon a proper supplement to such advertisement
to disclose its own name and identity, the defendant, Hesse
Envelope Company, well knowing the word “Stopurkicken” was
being used in the manner mentioned and desiring to take advantage
of the word “Stopurkicken,” as above described, printed and distributed
throughout the city of St. Louis a large number of cards
bearing the word “Stopurkicken” and followed by the name of the
Hesse Envelope Company. Because of this use of the word by defendant,
Hesse Envelope Company, plaintiff avers it is damaged and
prays a recovery therefor.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_839'>839</span>It is said the word “Stopurkicken” is an attractive misspelling
and contraction of the phrase “Stop your kicking,” designed to excite
public curiosity. It is obvious the petition states no cause of action
against defendant unless the word “Stopurkicken” is either a trade-mark
in which plaintiff enjoys a proprietary right, or is possessed of
a secondary meaning, which, by user, has become a part of the good
will of plaintiff’s business, otherwise the word is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">publici juris</span></i> and
available to every person desiring to employ it identically as is the
original phrase of which it is a contraction. From the affirmative
averments of the petition, it is entirely clear plaintiff enjoyed no
trade-mark in the word under consideration. Indeed, the cause does
not proceed upon that theory. Plaintiff is engaged in the laundry
business, which, of course, is that of washing and ironing for others.
There is no suggestion in the petition that the word “Stopurkicken”
was in any manner annexed to plaintiff’s wares or the output of its
laundry. Infringement of a trade-mark consists in the unauthorized
use or colorable imitation of it upon substituted goods of the same
class as those for which the mark has been appropriated. (38 Cyc.
741.) The petition reveals that plaintiff has not yet employed the
word in any manner so as to identify it with its business, for it says,
though a contract had been entered into between plaintiff and the
D’Arcy Advertising Company for the use of the word and it had
been employed in blank space on signboards and on cards, plaintiff
had not yet revealed its identity in connection therewith. Defendant
is engaged in the manufacture and sale of envelopes and used the
word on an advertising card followed immediately by the name Hesse
Envelope Company. These facts appearing as they do in the petition,
sufficiently disclose that no proprietary right as in trade-mark existed
in the plaintiff in respect of the word “Stopurkicken.” Not only
must an exclusive proprietary right appear in the trade-mark but the
actual use of the trade-mark is essential as a means of identifying the
origin, ownership or manufacture of the goods of its proprietor, and,
furthermore, such trade-mark must be annexed to and accompany
the goods into the market to the end of their identification. (See
Grocers Journal Co. <em>v.</em> Midland Publishing Co., 127 Mo. App. 356,
366, 105 S. W. 310; 38 Cyc. 691, 693.) Unless the word or insignia
relied upon is in some manner attached or affixed to the article in
trade or stamped or inscribed thereon, it is not a trade-mark and
the maker of such article is without trade-mark rights concerning it.
(See Oakes <em>v.</em> St. Louis Candy Co., 146 Mo. 391, 48 S. W. 467; St.
Louis Piano Mfg. Co. <em>v.</em> Merkel, 1 Mo. App. 305.) It is entirely
clear that defendant in using the word “Stopurkicken” in connection
with advertising its envelopes, was not infringing upon plaintiff’s
laundry business, for the wares or commodities of the two companies
are entirely dissimilar. But aside from this, it appears affirmatively
that the plaintiff had never used the word in connection with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_840'>840</span>output of its laundry. It had, therefore, obtained no proprietary
right thereto by continued use through affixing it to the workmanship
of its laundry turned out into the market.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the same reasons, in part at least, no secondary right to the use
of the phrase appears in plaintiff by user such as is essential to render
it a portion of the good will of its laundry business as if reputation obtained
thereon. It is certain that the case may not be sustained as
one for unfair competition. Unfair competition consists in passing
off or attempting to pass off upon the public the goods or business of
one person as and for the goods or business of another. (See Cyc.
756.) Nothing less than conduct tending to pass off one man’s goods
or business as that of another will constitute unfair competition, for
such is the very essence of the wrong on which the law affords redress
to the injured party. (See Elgin National Watch Co. <em>v.</em> Illinois
Watch Co., 179 U. S. 665, 674, 21 S. Ct. 270, 45 L. Ed. 365; 38 Cyc.
762, 763; 38 Cyc. 758; see, also, Grocers Journal Co. <em>v.</em> Midland
Pub. Co., 127 Mo. App. 356, 367, 105 S. W. 310.) The relief, in
cases of unfair competition, proceeds upon the theory that the words
or phrase employed as by long use in connection with the goods or
business of a particular trade come to be understood by the public as
designating the goods or business of that particular trader. Because
of such user, the word or phrase becomes identified with the business
of him who employs it and constitutes a part of its good will. Such
meaning of the words or phrase, it is said, is the genesis of the law
of unfair competition as distinguished from technical trade-mark,
and, therefore, relief against unfair competition is afforded upon the
ground that one who has built up a good will and reputation for his
goods or business under a particular designation is entitled to the
benefits therefrom. And secondary to this, the theory is that the
deception of the public injures the proprietor of the business by diverting
his customers and filching his trade. (Grocers Journal Co. <em>v.</em>
Midland Pub. Co., 127 Mo. App. 356, 367, 105 S. W. 310; 38 Cyc.
760, 761, 763, 769.)</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be observed that, though the right to complain as for unfair
competition does not in every instance require that the complainant
shall have a proprietary right in the phrase, it does require that he
shall have used it in his business as a means of identifying his goods
as his product and for a sufficient length of time to establish a repute
therefor in the market as pointing his product. (Grocers Journal Co.
<em>v.</em> Midland Pub. Co., 127 Mo. App. 356, 367, 105 S. W. 310; Reach
Co. <em>v.</em> Simmons Hardware Co., 155 Mo. App. 412, 135 S. W. 503;
38 Cyc. 769, 763.) Unless the word or phrase involved has become a
parcel of the good will of his business by continued use<a id='t840'></a> in connection
with the product of the proprietor, it is entirely clear that the use of
the same word by another does not reveal an unfair competition.
(Shelley <em>v.</em> Sperry, 121 Mo. App. 429, 99 S. W. 488.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_841'>841</span>The petition shows on its face that plaintiff had never used the
word “Stopurkicken” in connection with the output of its laundry,
but on the contrary only employed it on billboards and cards otherwise
blank, as an attraction to arouse the curiosity of the public with
a view of revealing the name of the advertiser (plaintiff) thereafter.
It is clear enough that, though defendant interposed and used the
same word on cards bearing its name, as it did, no unfair competition
appears when considered in the sense of the law on the subject and
until plaintiff had obtained a right thereto by actual user in connection
with the product of its laundry, the phrase “Stopurkicken”
must be regarded as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">publici juris</span></i> and available to all who desired to
employ it identically as was the original phrase “Stop your kicking.”
It is certain the D’Arcy Advertising Company had no superior right
to either the phrase or the contracted word and that it could confer
none upon plaintiff by its contract to employ it as a means of arousing
the curiosity of the public for plaintiff’s benefit. (Reach <em>v.</em> Simmons
Hardware Co., 155 Mo. App. 412, 135 S. W. 503.) Though persons
who have acquired a right in respect of words and phrases by user as
above indicated, may assign or contract such right to another in
conjunction with the good will of the commodity, the identity of
which they point, it is obvious that an advertising agent may not
appropriate any word or phrase he chooses by merely seizing it out
of our vocabulary, and confer an exclusive right thereto on another by
a contract to employ it in aid of his business. We are advised of no
principle of our jurisprudence on which the judgment in this case
may be sustained, and the counsel for plaintiff have omitted to file a
brief suggesting one. The judgment should be reversed. It is so
ordered. Reynolds, P. J., and Allen, J., concur.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE MIDLAND INSURANCE CO. <em>v.</em> SMITH<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Queen’s Bench Division, March 23, 1881.</span><br /> <em>Reported in Law Reports, 6 Queen’s Bench Division, 561.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Watkin Williams, J.</span><a id='r548'></a><a href='#f548' class='c015'><sup>[548]</sup></a> This action is one of an extraordinary,
and so far as I am aware of an unprecedented, character. The
questions of law involved in the case, which was argued before me
yesterday, arise upon demurrer to the statement of claim, and I now
proceed to give judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts, which for the purposes of the argument are assumed to
be true, are as follows: The plaintiffs, an insurance company, granted
to the defendant, Charles Smith, a policy of fire insurance, dated the
26th of June, 1880, by which they agreed with him that if certain
property in a certain house should be destroyed or damaged by fire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_842'>842</span>they would pay or make good all such loss or damage during the
currency of the policy. The defendant Mary, the wife of the defendant
Charles Smith, having been left by him in charge of the house
and property insured did, with the malicious intention of destroying
the insured property and of injuring the insurance company and of
creating a claim upon the policy, wilfully set fire to and destroy the
house and the insured property. Charles Smith, the assured, then
made a claim upon the policy against the company. The company
thereupon brought this present action against Smith and his wife, to
recover damages for the loss which the company alleged they had
sustained or might sustain through the wrongful and felonious act
of the defendant Mary, if the defendant Charles made good his claim
upon his policy.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was informed in the course of the argument, although these facts
do not appear formally before me, that the defendant Charles had,
before this present action, brought an action against the company
upon the policy to recover the amount of his loss, and that in that
action the company disputed their liability on the ground that the
loss, having been caused by the arson of the wife, was not covered by
the policy, and that they had also set up a counterclaim for damages
against Smith and his wife, who was brought in as a party to the
action upon the same ground; that that action went down to trial,
and that the learned judge, before whom the cause came on for trial,
adjourned the proceedings in order to enable the company to test the
validity in law of their contention in a separate and distinct manner
before proceeding to try the question of arson. The present action
was then commenced. The questions, however, for determination in
this action must depend exclusively upon the facts set forth in the
statement of claim, and the issues of law raised by the demurrer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The company in support of their case started with the general principle
that “every husband is liable for the wrongful acts of his wife,”
and that as the defendant Mary had wrongfully injured and destroyed
the insured property, and had caused the damage upon which a claim
upon the policy had been based, they, as the insurers of the property,
had a right to sue her and her husband for the damage and injury so
done by her, and not the less so because the husband happened to be
himself the assured whom they had agreed to indemnify. In substance,
the contention of the company came to this, that they ought
not to be called upon to pay the assured the amount claimed, without
being entitled concurrently to claim damages from him for the loss
caused by the act of his wife, for which he is answerable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants, by their demurrer to this claim, raised two main
issues of law. In the first place they said that the company were not
in a position to maintain any action for the alleged damage done to
the goods, because they were not the owners of the goods, nor had they
sufficient interest therein to entitle them to maintain an action; that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_843'>843</span>their only right as insurers would be to avail themselves of such rights
and remedies as were vested in their assured, after they had admitted
his claim and been subrogated to his rights in relation to the subject
of insurance; and that, even if they had been subrogated to the rights
of the assured, they could only sue in his name and could not maintain
an action in their own name, and therefore that no such action could
be maintained in the present case, because the assured had no right of
action against his own wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the next place the defendants contended that this action being
based upon an act, which on the face of the statement of claim
amounted to a felony, could not be maintained, because it was not
shown that the rights of the public law had been vindicated by a
prosecution of the felon.<a id='r549'></a><a href='#f549' class='c015'><sup>[549]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the first ground of demurrer the defendants are, in my judgment,
clearly entitled to judgment both upon principle and upon
authority. It appears to me that the insurance company have no right
of action under the circumstances for the damage done to the goods by
the defendant Mary. At the time when the damage was done to the
goods the company had no property or interest in the goods sufficient
to sustain any action for damage done to them; no right or interest
in the goods could accrue to the insurance company, until they had
acknowledged the claim under the policy, and by so doing entitled
themselves to the benefit of any claims and causes of action vested in
the assured; but it seems that even up to this moment the insurance
company dispute the claim and deny the right of the assured to demand
an indemnity under the policy. But, further, it seems to me
equally clear that, if they had done everything to entitle themselves
to the benefit of such a claim, it could only be enforced in the name
of the assured and for the purpose of enforcing his rights, and inasmuch
as he could have no such claim or right against his wife, it
follows that in no possible view of the case is the plaintiffs’ claim sustainable.
The case of Simpson <em>v.</em> Burrell, 3 App. Cas. 279, is in
point upon this question. In that case Burrell was the owner of two
ships, one of which negligently ran down and sank the other with a
valuable cargo. Burrell’s underwriters upon the sunken ship paid
him for a total loss, and were so subrogated to all his rights. A claim
was made by the owners of the cargo in the sunken ship against
Burrell, as the owner of the ship in fault, for the value of their goods,
and Burrell, as the owner of the ship in fault, paid into court the
whole value of that ship at £8 per ton, as the limit of his liability
under the Merchant Shipping Acts, to be ratably divided among all
who had sustained loss and damage by the ship being negligently run
down and sunk; thereupon Burrell’s underwriters upon the sunken
ship who had paid for a total loss claimed to come in and share with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_844'>844</span>the rest the money paid in by the ship in fault; but the House of
Lords, reversing the decision of the Lords of Session in Scotland,
decided that they had no such right, and the reasoning in that case
is directly applicable to the present. The Lord Chancellor Cairns
said, “The view of the Lord President therefore appears to be that,
after payment by the underwriters as on a total loss, there is effected
by some independent operation of law a transfer of whatever, if anything,
can be recovered in specie of the thing insured—and by reason
of the transfer of the thing insured an independent right in the underwriters
to maintain in their own name, and without reference to the
person assured, an action for the damage to the thing insured which
was the cause of the loss. I am not aware of any authority for the
view of the case thus taken. I know of no foundation for the right of
the underwriters, except the well-known principle of law that where
one person has agreed to indemnify another he will, on making good
the indemnity, be entitled to succeed to all the ways and means by
which the person indemnified might have protected himself against or
reimbursed himself for the loss.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Penzance said: “The learned counsel for the underwriters
contended that they, by virtue of the policy which they entered into
in respect of this ship, had an interest of their own in her welfare and
protection, inasmuch as any injury or loss sustained by her would
indirectly fall upon them as a consequence of their contract, and that
this interest was such as would support an action by them in their own
names and behalf against a wrong-doer. This proposition virtually
affirms a principle which I think your Lordships will do well to
consider with some care, as it will be found to have a much wider
application and signification than any which may be involved in the
incidents of a contract of insurance. The principle involved seems to
me to be this,—that where damage is done by a wrong-doer to a
chattel, not only the owner of the chattel, but all those who by contract
with the owner have bound themselves to obligations which are
rendered more onerous, or have secured to themselves advantages
which are rendered less beneficial by the damage done to the chattel,
have a right of action against the wrong-doer, although they have no
immediate or reversionary property in the chattel, and no possessory
right by reason of any contract attaching to the chattel itself, such as
by lien or hypothecation. This, I say, is the principle involved in the
respondent’s contention. If it be a sound one, it would seem to follow
that if by the negligence of a wrong-doer goods are destroyed, which
the owner of them had bound himself by contract to supply to a third
person, this person, as well as the owner, has a right of action for any
loss inflicted upon him by their destruction. But if this be true as to
injuries done to chattels, it would seem to be equally so as to injuries
to the person. An individual injured by a negligently driven carriage
has an action against the owner of it. Would a doctor, it may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_845'>845</span>asked, who had contracted to attend him and provide medicines for a
fixed sum by the year, also have a right of action in respect of the
additional cost of the attendance and medicine cast upon him by the
accident? And yet it cannot be denied that the doctor had an interest
in his patients safety. In like manner an actor or singer, bound for
a term to a manager of a theatre, is disabled by the wrongful act of a
third person to the serious loss of the manager; can the manager recover
damages for that loss from the wrong-doer? Such instances
might be indefinitely multiplied, giving rise to rights of action which
in modern communities, where every complexity of mutual relations
is daily created by contract, might be both numerous and novel.” See,
also, the cases of Randal <em>v.</em> Cockran, 1 Ves. Sen. 97; North of England
Insurance Association <em>v.</em> Armstrong, Law Rep. 5 Q. B. 244;
Stewart <em>v.</em> Greenock Marine Insurance Co., 2 H. L. C. 159; Davidson
<em>v.</em> Case, 8 Price, 542; Mason <em>v.</em> Sainsbury, 3 Douglas, 61; Yates <em>v.</em>
Whyte, 4 Bing. N. C. 272.</p>

<p class='c007'>This action cannot therefore in my judgment be maintained, nor is
there any substantial injustice in such a result, because, as it seems to
me, the insurance company are in this dilemma; the loss and damage
caused by the wrongful act of the wife either is or is not a loss which
the company have agreed to indemnify the husband against; now, if
it is such a loss, an attempt by the company to enforce against the husband
a return indemnity or reimbursement is at variance with the
very substance of their undertaking to indemnify him; if, on the
other hand, the loss, by reason of its having arisen from the act of the
wife, is not within the risks and losses covered by the policy, then this
action is as wholly misconceived, unnecessary, and unfounded, as if
the loss had been caused by any other risk not covered by the policy.
The truth is that the real and substantial contention on the part of
the insurance company is, that the loss in question having been caused
by the wilful act of the wife of the assured, although acting without
the privity of her husband, is not a loss covered or insured against by
the policy. That question might be raised in the action brought by
the assured against the company upon the policy, but it does not
arise, and indeed could not be raised, so as to receive a binding and
judicial determination, in such an action as the present. As however
the question has been fully and ably argued before me, and as the
parties have expressed a desire to elicit an opinion upon the point, I
have no hesitation in saying that it appears to me to be upon principle
perfectly clear and free from doubt that such a loss would be covered
by an ordinary policy against loss caused by fire; under such a policy
the company would be liable for every loss caused by fire, unless the
fire itself were caused and procured by the wilful act of the assured
himself or some one acting with his privity and consent. In order to
escape from responsibility for such a loss as the present the company
ought to introduce into their policy an express exception.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Durfee, C. J.</span><a id='r550'></a><a href='#f550' class='c015'><sup>[550]</sup></a> This is an action on the case for conspiracy. The
declaration charges in effect that the defendants and one Patrick Kenney,
said Kenney being then a debtor of the plaintiffs, conspired
together to prevent the plaintiffs and the other creditors of said Kenney
from getting payment of their claims out of his property, and
that, in pursuance of the conspiracy, Kenney made fictitious mortgages
of his real and personal property to the defendants, under cover
of which the defendants removed the personal property out of the
possession of Kenney, and secreted it so that the plaintiffs were prevented
from attaching it, and thus lost their claims. At the trial,
after the plaintiffs had introduced their testimony in proof of the
declaration, the court, on motion of the defendants, it having appeared
that the plaintiffs were merely creditors at large of Kenney, without
any interest in his property or lien upon it by attachment, levy, or
otherwise, ruled that the action, in respect of the charges aforesaid,
was not maintainable. The plaintiffs excepted to the ruling for error,
and now petition for a new trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is some conflict of authority on the question thus raised, but
the more numerous and, we think, the better-reasoned and stronger
cases are against the action. The principal ground of decision in these
cases is that the damage, which is the gist of the action, is too remote,
uncertain, and contingent, inasmuch as the creditor has, not an assured
right, but simply a <em>chance</em> of securing his claim by attachment
or levy, which he may or may not succeed in improving.<a id='r551'></a><a href='#f551' class='c015'><sup>[551]</sup></a> It is impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_847'>847</span>to find any measure of damages for the loss of such a mere
chance or possibility. Another ground, added in some of the cases,
is that no action would lie in favor of such a creditor against the
debtor for putting his property beyond the reach of legal process, if
the debtor were to do it by himself alone, and that what would not be
actionable if done by himself alone cannot be actionable any the more
when done by him with the assistance of others. The first of these
grounds, which is the fundamental one and has been chiefly relied
on, has been so exhaustively analyzed and discussed in the cases that
it is impossible for us to add anything to the reasons adduced in support
of it; and therefore, without reproducing them, we deem it sufficient
simply to cite the cases themselves, all of which are accessible
and can be readily consulted. Lamb <em>v.</em> Stone, 11 Pick. 527; Wellington

<h4 class='c013'>HUTCHINS <em>v.</em> HUTCHINS<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, New York, January, 1845.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 7 Hill, 104.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'><em>By the Court</em>, <span class='sc'>Nelson, C. J.</span><a id='r553'></a><a href='#f553' class='c015'><sup>[553]</sup></a> The case is substantially this:—The
father of the plaintiff devised to him, in due form of law, a farm
consisting of one hundred and fifty-one acres of land. The defendant,
being aware of the fact, and intending to deprive the plaintiff of the
benefit and advantage of the devise, and of his expected estate and
interest in the farm, falsely and maliciously represented to the father,
that, after his decease, the plaintiff intended to set up a large demand
against the estate, which would absorb the greater part of it, and thus
deprive the other children of their just share; at the same time defaming
and calumniating the character of the plaintiff in several particulars.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_848'>848</span>By these fraudulent means the defendant prevailed upon
the father to revoke and cancel the will, and to make and execute a
new one, by which the plaintiff was excluded from all participation in
his father’s estate.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the substance of the case, in its strongest aspect, as presented
by the pleadings; and the question arises whether any actual damage,
in contemplation of law, is shown to have been sustained by the
plaintiff?</p>

<p class='c007'>Fraud without damage, or damage without fraud, gives no cause of
action; but where both concur, an action lies. Damage, in the sense
of the law, may arise out of injuries to the person or to the property
of the party; as any wrongful invasion of either is a violation of his
legal rights, which it is the object of the law to protect. Thus, for
injuries to his health, liberty and reputation, or to his rights of property,
personal or real, the law has furnished the appropriate remedies.
The former are violations of the absolute rights of the person, from
which damage results as a legal consequence. As to the latter, the
party aggrieved must not only establish that the alleged tort or trespass
has been committed, but must aver and prove his right or interest
in the property or thing affected, before he can be deemed to
have sustained damages for which an action will lie.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, testing the plaintiff’s declaration by these principles, has he
made out a case from which it can be said that damage has resulted to
him? I think not. In respect to the farm devised to him by the first
will, he fails to show that he had any such interest in it as the law will
recognize. The only foundation of his claim rests upon the mere
unexecuted intention of his father to make a gift of the property; and
this cannot be said to have conferred a right of any kind. To hold
otherwise, and sanction the doctrine contended for by the plaintiff,
would be next to saying that every voluntary courtesy was matter of
legal obligation; that private thoughts and intentions, concerning
benevolent or charitable distributions of property, might be seized
upon as the foundation of a right which the law would deal with and
protect.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have not overlooked the cases referred to on the argument, of
actions of slander, where special damage must be shown in order to
make the words actionable; and where the deprivation of any present
substantial advantage, even though gratuitous, such as the loss of customers,
of a permanent home at a friend’s, or advancement in life, and
such like, if the immediate and direct consequence of the words, will
sustain the action. 1 Starkie on Slander, 158 to 186, Ed. of 1843.
If this description of special damage is to be regarded as the gist and
foundation of the action, I rather think the principle should be regarded
as peculiar to that species of injury. I am not aware of any
class of remedies given for a violation of the rights of property, where
so remote and contingent a damage has been allowed as a substantial
ground of action.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_849'>849</span>But the law applicable to the cases referred to proceeds upon the
ground that the plaintiff, by the wrongful act complained of, has been
deprived of the present, actual enjoyment of some pecuniary advantage.
No such damage can be pretended here. At best, the contemplated
gift was not to be realized till after the death of the testator,
which might not happen until after the death of the plaintiff; or the
testator might change his mind, or lose his property.</p>

<p class='c007'>In short, the plaintiff had no interest in the property of which he
says he has been deprived by the fraudulent interference of the defendant,
beyond a mere naked possibility; an interest which might indeed
influence his hopes and expectations, but which is altogether too
shadowy and evanescent to be dealt with by courts of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am of opinion that the defendant is entitled to judgment.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>LEWIS <em>v.</em> CORBIN<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, May 15, 1907.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 195 Massachusetts Reports, 520.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Action of tort. Demurrer to declaration.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Knowlton, C. J.</span><a id='r555'></a><a href='#f555' class='c015'><sup>[555]</sup></a> This is an action of tort in which the defendant
is charged with having deprived the plaintiff of a legacy, through his
fraud in inducing a testatrix to execute the codicil by which the legacy
purported to be given with only one witness, whereby the codicil was
rendered invalid. The legatee named in the codicil was the plaintiff’s
father, who had deceased before the codicil was made, although neither
the testatrix nor the defendant then knew of his death.</p>

<p class='c007'>One question is whether this legacy, which would be void at common
law (see Maybank <em>v.</em> Brooks, 1 Brown Ch. 76; Dildine <em>v.</em> Dildine,
32 N. J. Eq. 78, 80; Moss <em>v.</em> Helsley, 60 Tex. 426, 436), is
within the R. L. chap. 135, sec. 21, which provides that when a devise
or legacy is made to a child or other relation of the testator who dies
before the testator, leaving issue surviving the testator, such issue
shall take the gift unless the will requires a different disposition of it.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>We are of opinion that the purpose of the Legislature is best accomplished
by holding the statute applicable to devises and legacies given
to relations who died before the making of the will, as well as legacies
and devises to those who died after the making of the will.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The defendant contends that the plaintiff’s declaration fails to aver
damage suffered by him on account of the defendant’s misconduct.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_850'>850</span>It is true, as he argues, that in order to create a liability of this kind,
there must be, not only a wrong inflicted by the defendant, but damage
to the plaintiff resulting directly therefrom. Lamb <em>v.</em> Stone, 11
Pick. 527, 534, 535; Wellington <em>v.</em> Small, 3 Cush. 145, 149; Bradley
<em>v.</em> Fuller, 118 Mass. 239, 241. See also Jenks <em>v.</em> Hoag, 179 Mass.
583, 585; Freeman <em>v.</em> Venner, 120 Mass. 424, 426, 427; Adler <em>v.</em>
Fenton, 24 How. 408, 410.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this case the averments are, in substance, that the defendant was
the executor and residuary legatee named in a will of one Jane V.
Corbin, and that she formed a purpose to give a legacy of $5000 to
Henry G. Lewis, the plaintiff’s father, who was her second cousin, that
she was over eighty years of age, and, for advice and assistance in
matters of business, was dependent upon the defendant, who occupied
a confidential relation towards her, that, wrongfully and fraudulently
intending and contriving to defeat her will and intention, and to deprive
and defraud Henry G. Lewis and his heirs of the sum of $5000,
he advised and procured the testatrix to execute a codicil to her will
in the presence of only one witness, namely, the defendant, whereas
the law of Rhode Island required the execution of the codicil in the
presence of more than one witness, as the defendant well knew. It is
then averred that the estate of the testatrix was large, and that, if the
codicil had not failed for want of due attestation owing to the fraud
practised by the defendant, the plaintiff would have received about
$1650.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether a person named as legatee has a remedy, in a case like this,
is a question which, so far as we know, has never been decided in this
Commonwealth. See Melanefy <em>v.</em> Morrison, 152 Mass. 473, 476. The
testatrix, desiring to give the legacy and intending to express her desire
in a way that would be effectual after her death, unless in the
meantime she should change her purpose, was fraudulently induced to
express it ineffectually, when she supposed that she had made a legal
and valid codicil. Plainly such fraudulent conduct was a wrong upon
the plaintiff as well as upon the testatrix. The question in the case is
whether the plaintiff has averred sufficient facts to show that damage
resulted to him directly as a consequence of the wrong. The defendant
relies strongly upon Hutchins <em>v.</em> Hutchins, 7 Hill, 104, decided by
the Supreme Court of New York. The declaration in that case
charged that the plaintiff’s father had made a will devising a farm to
the plaintiff, and that the defendants, who were interested in the
testator’s estate, he being a feeble man, advanced in years, and incapable
of transacting business, fraudulently induced him to make
another will in which the devise to the plaintiff was omitted. The
case was heard on a demurrer. The court said “Fraud without damage,
or damage without fraud gives no cause of action; but where
both concur, an action lies.... The only foundation of his claim
rests upon the mere unexecuted intention of his father to make a gift
<span class='pageno' id='Page_851'>851</span>of the property, and this cannot be said to have conferred a right of
any kind. To hold otherwise and sanction the doctrine contended for
by the plaintiff would be next to saying that every voluntary courtesy
was matter of legal obligation, and that private thoughts and intentions
concerning benevolent or charitable distributions of property
might be seized upon as the foundation of a right which the law would
deal with and protect.... But the law applicable to the cases referred
to proceeds upon the ground that the plaintiff, by the wrongful
act complained of, has been deprived of the present actual enjoyment
of some pecuniary advantage. No such damage can be pretended here.
At best the contemplated gift was not to be received until after the
death of the plaintiff, or the testator might change his mind, or lose
his property.” This case has been cited with approval in this Commonwealth
and elsewhere. Randall <em>v.</em> Hazelton, 12 Allen, 412, 416;
Emmons <em>v.</em> Alvord, 177 Mass. 466, 471; Adler <em>v.</em> Fenton, 24 How.
408, 410. We have been referred to no other decision upon similar
facts, and we have found no other. It seems pretty plain that, if a
suit were brought in the lifetime of the testator, immediately after
the practice of the fraud, no substantial damage could be recovered.
Very likely the court was right in deciding that no action could be
maintained. The plaintiff’s relation to the subject to which the fraud
was directed was not close enough to cause him pecuniary loss, apart
from the happening of subsequent events. Even if there were no
fraud the legacy might never take effect. The testator might lose his
property, or destroy his will, or make a different one. But the fraud
put the plaintiff in a less advantageous position than he otherwise
would have occupied in reference to the probability of receiving property
under the will, and this change of position, accomplished by a
fraud, naturally and probably might deprive him of that which, with
fair dealing, he would receive. It seems to us that, while the fraud
does not cause substantial damage apart from the happening of subsequent
events which reasonably may be expected to happen, if these
do happen, the defendant is chargeable with the natural consequences
of his act. Suppose, in the present case, that the testatrix did not
change her purpose to give the legacy of $5000 to Henry G. Lewis,
and that for the rest of her life she desired and intended that this
legacy should take effect, and thought that it would take effect. The
fraud then would be operative up to the time of her death, and would
accomplish the result intended by its author, by depriving the legatee
of that which otherwise he would have received. It is averred that
the testatrix left an estate sufficient to pay all or nearly all of this
legacy, with the others. If the facts supposed above are proved, does
it not follow that the fraud directly and proximately caused the plaintiff’s
loss of his legacy? The defendant cannot complain that these
supposed facts followed as conditions concurring with his fraud to
cause the damage. His fraud was planned in reference to the probability
<span class='pageno' id='Page_852'>852</span>that these events would follow. In Hutchins <em>v.</em> Hutchins,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, there was no averment to show that the fraud was operative up
to the time when the title to the property was changed by the death of
the testator. The court treated the case as if the testator might have
changed his purpose as to the disposition of his estate, for reasons of
his own independently of the fraud.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the declaration in the present case declares a result which
might justify an inference that the loss was caused by the fraud alone,
the averment seems hardly more than a statement of a conclusion of
law from the facts given previously. Upon demurrer we think the
pleading is defective in not averring facts which exclude the possibility
that the testatrix changed her purpose in regard to this legacy,
and which show that the fraud continued operative to the time of her
death, and thus caused the loss to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think the charge of fraud is a sufficient statement of an actionable
wrong. It charges much more than an expression of opinion by
which the testatrix was misled. The defendant is accused of having
dealt with a matter of fact, and with having fraudulently procured
the making of the codicil without sufficient attestation of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We infer from the record that the testatrix was domiciled in Massachusetts,
and that the construction of the will is governed by the law
of this State. Welch <em>v.</em> Adams, 152 Mass. 74, 79; Sewall <em>v.</em> Wilmer,

<h4 class='c013'>DULIN <em>v.</em> BAILEY<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, North Carolina, November 29, 1916.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 172 North Carolina Reports, 608.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Clark, C. J.</span> The complaint alleges that after the death of W. A.
Bailey the defendants conspired to deprive the plaintiff and others of
the benefits of his last will by removing from the paper writing to
which the sheet of paper containing the alleged signature of the deceased
was attached, that part providing for the legacy to the plaintiff
and others and substituting other provisions therefor. The plaintiff
contends that thereby a previous will has been admitted to probate.
In the course of the proceeding the plaintiff asked for the appointment
of a commissioner to take the examination of the defendants
in the nature of a bill of discovery. The defendants demurred that
the complaint did not state a cause of action. The court sustained
the demurrer, and held that unless the will that had been proven in
common form was attacked and set aside by caveat, the plaintiff could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_853'>853</span>not maintain the cause of action set out in the complaint. This put
an end to the plaintiff’s further progress in the cause, and she took a
nonsuit and appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff is not seeking to attack the will on record, nor to
probate what she alleges was a subsequent will. She is not seeking to
recover anything out of the estate, but is bringing an action of tort
against the parties who, as she alleges, conspired and injured her by
removing the clause of, and the signature to, what was a subsequent
will by which she would have received a legacy. It is an action of
spoliation by which she alleges the defendants have prevented her
receiving the sum of money which was due her if they had not fraudulently
altered and defaced the subsequent will. She alleges that she
does not attempt to set up the second will because the evidence accessible
to her would not prove its entire contents. She prefers, therefore,
to bring this action against the defendants for their wrong-doing
in fraudulently destroying the part of the will which was beneficial to
herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though this action seems to be of the first impression in this state,
and is doubtless a very unusual one, there is foundation and reason
for the action upon well-settled principles of law, and we are not entirely
without precedent. In Tucker <em>v.</em> Phipps, 3 Atkins, 359; cited
in Barnesly <em>v.</em> Powell, 1 Ves. Sr. 284, it was held that, the spoliation
being clearly proven, the plaintiff could maintain his action without
setting up the will by a probate. It was held that:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where a will is destroyed or concealed, while the general rule
is to probate the alleged will by proof in the Ecclesiastical Court
[which was there the court for probate wills], yet the legatee might
bring his action for the damage sustained by spoliation and suppression.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In that case the spoliation was alleged to have been a destruction
or concealment of the will by the executor. Such action against a
stranger is even more appropriate than an independent action against
the executor. Tucker <em>v.</em> Phipps is to be found in 26 English Reports
(Reprinted) 1008. Another case very much in point is Barnesley <em>v.</em>
Powell, 1 Ves. 119, 27 English Reports (Reprinted) 1034, in which
Tucker <em>v.</em> Phipps is cited as authority and the court also refers with
approval to</p>

<p class='c007'>“A late case where the defendant burned a will, in which was a
legacy to the plaintiff, so that it could not be proven in the Ecclesiastical
Court [which cannot prove a will on loose parts of the contents
of it], yet on the evidence of there being such a will, and the
defendants destroying it, the court decreed the legacy to the plaintiff,
as the defendant by his own iniquity had prevented the plaintiff from
coming at it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There may be other precedents, but the instances must have been
rare. Even if there had been no precedent, it would seem that, upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_854'>854</span>the principle of justice that there is “no wrong without a remedy,”
the plaintiff is entitled to maintain this action, if, as she alleges, the
defendants conspired and destroyed the subsequent will in which the
legacy was left her. If she cannot prove the destroyed will because
unable to prove the entire contents thereof (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In re</span></i> Hedgepeth, 150
N. C. 245, 63 S. E. 1025), surely she is entitled to recover of the
defendants for the wrong they have done her by the conspiracy and
destruction of the will, and the measure of her damages will be the
legacy of which she has been deprived. It may be very difficult for
her to prove her allegations by legal evidence and satisfactory to a
jury, but with that we have nothing to do. The only question presented
to us is the ruling of the court below that the complaint does
not state a cause of action, and in this we think the court below was
mistaken.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the action is not to set up the will, nor against the estate, but
against the defendants individually for their tort, the action could
be brought in the county where the plaintiff resides.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>RATCLIFFE <em>v.</em> EVANS<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Court of Appeal, May 26, 1892.</span><br /> <em>Reported in [1892] 2 Queen’s Bench, 524.</em></h4>

<p class='c022'>Motion to enter judgment for the defendant, or for a new trial, by way of
appeal from the judgment entered by Mr. Commissioner Bompas, Q. C., in an
action tried with a jury at the Chester Summer Assizes, 1891.</p>

<p class='c019'>The statement of claim in the action alleged that the plaintiff had for many
years carried on the business, at Hawarden in the county of Flint, of an engineer
and boiler-maker under the name of “Ratcliffe &amp; Sons,” having become
entitled to the good-will of the business upon the death of his father, who,
with others, had formerly carried on the business as “Ratcliffe &amp; Sons;”
that the defendant was the registered proprietor, publisher, and printer of a
weekly newspaper called the “County Herald,” circulated in Flintshire and
some of the adjoining counties, and that the plaintiff had suffered damage
by the defendant falsely and maliciously publishing and printing of the plaintiff
in relation to his business, in the “County Herald,” certain words set
forth which imported that the plaintiff had ceased to carry on his business of
engineer and boiler-maker, and that the firm of Ratcliffe &amp; Sons did not then
exist.</p>

<p class='c019'>At the trial the learned commissioner allowed the statement of claim to
be amended by adding that “by reason of the premises the plaintiff was injured
in his credit and reputation, and in his said business of an engineer and
boiler-maker, and he thereby lost profits which he otherwise would have made
in his said business.” The plaintiff proved the publication of the statements
complained of, and that they were untrue. He also proved a general loss of
business since the publication; but he gave no specific evidence of the loss
of any particular customers or orders by reason of such publication. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_855'>855</span>answer to questions left to them by the commissioner, the jury found that the
words did not reflect upon the plaintiff’s character, and were not libellous;
that the statement that the firm of Ratcliffe &amp; Sons was extinct was not published
<i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i>; and that the plaintiff’s business suffered injury to the extent
of £120 from the publication of that statement. The commissioner, upon
those findings, gave judgment for the plaintiff, for £120, with costs. The
defendant appealed.<a id='r557'></a><a href='#f557' class='c015'><sup>[557]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>The following judgment of the court (<span class='sc'>Lord Esher, M. R.</span>, <span class='sc'>Bowen</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Fry</span>, L.JJ.), was read by</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Bowen, L. J.</span> This was a case in which an action for a false and malicious
publication about the trade and manufactures of the plaintiff was tried at
the Chester assizes, with the result of a verdict for the plaintiff for £120.
Judgment having been entered for the plaintiff for that sum and costs, the defendant
appealed to this court for a new trial, or to enter a verdict for the
defendant, on the ground, amongst others, that no special damage, such as
was necessary to support the action, was proved at the trial. The injurious
statement complained of was a publication in the “County Herald,” a Welsh
newspaper. It was treated in the pleadings as a defamatory statement or
libel; but this suggestion was negatived, and the verdict of the jury proceeded
upon the view that the writing was a false statement purposely made about
the manufactures of the plaintiff, which was intended to, and did in fact,
cause him damage. The only proof at the trial of such damage consisted,
however, of evidence of general loss of business without specific proof of the
loss of any particular customers or orders, and the question we have to determine
is, whether in such an action such general evidence of damage was admissible
and sufficient. That an action will lie for written or oral falsehoods,
not actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i> nor even defamatory, where they are maliciously published,
where they are calculated in the ordinary course of things to produce,
and where they do produce, actual damage, is established law. Such an action
is not one of libel or of slander, but an action on the case for damage wilfully
and intentionally done without just occasion or excuse, analogous to an action
for slander of title. To support it actual damage must be shown, for it is an
action which only lies in respect of such damage as has actually occurred. It
was contended before us that in such an action it is not enough to allege and
prove general loss of business arising from the publication, since such general
loss is general and not special damage, and special damage, as often has been
said, is the gist of such an action on the case. Lest we should be led astray
in such a matter by mere words, it is desirable to recollect that the term
“special damage,” which is found for centuries in the books, is not always
used with reference to similar subject-matter, nor in the same context. At
times (both in the law of tort and of contract) it is employed to denote that
damage arising out of the special circumstances of the case which, if properly
pleaded, may be superadded to the general damage which the law implies in
every breach of contract and every infringement of an absolute right: see
Ashby <em>v.</em> White, 2 Ld. Raym. 938; 1 Sm. L. C. 9th ed. p. 268, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per</span></i> Holt, C. J.
In all such cases the law presumes that <em>some</em> damage will flow in the ordinary
course of things from the mere invasion of the plaintiff’s rights, and calls it
general damage. Special damage in such a context means the particular damage
(beyond the general damage), which results from the particular circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_856'>856</span>of the case, and of the plaintiff’s claim to be compensated, for which
he ought to give warning in his pleadings in order that there may be no surprise
at the trial. But where no actual and positive right (apart from the
damage done) has been disturbed, it is the damage done that is the wrong;
and the expression “special damage,” when used of this damage, denotes the
actual and temporal loss which has, in fact, occurred. Such damage is called
variously in old authorities, “express loss,” “particular damage:” Cane <em>v.</em>
Golding, Sty. 169; “damage in fact,” “special or particular cause of loss:”
Law <em>v.</em> Harwood, Cro. Car. 140; Tasburgh <em>v.</em> Day, Cro. Jac. 484.</p>

<p class='c019'>The term “special damage” has also been used in actions on the case
brought for a public nuisance, such as the obstruction of a river or a highway,
to denote that actual and particular loss which the plaintiff must allege and
prove that he has sustained beyond what is sustained by the general public, if
his action is to be supported, such particular loss being, as is obvious, the
cause of action: see Iveson <em>v.</em> Moore, 1 Ld. Raym. 486; Rose <em>v.</em> Groves, 5
M. &amp; G. 613. In this judgment we shall endeavor to avoid a term which,
intelligible enough in particular contexts, tends, when successively employed
in more than one context and with regard to different subject-matter, to encourage
confusion in thought. The question to be decided does not depend on
words, but is one of substance. In an action like the present, brought for a
malicious falsehood intentionally published in a newspaper about the plaintiff’s
business—a falsehood which is not actionable as a personal libel and
which is not defamatory in itself—is evidence to show that a general loss of
business has been the direct and natural result admissible in evidence, and, if
uncontradicted, sufficient to maintain the action? In the case of a personal
libel, such general loss of custom may unquestionably be alleged and proved.
Every libel is of itself a wrong in regard of which the law, as we have seen,
implies general damage. By the very fact that he has committed such a
wrong, the defendant is prepared for the proof that some general damage may
have been done. As is said by Gould, J., in Iveson <em>v.</em> Moore, 1 Ld. Raym. 486,
in actions against a wrong-doer a more general mode of declaring is allowed.
If, indeed, over and above this general damage, further particular damage is
under the circumstances to be relied on by the plaintiff, such particular damage
must of course be alleged and shown. But a loss of general custom, flowing
directly and in the ordinary course of things from a libel, may be alleged
and proved generally. “It is not special damage”—says Pollock, C. B., in
Harrison <em>v.</em> Pearce, 32 L. T. (O. S.) 298,—“it is general damage resulting
from the kind of injury the plaintiff has sustained.” So in Bluck <em>v.</em> Lovering, 1
Times L. R. 497, under a general allegation of loss of credit in business, general
evidence was received of a decline of business presumably due to the
publication of the libel, while loss of particular customers, not having been
pleaded, was held rightly to have been rejected at the trial: see also Ingram
<em>v.</em> Lawson, 6 Bing. N. C. 212. Akin to, though distinguishable in a respect
which will be mentioned from, actions of libel are those actions which are
brought for oral slander, where such slander consists of words actionable in
themselves and the mere use of which constitutes the infringement of the
plaintiff’s right. The very speaking of such words, apart from all damage,
constitutes a wrong and gives rise to a cause of action. The law in such a
case, as in the case of libel, presumes, and in theory allows, proof of general
damage. But slander, even if actionable in itself, is regarded as differing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_857'>857</span>from libel in a point which renders proof of general damage in slander cases
difficult to be made good. A person who publishes defamatory matter on paper
or in print puts in circulation that which is more permanent and more easily
transmissible than oral slander. Verbal defamatory statements may, indeed,
be intended to be repeated, or may be uttered under such circumstances that
their repetition follows in the ordinary course of things from their original
utterance. Except in such cases, the law does not allow the plaintiff to recover
damages which flow, not from the original slander, but from its unauthorized
repetition: Ward <em>v.</em> Weeks, 7 Bing. 211; Holwood <em>v.</em> Hopkins,
Cro. Eliz. 787; Dixon <em>v.</em> Smith, 5 H. &amp; N. 450. General loss of custom cannot
properly be proved in respect of a slander of this kind when it has been uttered
under such circumstances that its repetition does not flow directly and naturally
from the circumstances under which the slander itself was uttered. The
doctrine that in slanders actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i> general damage may be alleged and
proved with generality must be taken, therefore, with the qualification that
the words complained of must have been spoken under circumstances which
might in the ordinary course of things have directly produced the general
damage that has in fact occurred. Evans <em>v.</em> Harries, 1 H. &amp; N. 251, was a
slander uttered in such a manner. It consisted of words reflecting on an innkeeper
in the conduct of his business spoken openly in the presence of divers
persons, guests and customers of the inn—a floating and transitory class.
The court held that general evidence of the decline of business was rightly
receivable. “How,” asked Martin, B., “is a public-house keeper, whose only
customers are persons passing by, to show a damage resulting from the slander,
unless he is allowed to give general evidence of a loss of custom?” Macloughlin
<em>v.</em> Welsh, 10 Ir. L. Rep. 19, was an instance of excommunication in
open church. General proof was held to be rightly admitted that the plaintiff
was shunned and his mill abandoned, though no loss of particular customers
was shown. Here the very nature of the slander rendered it necessary that
such general proof should be allowed. The defamatory words were spoken
openly and publicly, and were intended to have the exact effect which was produced.
Unless such general evidence was admissible, the injury done could
not be proved at all. If, in addition to this general loss, the loss of particular
customers was to be relied on, such particular losses would, in accordance with
the ordinary rules of pleading, have been required to be mentioned in the
statement of claim: see Ashley <em>v.</em> Harrison, 1 Esp. 50. From libels and
slanders actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, we pass to the case of slanders not actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per
se</span></i>, where actual damage done is the very gist of the action. Many old authorities
may be cited for the proposition that in such a case the actual loss must
be proved specially and with certainty: Law <em>v.</em> Harwood, Cro. Car. 140.
Many such instances are collected in the judgments in Iveson <em>v.</em> Moore, 1 Ld.
Raym. 486, where, although there was a difference as to whether the general
rule had been fulfilled in that particular kind of action on the case, no doubt
was thrown on the principle itself. As was there said—in that language of
old pleaders which has seen its day, but which connoted more accuracy of legal
thought than is produced by modern statements of claim—“damages in the
‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per quod</span></i>,’ where the ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per quod</span></i>’ is the gist of the action, should be shown
certainly and specially.” But such a doctrine as this was always subject to
the qualification of good sense and of justice. Cases may here, as before,
occur where a general loss of custom is the natural and direct result of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_858'>858</span>slander, and where it is not possible to specify particular instances of the loss.
Hartley <em>v.</em> Herring, 8 T. R. 130, is probably a case of the kind, although it
does not appear from the report under what circumstances, or in the presence
of whom, the slanderous words were uttered. But if the words are uttered to
an individual, and repetition is not intended except to a limited extent, general
loss of custom cannot be ordinarily a direct and natural result of the limited
slander: Dixon <em>v.</em> Smith, 5 H. &amp; N. 450; Hopwood <em>v.</em> Thorn, 19 L. J. (C. P.)
95. The broad doctrine is stated in Buller’s Nisi Prius, p. 7, that where words
are not actionable, and the special damage is the gist of the action, saying
generally that several persons left the plaintiff’s house is not laying the special
damage. Slanders of title, written or oral, and actions such as the present,
brought for damage done by falsehoods, written or oral, about a man’s goods
or business, are similar in many respects to the last-mentioned class of slanders
not actionable in themselves. Damage is the gist of both actions alike,
and it makes no difference in this respect whether the falsehood is oral or in
writing: Malachy <em>v.</em> Soper. The necessity of alleging and proving actual
temporal loss with certainty and precision in all cases of the sort has been
insisted upon for centuries: Lowe <em>v.</em> Harewood, W. Jones, 196; Cane <em>v.</em>
Golding, Sty. 176; Tasburgh <em>v.</em> Day, Cro. Jac. 484; Evans <em>v.</em> Harlow, 5 Q. B.
624. But it is an ancient and established rule of pleading that the question
of generality of pleading must depend on the general subject-matter: Janson
<em>v.</em> Stuart, 1 T. R. 754; Lord Arlington <em>v.</em> Merricke, 2 Saund. 412, n. 4; Grey
<em>v.</em> Friar, 15 Q. B. 907; see Co. Litt. 303 d; Westwood <em>v.</em> Cowne, 1 Stark. 172;
Iveson <em>v.</em> Moore, 1 Ld. Raym. 486. In all actions accordingly on the case
where the damage actually done is the gist of the action, the character of the
acts themselves which produce the damage, and the circumstances under
which these acts are done, must regulate the degree of certainty and particularity
with which the damage done ought to be stated and proved. As much
certainty and particularity must be insisted on, both in pleading and proof of
damage, as is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances and to the nature
of the acts themselves by which the damage is done. To insist upon less would
be to relax old and intelligible principles. To insist upon more would be the
vainest pedantry. The rule to be laid down with regard to malicious falsehoods
affecting property or trade is only an instance of the doctrines of good
sense applicable to all that branch of actions on the case to which the class
under discussion belongs. The nature and circumstances of the publication
of the falsehood may accordingly require the admission of evidence of general
loss of business as the natural and direct result produced, and perhaps intended
to be produced. An instructive illustration, and one by which the
present appeal is really covered, is furnished by the case of Hargrave <em>v.</em> Le
Breton, 4 Burr. 2422, decided a century and a half ago. It was an example of
slander of title at an auction. The allegation in the declaration was that
divers persons who would have purchased at the auction left the place; but
no particular persons were named. The objection that they were not specially
mentioned was, as the report tells us, “easily” answered. The answer given
was that in the nature of the transaction it was impossible to specify names;
that the injury complained of was in effect that the bidding at the auction
had been prevented and stopped, and that everybody had gone away. It had,
therefore, become impossible to tell with certainty who would have been
bidders or purchasers if the auction had not been rendered abortive. This case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_859'>859</span>shows, what sound judgment itself dictates, that in an action for falsehood
producing damage to a man’s trade, which in its very nature is intended or
reasonably likely to produce, and which in the ordinary course of things does
produce, a general loss of business, as distinct from the loss of this or that
known customer, evidence of such general decline of business is admissible.
In Hargrave <em>v.</em> Le Breton it was a falsehood openly promulgated at an auction.
In the case before us to-day, it is a falsehood openly disseminated through the
press—probably read, and possibly acted on, by persons of whom the plaintiff
never heard. To refuse with reference to such a subject-matter to admit such
general evidence would be to misunderstand and warp the meaning of old
expressions; to depart from, and not to follow, old rules; and, in addition
to all this, would involve an absolute denial of justice and of redress for the
very mischief which was intended to be committed. It may be added that, so
far as the decision in Riding <em>v.</em> Smith can be justified, it must be justified on
the ground that the court (rightly or wrongly) believed the circumstances
under which the falsehood was uttered to have brought it within the scope
of a similar principle. In our opinion, therefore, there has been no misdirection
and no improper admission of evidence, and this appeal should be dismissed
with costs.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>DUDLEY <em>v.</em> BRIGGS<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, May 8, 1886.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 141 Massachusetts Reports, 582.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Tort. Writ dated Sept. 18, 1885. The declaration was as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the plaintiff says that he is, and has been for many years, a
compiler and publisher of directories of cities, towns, and counties in
this Commonwealth and elsewhere; that by care, attention, skill, and
faithfulness, and after great labor and expense, he had acquired a
large number of subscribers among business men and other people,
throughout the cities and towns of Bristol County, and elsewhere in
this Commonwealth, for ‘The Bristol County Directory,’ which the
plaintiff has compiled and published biennially for many years, and
until the acts and doings of the defendant hereinafter complained of;
that, at great labor and expense, he had acquired a large and valuable
list of advertisers in his said directory, from whom, as well as from
the said subscribers to said directory, he obtained a large income, and
would have continued to do so, but for the acts and doings of the
defendant hereinafter alleged and set forth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_860'>860</span>“And the plaintiff says that, according to his usual and ordinary
custom in the compilation and publication of the said ‘The Bristol
County Directory,’ he would have compiled and published the same in
this year, <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 1885, and he made his preparations therefor, but he
says that the defendant and his canvassers, and other servants and
agents, in order to injure the plaintiff, and to deprive him of the
opportunity of compiling and publishing said directory for said year
of 1885, and thereafterwards, and receiving the gains and profits therefrom,
and to secure the same to the defendant, together with all the
gains and profits arising therefrom, and otherwise to injure the plaintiff
and get gain, profit, and advantage to the defendant, knowingly
and wilfully, falsely and fraudulently, pretended and represented to
many persons, and particularly to the plaintiff’s patrons, the advertisers
in said directory and the subscribers thereto throughout said
Bristol County, that the plaintiff had gone out of the business of
compiling and publishing said directory, that the plaintiff had sold
out said business to the defendant, that the said canvassers and the
defendant’s other servants and agents were compiling the materials
for the plaintiff’s directory, the same as formerly, and other false and
fraudulent representations then and there made, of which the plaintiff
is not yet fully informed, and thereby deceitfully and wrongfully induced
the plaintiff’s said patrons, advertisers, and subscribers, in and
throughout said Bristol County, to give to the defendant their advertisements
and subscriptions, and to pay him instead of the plaintiff
therefor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whereas, in truth and in fact, the said representations were wholly
false and untrue; the plaintiff had neither gone out of the business of
compiling and publishing the said directory, as he had done for years
before, nor had he sold out to the defendant, nor had he any intention
of doing so; nor were the defendant and his canvassers, and other
agents and servants, compiling the said directory the same as formerly
or for the plaintiff; all of which the defendant, as well as his said
canvassers and other servants and agents, well knew. And the defendant
did knowingly, wrongfully, injuriously, and deceitfully compile
and publish the said ‘The Bristol County Directory,’ for the year <span class='fss'>A. D.</span>
1885, and vend and sell the same to the plaintiff’s patrons, advertisers,
subscribers, and other persons, as aforesaid. And the plaintiff says
that thereby he has been prevented from compiling, publishing, and
selling his said directory this year, <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 1885, as he has always done
heretofore; that he has lost the great gains and profits which he
would otherwise have made and received from the sale thereof, and
from advertisers in and subscribers to said directory, and has been
put to great loss and expense in preparing for said compilation and
publication, till he learned of the defendant’s said act and doings, and
thereby he will be hereafter prevented from compiling and publishing
said directory except at an increased expense and with diminished
profits.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_861'>861</span>The defendant demurred to the declaration, on the ground that it
did not set forth a legal cause of action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Superior Court sustained the demurrer; and ordered judgment
for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Field, J.</span> The plaintiff in his declaration does not allege that, by
the acts of the defendant, he has been deprived of the benefit of any
contract he had made, or of any property in existence and in his
possession, or that the defendant published his directory for 1885 as a
directory prepared and published by the plaintiff; and does not bring
his case within such decisions as Lumley <em>v.</em> Gye, Marsh <em>v.</em> Billings,
7 Cush. 322; Thomson <em>v.</em> Winchester, 19 Pick. 214; Blofeld <em>v.</em> Payne,
4 B. &amp; A. 410; Morison <em>v.</em> Salmon, 2 M. &amp; G. 385; and Sykes <em>v.</em>
Sykes, 3 B. &amp; C. 541.</p>

<p class='c007'>He does not allege that he had any copyright in the previous publications
which the publication of the defendant infringed; and the
courts of the Commonwealth have no jurisdiction over infringements
of copyright. If each publication of a directory by the plaintiff every
two years was a separate publication, then the plaintiff’s declaration
amounts to this,—that he intended to publish a directory for 1885,
whereby he expected to make profits, but, by reason of the acts of the
defendant, he abandoned such an intention, and lost the profits he
otherwise would have made. But an intention in the mind of the
plaintiff to compile and publish a directory is not property, and the
abandonment of such an intention is not a loss of property. Bradley
<em>v.</em> Fuller, 118 Mass. 239.</p>

<p class='c007'>An attempt has been made to bring this case within what is called
slander of goods, manufactured and sold by another. See Western
Counties Manure Co. <em>v.</em> Lawes Chemical Manure Co., L. R. 9 Ex. 218.
This implies that the plaintiff was engaged in the business of making
and selling directories, and that the defendant made statements disparaging
the plaintiff’s business. We think that the declaration does
not show that the business of the plaintiff, in publishing a new directory
every two years, was a continuous business. The directory to be
published in 1885 was to be a new compilation and publication. From
the nature of the book, perhaps this could not well be otherwise. New
subscribers and new advertisements were to be obtained. We have
been shown no case where it has been held that a false statement that
the plaintiff had gone out of business, or sold out his business to the
defendant, was an actionable slander of a person in his trade; but
upon this we express no opinion. It may be said that such statements
tend to injure a man in his business, because they tend to prevent customers
from resorting to him for trade, and to injure the value of the
good-will of his business. However this may be, the difficulty is in
attaching good-will as a valuable thing to the publication every two
years of a new directory. Such a directory could be published by anybody.
It is perhaps a question of degree whether the publication by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_862'>862</span>the plaintiff had been so frequent and regular that there can be said
to be a good-will that would be protected in law. There is no allegation
of any continuing contract, express or implied, of subscribing for,
or advertising in, the directories, as a publication periodically issued;
there is no allegation of any place of business to which customers
resorted to purchase directories. Until the plaintiff had entered upon
the compilation of the directory for 1885, we do not think that there
was any business of publishing a directory for 1885 carried on by the
plaintiff, or anything that, for example, could have been sold as a
going concern by an assignee in insolvency, if the plaintiff had become
an insolvent debtor. The cases upon liability for wrongful interference
with the business of another are largely collected in Walker <em>v.</em>
Cronin; but in that case there was an actual business, with the carrying
on of which the defendant wrongfully interfered. The declaration
in this case, indeed, alleges that the plaintiff made his preparations
for compiling and publishing a directory for 1885, but it does not
allege what those preparations were, or that they were anything valuable.
The averment that he “has been put to great loss and expense
in preparing for said compilation and publication,” near the end of
the declaration, appears to be a part of the damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff cites Swan <em>v.</em> Tappan, 5 Cush. 104, but there the
declaration was held insufficient, because there was no allegation of
special damage. The declaration in the present case cannot well be
distinguished in this respect from the declaration in Swan <em>v.</em> Tappan,
but we do not deem it necessary to reconsider the decision in that case
on this point. There, the plaintiff was actually engaged in selling
his book, which had already been printed and put upon the market,
and the action was the ordinary action for the malicious disparagement
of the goods of another, manufactured and kept for sale.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff relies upon Benton <em>v.</em> Pratt, 2 Wend. 385, which perhaps
may be considered as an extreme case. See Randall <em>v.</em> Hazelton,
12 All. 412. In Benton <em>v.</em> Pratt, Seagraves and Wilson, at Allentown,
had orally agreed to purchase of the plaintiff two hundred hogs, at the
market price, if delivered within three or four weeks, and they had not
been previously supplied; and, “about the time for the delivery,” the
plaintiff was proceeding with his drove of hogs to Allentown for the
purpose of delivering to them two hundred hogs. The defendant, by
his falsehood and deceit, intentionally prevented the performance of
this contract, by persuading Seagraves and Wilson that the plaintiff
was not intending to drive his hogs to Allentown, whereby they were
induced to buy the hogs of the defendant, instead of buying the hogs
of the plaintiff, as they otherwise would have done. The court say,
that it was “not material whether the contract of the plaintiff with
Seagraves and Wilson was binding upon them or not;” but the agreement,
if there was an agreement, although not in writing, was an
actual offer by Seagraves and Wilson, not revoked, and which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_863'>863</span>would have performed, and the plaintiff was in the actual possession
of the property which Seagraves and Wilson had offered to buy, and
was actually proceeding to deliver this property to them, in accordance
with their offer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fatal objection to the present case is, that it is entirely problematical
whether the plaintiff would actually have published a directory
if the defendant had not made the fraudulent misrepresentations
alleged. The plaintiff abandoned his intention to compile and publish
a directory in consequence of the defendant’s acts; but this, upon
the principles stated in Bradley <em>v.</em> Fuller, 118 Mass. 239, and the
cases therein cited, is not sufficient to support an action.</p>

<p class='c014'>Action on the case. Whereas he was a Freemason, and used to sell
stones, and to make stone buildings, and was possessed of a lease for
divers years to come of a stone-pit in Hedington, in the county of
Oxford, and digged divers stones there, as well to sell as to build
withal; that the defendant, to discredit and to deprive him of the
commodity of the said mine, imposed so many and so great threats
upon his workmen, and all comers disturbed, threatening to mayhem
and vex them with suits if they bought any stones; whereupon they
all desisted from buying, and the others from working, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>After judgment by <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nihil dicit</span></i> for the plaintiff, and damages found

</div>

<p class='c014'>This was a special action on the case. The declaration stated that
the plaintiffs had sent a vessel called the “Bannister,” with a crew on
board, under the command of one Thomas Smith, and loaded with
goods proper for trading with the natives, to a part of the coast of
Africa called Cameroon, to trade with the natives there. That while
the last-mentioned ship was lying off Cameroon, a canoe with some
natives on board came to the same for the purpose of establishing a
trade, and went back to the shore, of which defendant had notice.
And that he well knowing the premises, but <em>contriving and maliciously
intending to hinder and deter the natives from trading</em> with the
said Thomas Smith, for the benefit of the plaintiffs, with force and
arms, fired from a certain ship called the “Othello” of which he was
master and commander, a certain cannon loaded with gunpowder
and shot, at the said canoe, and killed one of the natives on board the
same. <em>Whereby the natives of the said coast were deterred and hindered
from trading with the said T. Smith for the benefit, &amp;c., and
plaintiffs lost their trade.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Kenyon.</span> This action is brought by the plaintiffs to recover a
satisfaction for a civil injury which they have sustained. The injury
complained of is, that by the improper conduct of the defendant the
natives were prevented from trading with the plaintiffs. The whole
of the case is stated on the record, and if the parties desire it, the
opinion of the court may hereafter be taken whether it will support
an action. I am of opinion it will. Had this been an accidental thing,
no action could have been maintained; but it is proved that the defendant
had expressed an intention not to permit any to trade, until a
debt due from the natives to himself was satisfied. If there was any
court in that country to which he could have applied for justice he
might have done so, but he had no right to take the law into his own
hands.<a id='r560'></a><a href='#f560' class='c015'><sup>[560]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>This came before the court on a case reserved upon the following
question: Whether under the circumstances of this case the plaintiff
was entitled to recover? It was an action of trespass on the case for
enticing away several of the plaintiff’s servants, who used to work for

Martin and Clayton were employed as journeymen shoemakers by the
plaintiff, but for no determinate time, but only by the piece, and had,
at the time of the trespass laid, each of them a pair of shoes unfinished;
that the defendant persuaded them to enter into his service, and to
leave these shoes unfinished, which they accordingly did.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Mr. Darwell</em>, for the plaintiff, stated it to be a question of common
law, and that the only point for the opinion of the court was, “whether
a journeyman was such a servant as the law takes notice of?” In
support of which proposition he insisted that a journeyman is as much
a servant as any other person who works for hire or wages; that
neither in reason nor at common law is there any distinction between
a servant in one capacity or another, and that the injury of seduction
is in all cases the same, though the recompense in damages may be
different. He pressed the argument <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab inconvenienti</span></i>, stating that it
would be of great detriment to the town, where the whole trade was in
a great measure carried on by this sort of servant. That the verdict
had found the defendant to be apprised of the retainer of the servants,
it being in proof that he had desired them to leave their work then in
hand unfinished.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Mr. Willes</em>, contra. The single question is, whether the enticing
away a journeyman shoemaker, who is hired to make a single pair of
shoes, is such an injury to his master as that an action will lie for it.
Now the jury have found that there was no hiring for any determinate
time, but only by the piece: if so, they could not be the plaintiff’s servants;
for the term “journeyman” does not import that they belong
to any particular master.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Mansfield</span> interrupted him. The question is, whether saying
that such a one is a man’s journeyman, is as much as to say that he is
such a man’s servant; that is, whether the jury, by finding him to be
the plaintiff’s journeyman, do not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex vi termini</span></i> find him to be his
servant. A journeyman is a servant by the day; and it makes no
difference whether the work is done by the day or by the piece. He
was certainly retained to finish the work he had undertaken, and the
defendant knowingly enticed him to leave it unfinished.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is the gist of the action? That the defendant has enticed a
man away who stood in the relation of servant to the plaintiff, and by
whom he was to be benefited. I think the point turns upon the jury
finding that the persons enticed away were employed by the plaintiff
as his journeymen. It might perhaps have been different if the men
had taken work for everybody, and after the plaintiff had employed
them the defendant had applied to them, and they had given the
preference to him in point of time. For if a man lived in his own
house and took in work for different people, it would be a strong
ground to say that he was not the journeyman of any particular master;
but the gist of the present action is that they were attached to
this particular master.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_866'>866</span><span class='sc'>Aston, J.</span> It is clear that a master may maintain an action against
any one for taking and enticing away his servant, upon the ground of
the interest which he has in his service and labor.<a id='r561'></a><a href='#f561' class='c015'><sup>[561]</sup></a> And even supposing,
as my lord has stated, that the servant did live in his own
house, if he were employed to finish a certain number of shoes for a
particular person by a fixed time, and a third person enticed him
away, I think an action would lie. If not, it might be of very bad
consequence in trade. He is a servant <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quoad hoc</span></i>, and though the
seducer and enticer is much the worse, yet the law inflicts a penalty
upon workmen leaving their work undone.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>The first count of the declaration stated that Louisa Evans was and
still is the servant of the plaintiff in his business of a publican and
victualler; and that the defendant, well knowing the same, wrongfully
enticed and procured the said Louisa Evans unlawfully and without
the consent and against the will of the plaintiff, her said master, to
depart from the service of the plaintiff; whereby the plaintiff had lost
the service of the said Louisa Evans in his said business.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pleas: Not guilty; and that Louisa Evans was not the servant of
the plaintiff, as alleged. Issue thereon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cause was tried before Pigott, B., at the last Spring Assizes at
Oxford. The plaintiff was a licensed victualler in Birmingham, and
was assisted in his business by his daughter Louisa, a girl about nineteen
years of age, who served in the bar and kept the accounts. On
the 10th of November, 1866, the daughter, with her mother’s permission,
which was procured by means of a fabricated letter purporting
to be an invitation to her to spend a few days with a friend at Manchester,
left the plaintiff’s house and went to a lodging-house in the
neighborhood of Birmingham, where she cohabited with the defendant,
at whose dictation the above-mentioned letter had been written.
On the 19th of November the daughter returned home, and resumed
her duties for a short time, but ultimately left her home again, and on
the 9th of February was again found cohabiting with the defendant at
the same lodging-house.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the part of the defendant it was submitted that, in order to sustain
the action, in the absence of an allegation that the defendant had
debauched the plaintiff’s daughter, it was necessary to show a binding
contract of service.</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned Baron, after consulting Blackburn, J., intimated an
opinion that the action would lie upon the declaration as framed; but
he reserved to the defendant leave to move to enter a nonsuit if the
court should be of opinion that in point of law the action was not
maintainable,—the court to have power to draw any inferences of
fact, and to amend the declaration if necessary, according to the facts
proved.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case was then left to the jury, who returned a verdict for the
plaintiff, damages, £50.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Huddleston</em>, Q. C., in Easter term, obtained a rule <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Powell</em>, Q. C., and <em>J. O. Griffits</em> (June 11) showed cause, submitting
that the action would lie upon the declaration as it stood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court called on</p>

<p class='c007'><em>H. James</em> and <em>Jelf</em>, in support of the rule. There are two kinds of
action for loss of service, viz., an action for the seduction and consequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_869'>869</span>loss of service of a daughter, and an action for enticing away a
servant. In order to sustain the first, it is not enough that there has
been criminal intercourse, but it must be shown that that intercourse
has resulted in pregnancy or other illness so as to cause a disability in
the daughter to perform her accustomed duties: Eager <em>v.</em> Grimwood;
Boyle <em>v.</em> Brandon, 13 M. &amp; W. 738; but an actual contract of service
need not be proved. It is not suggested that there is any such cause
of action here. In Sedgwick on Damages (2d ed.), page 543, it is
said that “although the defendant be guilty of the seduction, but the
jury are of opinion that the child is not his, the plaintiff cannot recover.
In other words, without some damage to the plaintiff or master
occasioned by the illness of the female, and resulting from the illicit
intercourse, the plaintiff is without relief.” And for this Eager <em>v.</em>
Grimwood is cited.</p>

<p class='c007'>[<span class='sc'>Bovill, C. J.</span> Eager <em>v.</em> Grimwood is cited in Smith’s Leading
Cases (6th ed.), vol. i. p. 260, with evident disapprobation.]</p>

<p class='c007'>No precedent is to be found without the allegation <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per quod servitium
amisit</span></i>. The action for seduction is an anomalous one.</p>

<p class='c007'>[<span class='sc'>Willes, J.</span> Upon the first point, I think we are bound by the case
of Eager <em>v.</em> Grimwood. The question is, whether the action may not
be maintained for enticing the girl away from her father’s service.]</p>

<p class='c007'>To sustain an action for enticing away a servant, it is necessary to
show a valid and binding contract of service, which has been broken
through the procurement of the defendant. Actual service is not
enough. Here, there was no contract, express or implied, for the
breach of which the father could have sued his daughter. All that the
defendant can be charged with having done is, inciting the daughter
to do that which in the exercise of her own free will she had an undoubted
right to do. If an action would lie for this, it would equally
lie for inducing a daughter to quit her father’s house for the purpose
of marrying her.<a id='r565'></a><a href='#f565' class='c015'><sup>[565]</sup></a> See Fitz. N. B. 90 H. In Cox <em>v.</em> Muncey, 6 C. B.
<span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 375, it was held by this court that no action will lie for enticing
away an apprentice, unless there be a valid contract of apprenticeship;
and the like was held as to a servant by the Court of Queen’s
Bench in Sykes <em>v.</em> Dixon, 9 Ad. &amp; E. 693; 1 P. &amp; D. 463.</p>

<p class='c007'>[<span class='sc'>Bovill, C. J.</span> At the end of Lord Denman’s judgment, in Sykes
<em>v.</em> Dixon, there is a remark which seems to be adverse to your view.
“Then,” says his Lordship, “it was argued, on the authority of
Keane <em>v.</em> Boycott, 2 H. Bl. 511, that the objection” (that is, to the
validity of the contract) “was not one which a third person could
take: and that might be so in a case where the servant was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i>
continuing in the service; but not here, where he had quitted his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_870'>870</span>master, and taken his chance in hiring himself to the defendant.”
Here the daughter was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i> continuing in the service of her father
when the defendant seduced her therefrom.]</p>

<p class='c007'>All the authorities were referred to in Lumley <em>v.</em> Gye, and amongst
them Blake <em>v.</em> Lanyon; but in none of them was the action held to lie
in the absence of a binding contract of service.<a id='r566'></a><a href='#f566' class='c015'><sup>[566]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bovill, C. J.</span> The rule in this case was granted principally on the
contention of the defendant’s counsel that, in order to sustain the
action, it was necessary to show that there was a binding contract of
service between the father and the daughter. And for this proposition
various text-books were referred to, and several cases cited, amongst
which was that of Sykes <em>v.</em> Dixon, 9 Ad. &amp; E. 693; 1 P. &amp; D. 463.
But, when that case is looked at, I find no such principle involved in
the decision. Indeed, in each of the cases, from the form of the
declaration, it became necessary to prove some contract for service
beyond that which the law would imply from the relation of the parties.
No authority is to be found where it has been held that in an
action for enticing away the plaintiff’s daughter a binding contract
of service must be alleged and proved. But there are abundant authorities
to show the contrary. It is said that the case of seduction is
anomalous in this respect. There is, however, no foundation for that
assertion. In the case of an action for the seduction of a daughter,
no proof of service is necessary beyond the services implied from the
daughter’s living in her father’s house as a member of his family. So,
in the case of an action for assaulting the plaintiff’s infant son or
daughter, no evidence of service is necessary beyond that which the
law will imply as between parent and child. In Barber <em>v.</em> Dennis,
6 Mod. 69; 1 Salk. 68, the widow of a waterman, who, as was said,
by the usage of Waterman’s Hall, may take an apprentice, had her
apprentice taken from her and put on board a Queen’s ship, where he
earned two tickets, which came to the defendant’s hands, and for
which the mistress brought trover. It was agreed that the action
would well lie if the apprentice were a legal apprentice, for his possession
would be that of his master, and whatever he earns shall go
to his master; but it was objected that the company of watermen is a
voluntary society, and that being free of it does not make a man free
of London, so that the custom of London for persons under one and
twenty to bind themselves apprentices does not extend to watermen;
which was agreed by all. Then it was said that the supposed apprentice
here was no legal apprentice, if the indentures be not enrolled
pursuant to the 5 Eliz. c. 4, and, if he were not a legal apprentice, the
plaintiff had no title. But Holt, C. J., said he would understand him
an apprentice or servant <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i>, and that would suffice against them,
being wrong-doers. Again, in Fitz. N. B. 91 G. it is laid down that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_871'>871</span>“if a man ought to have toll in a fair, &amp;c., and his servants are disturbed
in gathering the same, he shall have trespass for assault of his
servants, and for the loss of their service,” &amp;c. To this is appended a
note by Lord Hale: “Trespass for beating his servants, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per quod
servitium amisit</span></i>, lies, although he was not retained, but served only at
will. 11 Hen. IV. fol. 2, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per</span></i> Hull, accordant. And so if A. retains B.
to be his servant, who departs into another county and serves C., A.,
before any request or seizure, cannot beat B.; and, if he does, C. shall
have trespass against him (21 Hen. VI. fol. 9), and recover damages,
having regard to the loss of service (22 Ass. 76): and the retainer is
traversable. 11 Hen. VI. fol. 30.” These authorities, and the principle
upon which the action for assaulting a servant is founded, would
seem to show that an actual binding contract is not necessary. There
is no allegation in this declaration of a hiring for any definite time.
All that is alleged is, that the girl was the daughter and servant of the
plaintiff. It cannot be doubted that the jury would infer from the
facts that the relation of master and servant did exist, without any
evidence of a contract for a definite time; and, if we are to draw inferences
from the facts, I should come to the same conclusion. Then,
was that relation put an end to? The service, no doubt, was one which
would be determinable at the will of either party, as is said by Bramwell,
B., in Thompson <em>v.</em> Ross, 5 H. &amp; N. 16. That this kind of service
is sufficient, I should gather from the language used by this
court in Hartley <em>v.</em> Cummings, 5 C. B. 247, and particularly from
the judgment of Maule, J. That was an action for seducing workmen
from the service of the plaintiff, a glass and alkali manufacturer,
and harboring them after notice. It appeared that one Pike was in
the service of the plaintiff, and the defendant induced him to leave.
In giving judgment, Maule, J., says: “The objection urged on the
part of the defendant is, that the agreement entered into by Pike with
the plaintiff was one that gave the latter no right to compel Pike to
serve him, inasmuch as it was void either for want of mutuality or
because it was a contract to an unreasonable extent operating in restraint
of trade. On the other side, it was insisted, upon the authority
of Keane <em>v.</em> Boycott, 2 H. Bl. 511, that it is quite immaterial, for the
purpose of this action, whether the agreement was void or not; for
that it is not competent to the defendants, who are wrong-doers, to
take advantage of its invalidity. In answer to this, the case of Sykes
<em>v.</em> Dixon, 9 Ad. &amp; E. 693; 1 P. &amp; D. 463, was cited on the part of the
defendants, where it is said to have been decided by the Court of
Queen’s Bench that such an objection may be set up by a third person
not a party to the agreement. It is unnecessary to say whether that
case may not be distinguished from the present,—there being no
subsisting service that was interrupted by the act of the defendant,—because
I am of opinion that in this case there was a contract between
Hartley and Pike, which was perfectly valid, notwithstanding the objections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_872'>872</span>that have been urged.” Whether or not there was a subsisting
service seems to be the test. I think the jury properly assumed that
there was a subsisting service here. It is said that the girl’s services
were not lost to the plaintiff by reason of the defendant’s having enticed
her away; for that, inasmuch as she afterwards returned to her
father’s house, the relation of master and servant was not put an end
to by any act of the defendant’s. I think however, there was a sufficient
interruption of the service to entitle the plaintiff to maintain
the action, and that the rule to enter a nonsuit should be discharged.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Willes, J.</span> I am of the same opinion. I cannot look at it as an
anomaly to hold that the daughter was the servant of her father at the
time the defendant by his enticement induced her to forbear from
rendering to her father the services which were due to him from her.
There is a series of cases in the books, of which that in the Year-Book
of 11 Hen. IV, fol. 2, is probably the first, to show that this action is
maintainable. This case was followed by a very remarkable one of
M. 22 Hen. VI, fol. 30, in which that doctrine is fully recognized, and
where service at will and service upon a retainer are put upon the
same footing with regard to any complaint of being wrongfully deprived
of their fruits, and it is pointed out that the writ at common
law ran, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quare un tiel servientem meum in servitio meo existentem
cepit et abduxit</span></i>,” without alleging any contract or retainer. That
runs so completely with the earlier case, and also with the doctrine of
Lord Denman in Sykes <em>v.</em> Dixon, 9 Ad. &amp; E. 693, 699; 1 P. &amp; D. 463,
and of Maule, J., in Hartley <em>v.</em> Cummings, 5 C. B. 247, and also with
the observations of Bramwell, B., in Thompson <em>v.</em> Ross, that I feel no
difficulty in holding that, upon authority, as well as in good sense, the
father of a family, in respect of such service as his daughter renders
him from her sense of duty and filial gratitude, stands in the same
position as an ordinary master. If she is in his service, whether <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de son
bon gre</span></i> or <em>sur retainer</em>, he is equally entitled to her services, and to
maintain an action against one who entices her away. Assuming that
the service was at the will of both parties, like a tenancy at will, the
relation must be put an end to in some way before the rights of the
master under it can be lost. As a question of fact, was the daughter
in the service of her father at the time the cause of action arose? Was
the relation of master and servant put an end to by her quitting her
father’s house by means of the false pretence to which the defendant
induced her to resort? There was no proof that she quitted without
any intention to return to her home. What pretence, then, was there
for assuming that the service at will was put an end to? To use the
language of Newton, J., in the case of 22 Hen. VI, fol. 30, it is no
more than if a servant should absent herself for the purpose of going
to church on the Sabbath day. Then, was the defendant guilty of any
wrong in keeping her away from the plaintiff’s service? I apprehend
that, where the relation of master and servant exists, any fraud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_873'>873</span>whereby the servant is induced to absent herself affords a ground of
action. Somewhat the same sort of question arose in Winsmore <em>v.</em>
Greenbank, where, in an action on the case for inducing the plaintiff’s
wife to continue absent, it was held to be sufficient to state that “the
defendant unlawfully and unjustly persuaded, procured, and enticed
the wife to continue absent, &amp;c., by means of which persuasion, &amp;c.,
she did continue absent, &amp;c., whereby the plaintiff lost the comfort and
society of his wife,” &amp;c., without setting forth the means used by the
defendant, or alleging that any adultery had been committed. There
is really no difficulty when once the relation of master and servant at
the time of the acts complained of is established. It was said that,
inasmuch as none of the usual consequences, such as sickness or the
birth of a child, resulted from the defendant’s acts, no action is maintainable
for the mere improper intercourse. Be it so, as there is an
authority in favor of that position; but that only removes the charge
of debauching the plaintiff’s daughter out of the way. It does seem
to me to be an extraordinary thing, and to reduce the argument to an
absurdity, to say that the plaintiff would have had a sufficient cause
of action against the defendant if the daughter had proved with child
by him, and had gone back to her father’s house and been confined
there, and that the fact of the father having through his fraud been
deprived of his daughter’s services during the nine days’ concubinage
affords no ground of action. The conclusion I arrive at is, that it was
a question for the jury whether at the time the daughter left her
father’s house there was an existing service <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i>, and whether by
the defendant’s means and procurement that service was denied to the
plaintiff. If both those questions were found against the defendant,
the plaintiff was clearly entitled to the verdict. I think there was
abundant evidence to support the finding, and that the rule must be
discharged.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Crompton, J.</span><a id='r568'></a><a href='#f568' class='c015'><sup>[568]</sup></a> The declaration in this case consisted of three
counts. The two first stated a contract between the plaintiff, the proprietor
of the Queen’s Theatre, and Miss Wagner, for the performance
by her for a period of three months at the plaintiff’s theatre; and it
then stated that the defendant, knowing the premises and with a
malicious intention, whilst the agreement was in full force, and before
the expiration of the period for which Miss Wagner was engaged,
wrongfully and maliciously enticed and procured Miss Wagner to
refuse to sing or perform at the theatre, and to depart from and abandon
her contract with the plaintiff and all service thereunder, whereby
Miss Wagner wrongfully, during the full period of the engagement,
refused and made default in performing at the theatre; and special
damage arising from the breach of Miss Wagner’s engagement was
then stated. The third count stated that Miss Wagner had been hired
and engaged by the plaintiff, then being the owner of her Majesty’s
Theatre, to perform at the said theatre for a certain specified period
as the dramatic artiste of the plaintiff for reward to her in that behalf,
and had become and was such dramatic artiste for the plaintiff at his
said theatre for profit to the plaintiff in that behalf; and that the
defendant, well knowing the premises and with a malicious intention,
whilst Miss Wagner was such artiste of the plaintiff, wrongfully and
maliciously enticed and procured her, so being such artiste of the
plaintiff, to depart from and out of the said employment of the plaintiff,
whereby she wrongfully departed from and out of the said service
and employment of the plaintiff, and remained and continued absent
from such service and employment until the expiration of her said
hiring and engagement to the plaintiff by effluxion of time; and
special damage arising from the breach of Miss Wagner’s engagement
was then stated. To this declaration the defendant demurred; and
the question for our decision is, Whether all or any of the counts are
good in substance?</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect of the two first counts is, that a person, under a binding
contract to perform at a theatre, is induced by the malicious act of
the defendant to refuse to perform and entirely to abandon her contract;
whereby damage arises to the plaintiff, the proprietor of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_875'>875</span>theatre. The third count differs, in stating expressly that the performer
had agreed to perform as the dramatic artiste of the plaintiff,
and <em>had become and was</em> the dramatic artiste of the plaintiff for
reward to her; and that the defendant maliciously procured her to
depart out of the employment of the plaintiff as such dramatic artiste;
whereby she did depart out of the employment and service of the
plaintiff; whereby damage was suffered by the plaintiff. It was said,
in support of the demurrer, that it did not appear in the declaration
that the relation of master and servant ever subsisted between the
plaintiff and Miss Wagner; that Miss Wagner was not averred, especially
in the two first counts, to have entered upon the service of
the plaintiff; and that the engagement of a theatrical performer, even
if the performer has entered upon the duties, is not of such a nature
as to make the performer a servant, within the rule of law which gives
an action to the master for the wrongful enticing away of his servant.
And it was laid down broadly, as a general proposition of law, that no
action will lie for procuring a person to break a contract, although
such procuring is with a malicious intention and causes great and
immediate injury. And the law as to enticing servants was said to be
contrary to the general rule and principle of law, and to be anomalous,
and probably to have had its origin from the state of society when
serfdom existed, and to be founded upon, or upon the equity of, the
Statute of Laborers. It was said that it would be dangerous to hold
that an action was maintainable for persuading a third party to break
a contract, unless some boundary or limits could be pointed out; and
that the remedy for enticing away servants was confined to cases
where the relation of master and servant, in a strict sense, subsisted
between the parties; and that, in all other cases of contract, the only
remedy was against the party breaking the contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever may have been the origin or foundation of the law as to
enticing of servants, and whether it be, as contended by the plaintiff,
an instance and branch of a wider rule, or whether it be, as contended
by the defendant, an anomaly and an exception from the general rule
of law on such subjects, it must now be considered clear law that a person
who wrongfully and maliciously, or, which is the same thing, with
notice, interrupts the relation subsisting between master and servant
by procuring the servant to depart from the master’s service, or by
harboring and keeping him as servant after he has quitted it and during
the time stipulated for as the period of service, whereby the master
is injured, commits a wrongful act for which he is responsible at law. I
think that the rule applies wherever the wrongful interruption operates
to prevent the service during the time for which the parties have
contracted that the service shall continue; and I think that the relation
of master and servant subsists, sufficiently for the purpose of such
action, during the time for which there is in existence a binding contract
of hiring and service between the parties; and I think that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_876'>876</span>a fanciful and technical and unjust distinction to say that the not
having actually entered into the service, or that the service not actually
continuing, can make any difference. The wrong and injury are
surely the same, whether the wrong-doer entices away the gardener,
who has hired himself for a year, the night before he is to go to his
work, or after he has planted the first cabbage on the first morning of
his service; and I should be sorry to support a distinction so unjust,
and so repugnant to common sense, unless bound to do so by some
rule or authority of law plainly showing that such distinction
exists....<a id='r569'></a><a href='#f569' class='c015'><sup>[569]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The objection as to the actual employment not having commenced
would not apply in the present case to the third count, which states
that Miss Wagner had become the artiste of the plaintiff, and that the
defendant had induced her to depart from the employment. But it was
further said that the engagement, employment or service, in the present
case, was not of such a nature as to constitute the relation of master
and servant, so as to warrant the application of the usual rule of
law giving a remedy in case of enticing away servants. The nature of
the injury and of the damage being the same, and the supposed right
of action being in strict analogy to the ordinary case of master and
servant, I see no reason for confining the case to services or engagements
under contracts for services of any particular description; and
I think that the remedy, in the absence of any legal reason to the contrary,
may well apply to all cases where there is an unlawful and malicious
enticing away of any person employed to give his personal labor
or service for a given time under the direction of a master or employer
who is injured by the wrongful act; more especially when the party is
bound to give such personal services exclusively to the master or
employer; though I by no means say that the service need be exclusive....<a id='r570'></a><a href='#f570' class='c015'><sup>[570]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In deciding this case on the narrower ground, I wish by no means to
be considered as deciding that the larger ground taken by Mr. <em>Cowling</em>
is not tenable, or as saying that in no case except that of master and
servant is an action maintainable for <em>maliciously</em> inducing another to
break a contract to the injury of the person with whom such contract
has been made. It does not appear to me to be a sound answer, to
say that the act in such cases is the act of the party who breaks the
contract; for that reason would apply in the acknowledged case of
master and servant. Nor is it an answer, to say that there is a remedy
against the contractor, and that the party relies on the contract; for,
besides that reason also applying to the case of master and servant, the
action on the contract and the action against the malicious wrong-doer
may be for a different matter; and the damages occasioned by such
malicious injury might be calculated on a very different principle from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_877'>877</span>the amount of the debt which might be the only sum recoverable on
the contract. Suppose a trader, <em>with a malicious intent to ruin a
rival trader</em>, goes to a banker or other party who owes money to his
rival, and begs him not to pay the money which he owes him, and by
that means ruins or greatly prejudices the party: I am by no means
prepared to say that an action could not be maintained, and that damages,
beyond the amount of the debt if the injury were great, or much
less than such amount if the injury were less serious, might not be
recovered. Where two or more parties were concerned in inflicting
such injury, an indictment, or a writ of conspiracy at common law,
might perhaps have been maintainable; and, where a writ of conspiracy
would lie for an injury inflicted by two, an action on the case
in the nature of conspiracy will generally lie; and in such action on
the case the plaintiff is entitled to recover against one defendant without
proof of any conspiracy, the malicious injury and not the conspiracy
being the gist of the action.<a id='r571'></a><a href='#f571' class='c015'><sup>[571]</sup></a> In this class of cases it must be
assumed that it is the malicious act of the defendant, and that malicious
act only, which causes the servant or contractor not to perform
the work or contract which he would otherwise have done. The servant
or contractor may be utterly unable to pay anything like the
amount of the damage sustained entirely from the wrongful act of
the defendant; and it would seem unjust, and contrary to the general
principles of law, if such wrong-doer were not responsible for the
damage caused by his wrongful and malicious act. Several of the
cases cited by Mr. <em>Cowling</em> on this part of the case seem well worthy
of attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without however deciding any such more general question, I think
that we are justified in applying the principle of the action for enticing
away servants to a case where the defendant <em>maliciously procures</em> a
party, who is under a valid contract to give her exclusive personal
services to the plaintiff for a specified period, to refuse to give such
services <em>during the period for which she had so contracted</em>, whereby
the plaintiff was injured.</p>

<p class='c007'>I think, therefore, that our judgment should be for the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Erle, J.</span> The question raised upon this demurrer is, Whether an
action will lie by the proprietor of a theatre against a person who
maliciously procures an entire abandonment of a contract to perform
exclusively at that theatre for a certain time; whereby damage was
sustained? And it seems to me that it will. The authorities are
numerous and uniform, that an action will lie by a master against a
person who procures that a servant should unlawfully leave his service.
The principle involved in these cases comprises the present; for
there, the right of action in the master arises from the wrongful act
of the defendant in procuring that the person hired should break his
contract, by putting an end to the relation of employer and employed;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_878'>878</span>and the present case is the same. If it is objected that this class of
actions for procuring a breach of contract of hiring rests upon no
principle, and ought not to be extended beyond the cases heretofore
decided, and that, as those have related to contracts respecting trade,
manufactures, or household service, and not to performance at a
theatre, therefore they are no authority for an action in respect of a
contract for such performance; the answer appears to me to be, that
the class of cases referred to rests upon the principle that the procurement
of the violation of the right is a cause of action, and that, when
this principle is applied to a violation of a right arising upon a contract
of hiring, the nature of the service contracted for is immaterial.
It is clear that the procurement of the violation of a right is a cause
of action in all instances where the violation is an actionable wrong,
as in violations of a right to property, whether real or personal, or to
personal security; he who procures the wrong is a joint wrong-doer,
and may be sued, either alone or jointly with the agent, in the appropriate
action for the wrong complained of. Where a right to the performance
of a contract has been violated by a breach thereof, the
remedy is upon the contract against the contracting party; and, if
he is made to indemnify for such breach, no further recourse is allowed;
and, as in case of the procurement of a breach of contract the
action is for a wrong and cannot be joined with the action on the contract,
and as the act itself is not likely to be of frequent occurrence
nor easy of proof, therefore the actions for this wrong, in respect of
other contracts than those of hiring, are not numerous; but still they
seem to me sufficient to show that the principle has been recognized.
In Winsmore <em>v.</em> Greenbank it was decided that the procuring of a
breach of the contract of a wife is a cause of action. The only distinction
in principle between this case and other cases of contracts is,
that the wife is not liable to be sued; but the judgment rests on no
such grounds; the procuring a violation of the plaintiff’s right under
the marriage contract is held to be an actionable wrong. In Green <em>v.</em>
Button, 2 C. M. &amp; R. 707, it was decided that the procuring a breach
of a contract of sale of goods by a false claim of lien is an actionable
wrong. Sheperd <em>v.</em> Wakeman, 1 Sid. 79, is to the same effect, where
the defendant procured a breach of a contract of marriage by asserting
that the woman was already married. In Ashley <em>v.</em> Harrison, 1
Peake’s N. P. C. 194; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span> 1 Esp. N. P. C. 48, and in Taylor <em>v.</em> Neri,
1 Esp. N. P. C. 386, it was properly decided that the action did not
lie, because the battery, in the first case, and the libel, in the second
case, upon the contracting parties were not shown to be with intent
to cause those persons to break their contracts, and so the defendants
by their wrongful acts did not procure the breaches of contract which
were complained of. If they had so acted for the purpose of procuring
those breaches, it seems to me they would have been liable to the
plaintiffs. To these decisions, founded on the principle now relied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_879'>879</span>upon, the cases for procuring breaches of contracts of hiring should
be added; at least Lord Mansfield’s judgment in Bird <em>v.</em> Randall, 3
Burr. 1345, is to that effect. This principle is supported by good
reason. He who maliciously procures a damage to another by violation
of his right ought to be made to indemnify; and that, whether he
procures an actionable wrong or a breach of contract. He who procures
the non-delivery of goods according to contract may inflict an
injury, the same as he who procures the abstraction of goods after
delivery; and both ought on the same ground to be made responsible.
The remedy on the contract may be inadequate, as where the measure
of damages is restricted; or in the case of non-payment of a debt
where the damage may be bankruptcy to the creditor who is disappointed,
but the measure of damages against the debtor is interest
only; or, in the case of the non-delivery of the goods, the disappointment
may lead to a heavy forfeiture under a contract to complete a
work within a time, but the measure of damages against the vendor of
the goods for non-delivery may be only the difference between the
contract price and the market value of the goods in question at the
time of the breach. In such cases, he who procures the damage maliciously
might justly be made responsible beyond the liability of the
contractor.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the objection that the contracting party had not
begun the performance of the contract, I do not think it a tenable
ground of defence. The procurement of the breach of the contract
may be equally injurious, whether the service has begun or not, and
in my judgment ought to be equally actionable, as the relation of
employer and employed is constituted by the contract alone, and no
act of service is necessary thereto.</p>

<p class='c007'>The result is that there ought to be, in my opinion, judgment for
the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The concurring opinion of <span class='sc'>Wightman, J.</span>, is omitted.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Coleridge, J.</span> It may simplify what I have to say, if I first state
what are the conclusions which I seek to establish. They are these:
that in respect of breach of contract the general rule of our law is to
confine its remedies by action to the contracting parties, and to damages
directly and proximately consequential on the act of him who is
sued;<a id='r572'></a><a href='#f572' class='c015'><sup>[572]</sup></a> that, as between master and servant, there is an admitted
exception; that this exception dates from the Statute of Laborers, 23
Edw. III., and both on principle and according to authority is limited
by it. If I am right in these positions, the conclusion will be for the
defendant, because enough appears on this record to show, as to the
first, that he, and, as to the second, that Johanna Wagner, is not
within the limits so drawn.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_880'>880</span>First, then, that the remedy for breach of contract is by the general
rule of our law confined to the contracting parties. I need not argue
that, if there be any remedy by action against a stranger, it must be by
action on the case. Now, to found this, there must be both injury in
the strict sense of the word (that is a wrong done), and loss resulting
from that injury: the injury or wrong done must be the act of the
defendant; and the loss must be a direct and natural, not a remote and
indirect consequence of the defendant’s act. Unless there be a loss
thus directly and proximately connected with the act, the mere intention,
or even the endeavor, to produce it will not found the action.
The existence of the intention, that is the malice, will in some cases be
an essential ingredient in order to constitute the wrongfulness or injurious
nature of the act; but it will neither supply the want of the
act itself, or its hurtful consequences: however complete the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">injuria</span></i>,
and whether with malice or without, if the act be after all <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine damno</span></i>,
no action on the case will lie. The distinction between civil and
criminal proceedings in this respect is clear and material; and a
recollection of the different objects of the two will dispose of any
argument founded merely on the allegation of malice in this declaration,
if I shall be found right in thinking that the defendant’s act has
not been the direct or proximate cause of the damage which the plaintiff
alleges he has sustained. If a contract has been made between A.
and B. that the latter should go supercargo for the former on a voyage
to China, and C., however maliciously, persuades B. to break his
contract, but in vain, no one, I suppose, would contend that any action
would lie against C. On the other hand, suppose a contract of the
same kind made between the same parties to go to Sierra Leone, and
C. urgently and <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> advises B. to abandon his contract, which
on consideration B. does, whereby loss results to A.; I think no one
will be found bold enough to maintain that an action would lie against
C. In the first case no loss has resulted; the malice has been ineffectual;
in the second, though a loss has resulted from the act, that
act was not C.’s, but entirely and exclusively B.’s own. If so, let
malice be added, and let C. have persuaded, not <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> but <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mala fide</span></i>
and maliciously, still, all other circumstances remaining the same, the
same reason applies; for it is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">malitia sine damno</span></i>, if the hurtful act is
entirely and exclusively B.’s, which last circumstance cannot be affected
by the presence or absence of malice in C. Thus far I do not
apprehend much difference of opinion: there would be such a manifest
absurdity in attempting to trace up the act of a free agent breaking
a contract to all the advisers who may have influenced his mind,
more or less honestly, more or less powerfully, and to make them responsible
civilly for the consequences of what after all is his own act,
and for the whole of the hurtful consequences of which the law makes
him directly and fully responsible, that I believe it will never be contended
for seriously. This was the principle on which Lord Kenyon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_881'>881</span>proceeded in Ashley <em>v.</em> Harrison, 1 Peake’s N. P. C. 194; <span class='fss'>S. C.</span> 1 Esp.
N. P. C. 48. There the defendant libelled Madame Mara; the plaintiff
alleged that, in consequence, she, from apprehension of being hissed
and ill-treated, forbore to sing for him, though engaged, whereby he
lost great profits. Lord Kenyon nonsuited the plaintiff: he thought
the defendant’s act too remote from the damage assigned. But it will
be said that this declaration charges more than is stated in the case
last supposed, because it alleges, not merely a persuasion or enticement,
but a procuring. In Winsmore <em>v.</em> Greenbank the same word was
used in the first count of the declaration, which alone is material to
the present case; and the Chief Justice, who relied on it, and distinguished
it from enticing, defined it to mean “persuading with effect;”
and he held that the husband might sue a stranger for persuading with
effect his wife to do a wrongful act directly hurtful to himself. Although
I should hesitate to be bound by every word of the judgment,
yet I am not called on to question this definition or the decision of the
case. Persuading with effect, or effectually or successfully persuading,
may no doubt sometimes be actionable—as in trespass—even
where it is used towards a free agent; the maxims, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui facit per alium
facit per se</span></i>, and <em>respondeat superior</em>, are unquestionable; but, where
they apply, the wrongful act done is properly charged to be the act of
him who has procured it to be done. He is sued as a principal trespasser,
and the damage, if proved, flows directly and immediately
from his act, though it was the hand of another, and he a free agent,
that was employed. But, when you apply the term of effectual persuasion
to the breach of a contract, it has obviously a different meaning;
the persuader has not broken and could not break the contract,
for he had never entered into any; he cannot be sued upon the contract;
and yet it is the breach of the contract only that is the cause of
damage: Neither can it be said that in breaking the contract the contractor
is the agent of him who procures him to do so; it is still his
own act; he is principal in so doing, and is the only principal. This
answer may seem technical; but it really goes to the root of the matter.
It shows that the procurer has not done the hurtful act; what
he has done is too remote from the damage to make him answerable
for it. The case itself of Winsmore <em>v.</em> Greenbank seems to me to have
little or no bearing on the present: a wife is not, as regards her husband,
a free agent or separate person; if to be considered so for the
present purpose, she is rather in the character of a servant, with this
important peculiarity, that, if she be induced to withdraw from his
society and cohabit with another or do him any wrong, no action is
maintainable by him against her. In the case of criminal conversation,
trespass lies against the adulterer as for an assault on her, however
she may in fact have been a willing party to all that the defendant
had done. No doubt, therefore, effectual persuasion to the wife to
withdraw and conceal herself from her husband is in the eye of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_882'>882</span>law an actual withdrawing and concealing her; and so, in other counts
of the declaration, was it charged in this very case of Winsmore <em>v.</em>
Greenbank. A case explainable and explained on the same principle
is that of ravishment of ward. The writ for this lay against one who
procured a man’s ward to depart from him; and, where this was urged
in a case hereafter to be cited (Mich. 11 H. 4, fol. 23 A. pl., 46, 2 E.
&amp; B. 255), Judge Hankford<a id='r573'></a><a href='#f573' class='c015'><sup>[573]</sup></a> gives the answer: the reason is, he says,
because the ward is a chattel, and vests in him who has the right.
None of this reasoning applies to the case of a breach of contract; if
it does, I should be glad to know how any treatise on the law of contract
could be complete without a chapter on this head, or how it
happens that we have no decisions upon it. Certainly no subject could
well be more fruitful or important; important contracts are more
commonly broken with than without persuaders or procurers, and
these often responsible persons when the principals may not be so. I
am aware that with respect to an action on the case the argument
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ impressionis</span></i> is sometimes of no weight. If the circumstances
under which the action would be brought have not before arisen, or
are of rare occurrence, it will be of none, or only of inconsiderable
weight; but, if the circumstances have been common, if there has
been frequently occasion for the action, I apprehend it <em>is</em> important to
find that the action has yet never been tried. Now we find a plentiful
supply both of text and decision in the case of seduction of servants;
and what inference does this lead to, contrasted with the silence of the
books and the absence of decisions on the case of breach of ordinary
contracts? Let this too be considered: that, if by the common law it
was actionable effectually to persuade another to break his contract to
the damage of the contractor, it would seem on principle to be equally
so to uphold him, after the breach, in continuing it. Now upon this
the two conflicting cases of Adams <em>v.</em> Bafeald, 1 Leon. 240, and Blake
<em>v.</em> Lanyon, 6 T. R. 221, are worth considering. In the first, two
judges against one decided that an action does not lie for retaining
the servant of another, unless the defendant has first procured the
servant to leave his master; in the second, this was overruled; and,
although it was taken as a fact that the defendant had hired the servant
in ignorance and, as soon as he knew that he had left his former
master with work unfinished, requested him to return, which we must
understand to have been a real, earnest request, and only continued
him after his refusal, which we must take to have been his independent
refusal, it was held that the action lay; and this reason is given:
“The very act of giving him employment is affording him the means
of keeping out of his former service.” Would the judges who laid
this down have held it actionable to give a stray servant food or clothing
or lodging out of charity? Yet these would have been equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_883'>883</span>means of keeping him out of his former service. The true ground on
which this action was maintainable, if at all, was the Statute of
Laborers, to which no reference was made. But I mention this case
now as showing how far courts of justice may be led if they allow
themselves, in the pursuit of perfectly complete remedies for all
wrongful acts, to transgress the bounds which our law, in a wise
consciousness as I conceive of its limited powers, has imposed on itself,
of redressing only the proximate and direct consequences of wrongful
acts. To draw a line between advice, persuasion, enticement and procurement
is practically impossible in a court of justice; who shall say
how much of a free agent’s resolution flows from the interference of
other minds, or the independent resolution of his own? This is a matter
for the casuist rather than the jurist; still less is it for the juryman.
Again, why draw the line between bad and good faith? If
advice given <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mala fide</span></i>, and loss sustained, entitle me to damages, why,
though the advice be given honestly, but under wrong information,
with a loss sustained, am I not entitled to them? According to all
legal analogies the <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fides</span></i> of him who, by a conscious wilful act,
directly injures me will not relieve him from the obligation to compensate
me in damages for my loss. Again, where several persons
happen to persuade to the same effect, and in the result the party
persuaded acts upon the advice, how is it to be determined against
whom the action may be brought, whether they are to be sued jointly
or severally, in what proportions damages are to be recovered? Again,
if, instead of limiting our recourse to the agent, actual or constructive,
we will go back to the person who immediately persuades or procures
him one step, why are we stop there? The first mover, and the
malicious mover too, may be removed several steps backward from
the party actually induced to break the contract; why are we not to
trace him out? Morally he may be the most guilty. I adopt the
arguments of Lord Abinger and my brother Alderson in the case of
Winterbottom <em>v.</em> Wright, 10 M. &amp; W. 109; if we go the first step, we
can show no good reason for not going fifty. And, again, I ask how
is it that, if the law really be as the plaintiff contends, we have no
discussions upon such questions as these in our books, no decisions in
our reports? Surely such cases would not have been of rare occurrence;
they are not of slight importance, and could hardly have been
decided without reference to the Courts in Banc. Not one was cited in
the argument bearing closely enough upon this point to warrant me in
any further detailed examination of them. I conclude therefore what
occurs to me on the first proposition on which the plaintiff’s case rests.</p>

I am about to read, and it is to be taken therefore as the judgment
of the Lord Chancellor as well as of myself.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this case, we were of opinion at the hearing, that the contract
was one for personal service, though not one which established strictly
for all purposes the relation of master and servant between the plaintiff
and Pearson. We were of opinion that there was evidence to
justify a finding that Pearson had been induced by the defendants to
break his contract of service, that he had broken it, and had thereby,
in fact, caused some injury to the plaintiff. We were of opinion that
the act of the defendants was done with knowledge of the contract
between the plaintiff and Pearson, was done in order to obtain an
advantage for one of the defendants at the expense of the plaintiff,
was done from a wrong motive, and would therefore justify a finding
that it was done in that sense maliciously. There remained nevertheless
the question, whether there was any evidence to be left to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_885'>885</span>jury against the defendants Hall and Fletcher, it being objected that
Pearson was not a servant of the plaintiff. The case was accurately
within the authority of the case of Lumley <em>v.</em> Gye. If that case was
rightly decided, the objection in this case failed. The only question
then which we took time to consider was whether the decision of the
majority of the judges in that case should be supported in a Court of
Error. That case was so elaborately discussed by the learned judges
who took part in it, that little more can be said about it, than whether,
after careful consideration, one agrees rather with the judgments of
the majority, or with the most careful, learned, and able judgment of
Mr. Justice Coleridge. The decision of the majority will be seen, on a
careful consideration of their judgments, to have been founded upon
two chains of reasoning. First, that wherever a man does an act which
in law and in fact is a wrongful act, and such an act as may, as a
natural and probable consequence of it, produce injury to another, and
which in the particular case does produce such an injury, an action
on the case will lie. This is the proposition to be deduced from the
case of Ashby <em>v.</em> White, 1 Sm. L. C. (8th ed.), p. 264. If these conditions
are satisfied, the action does not the less lie because the natural
and probable consequence of the act complained of is an act done by a
third person: or because such act so done by the third person is a
breach of duty or contract by him or an act illegal on his part, or an
act otherwise imposing an actionable liability on him. It has been
said that the law implies that the act of the third party, being one
which he has free will and power to do or not to do, is his own wilful
act, and therefore is not the natural or probable result of the defendants’
act. In many cases that may be so, but if the law is so to imply
in every case, it will be an implication contrary to manifest truth and
fact. It has been said that if the act of the third person is a breach
of duty or contract by him, or is an act which it is illegal for him to
do, the law will not recognize that it is a natural or probable consequence
of the defendant’s act. Again, if that were so held in all cases,
the law would in some refuse to recognize what is manifestly true in
fact. If the judgment of Lord Ellenborough in Vicars <em>v.</em> Wilcocks,
8 East, 1, requires this doctrine for its support, it is in our opinion
wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are of opinion that the propositions deduced above from Ashby
<em>v.</em> White, 1 Sm. L. C. (8th ed.), p. 264, are correct. If they be applied
to such a case as Lumley <em>v.</em> Gye, the question is whether all the
conditions are by such a case fulfilled. The first is that the act of the
defendants which is complained of must be an act wrongful in law
and in fact. Merely to persuade a person to break his contract, may
not be wrongful in law or fact as in the second case put by Coleridge,
J., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>. But if the persuasion be used for the indirect purpose of
injuring the plaintiff, or of benefiting the defendant at the expense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_886'>886</span>of the plaintiff, it is a malicious act which is in law and in fact a
wrong act, and therefore a wrongful act, and therefore an actionable
act if injury ensues from it. We think that it cannot be doubted that
a malicious act, such as is above described, is a wrongful act in law
and in fact. The act complained of in such a case as Lumley <em>v.</em> Gye,
and which is complained of in the present case, is therefore, because
malicious, wrongful. That act is a persuasion by the defendant of a
third person to break a contract existing between such third person
and the plaintiff. It cannot be maintained that it is not a natural
and probable consequence of that act of persuasion that the third
person will break his contract. It is not only the natural and probable
consequence, but by the terms of the proposition which involves the
success of the persuasion, it is the actual consequence. Unless there
be some technical doctrine to oblige one to say so, it seems impossible
to say correctly, in point of fact, that the breach of contract is too
remote a consequence of the act of the defendants. The technical
objections alluded to above have been suggested as the consequences
of the judgment in Vicars <em>v.</em> Wilcocks, 8 East, 1. But that judgment
when so used or relied on seems to us to be disapproved in the opinions
given in the House of Lords in Lynch <em>v.</em> Knight, 9 H. L. C. 577, and
seems to us when so used to be unreasonable. In the case of Lumley <em>v.</em>
Gye, and in the present case, the third condition is fulfilled, namely,
that the act of the defendant caused an injury to the plaintiff, unless
again it can be said correctly that the injury is too remote from the
cause. But that raises again the same question as has been just dismissed.
It is not too remote if the injury is the natural and probable
consequence of the alleged cause. That is stated in all the opinions in
Lynch <em>v.</em> Knight, 9 H. L. C. 577. The injury is in such a case in law as
well as in fact a natural and probable consequence of the cause, because
it is in fact the consequence of the cause, and there is no technical
rule against the truth being recognized. It follows that in Lumley
<em>v.</em> Gye, and in the present case, all the conditions necessary to maintain
an action on the case are fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another chain of reasoning was relied on by the majority in Lumley
<em>v.</em> Gye, and powerfully combated by Coleridge, J. It was said that
the contract in question was within the principle of the Statute of
Laborers, that is to say, that the same evil was produced by the same
means, and that as the statute made such means when employed in the
case of master and servant, strictly so called, wrongful, the common
law ought to treat similar means employed with regard to parties
standing in a similar relation as also wrongful. If, in order to support
Lumley <em>v.</em> Gye, it had been necessary to adopt this proposition
we should have much doubted, to say the least. The reasoning of
Coleridge, J., upon the second head of his judgment seems to us to be
as nearly as possible, if not quite, conclusive. But we think it is not
necessary to base the support of the case upon this latter proposition.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_887'>887</span>We think the case is better supported upon the first and larger doctrine.
And we are therefore of opinion that the judgment of the
Queen’s Bench Division was correct, and that the principal appeal
must be dismissed.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>GLAMORGAN COAL CO., LIMITED <em>v.</em> SOUTH WALES MINERS’ FEDERATION<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Court of Appeal, August 11, 1903.</span><br /> <em>Reported in [1903] 2 King’s Bench, 545.</em><br /> <br /> SOUTH WALES MINERS’ FEDERATION <em>v.</em> GLAMORGAN COAL CO., LIMITED<br /> <span class='sc'>In the House of Lords, April 14, 1905.</span><br /> <em>Reported in [1905] Appeal Cases, 239.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Appeal by the plaintiffs from the decision of <span class='sc'>Bigham, J.</span>, [1903]
1 K. B. 118.<a id='r577'></a><a href='#f577' class='c015'><sup>[577]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The action was brought by the Glamorgan Coal Company, Limited,
and seventy-three other plaintiffs, owners of collieries in South Wales,
against the South Wales Miners’ Federation, its trustees, its officers,
and a number of members of its executive council, claiming damages
for wrongfully and maliciously procuring and inducing workmen employed
in the plaintiffs’ collieries to break their contracts of service
with the plaintiffs. In the alternative the plaintiffs sued the defendants
for wrongfully, unlawfully, and maliciously conspiring together
to do the acts complained of. The plaintiffs claimed both damages
and an injunction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defence consisted of denials of the material allegations in the
statement of claim, and of a plea that the acts complained of were
done, if at all, with reasonable justification and excuse. The trial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_888'>888</span>of the action was commenced with a special jury; but ultimately the
jury was discharged, and all questions of law and fact, as well as the
ascertainment of damages, if any, were by consent left to the determination
of the learned judge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following facts (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>) were stated, in substance, by <span class='sc'>Bigham,
J.</span>, in his written opinion:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiffs are seventy-four limited liability companies associated
together for the protection of their own interests under the style
of the Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners’ Association.
They work upwards of 200 collieries in the South Wales district, and
in these collieries they employ about 100,000 men.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the last twenty or twenty-five years the masters and the men
in the South Wales colliery district have worked together under an
agreement, called the sliding scale agreement, by which the rate of
wages paid to the men is made to depend on the price for the time
being of a certain agreed class of coal—that is to say, as the price of
that coal rises or falls so the rate of wages moves up or down. Clause
23 of the sliding scale agreement is as follows: “It is hereby agreed
that all notices to terminate contracts on the part of the employers as
well as employed, shall be given only on the first day of any calendar
month, and to terminate on the last day of the same month.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant federation was formed in 1898, and in 1899 was
registered under the Friendly Societies Act. Practically all the miners
in the South Wales district became members of it. There are about
128,000 members; including all, or very nearly all, the men who work
for the plaintiffs. In 1900 the federation was in the possession of
funds amounting to 100,000<em>l.</em> By its rules its objects are declared to
be to provide funds to carry on the business of the federation; taking
into consideration the question of trade and wages; to protect workmen
generally, and regulate the relations between them and employers;
and to call conferences to deal with questions affecting the
workmen of a trade, wage, and legislative character.</p>

<p class='c007'>In November, 1900, the executive council of the federation requested
the workmen to hold meetings for the purpose of electing
delegates to attend a conference on November 12. Delegates were
accordingly elected, and at the conference a resolution was passed
authorizing the council of the federation to declare a general holiday
at any time they might think it necessary for the protection of wages
and of the industry generally.</p>

<p class='c007'>On October 23, 1901, a “manifesto” to the workmen was published,
stating that it had been resolved that the workmen shall observe as
general holidays Friday and Saturday next. Subsequently two other
stop-days were ordered, viz.: for October 31 and November 6. (The
reasons for issuing the manifesto are stated in the opinion of <span class='sc'>Stirling,
L. J.</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post.</span></i>) The result was that the men stayed away from
work on the four days, and so broke their contracts with the masters.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_889'>889</span>The manifesto purported to be issued by the sliding scale committee,
and was signed by the members of that committee, who were
also members of the executive council of the federation. But in fact
the issuing of the manifesto was caused by the executive council of the
federation. In truth it was the federation who were acting; the name
of the sliding scale committee being used as a blind, with the purpose
of securing the funds of the federation from possible liability under
the decision in the Taff Vale Case, [1901] App. Cas. 426.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bigham, J.</span>, concluded his findings of fact with the following
statement:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The evidence satisfies me that the action of the federation, and of
the other defendants in 1901, was dictated by an honest desire to forward
the interest of the workmen, and was not, in any sense, prompted
by a wish to injure the masters. Neither the federation nor the other
defendants had any prospect of personal gain from the operation of
the stop-days. Having been requested by the men by the resolution
of November 12, 1900, to advise and direct them as to when to stop
work, the federation and the other defendants, who were its officers,
in my opinion, did to the best of their ability advise and direct the
men. Whether they advised them wisely I cannot say, though I am
inclined to think not. But I am satisfied that they advised them
honestly, and without malice of any kind against the plaintiffs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have to decide, in these circumstances, whether an action in tort
will lie against the defendants. The advice and guidance of the defendants
was solicited and given. If followed, it involved, as the
defendants knew, the breaking of the subsisting contracts. It was
followed, as the defendants wished it should be, and damage resulted
to the masters; but there was no malicious intention to cause injury,
no profit was gained for themselves by the defendants, and their sole
object was to benefit the men whom they were advising and directing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned judge gave judgment for the defendants on both
branches of the plaintiffs’ claim. His opinion is reported in [1903]
1 K. B. 118.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plaintiffs appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The opinion of <span class='sc'>Vaughan Williams, L. J.</span>, in favor of affirmance,
is omitted.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Romer, L. J.</span> The law applicable to this case is, I think, well
settled. I need only refer to two passages in which that law is shortly
and comprehensively stated. In Quinn <em>v.</em> Leathem [1901], A. C. 495,
at p. 510, Lord Macnaghten said: “A violation of legal right committed
knowingly is a cause of action, and it is a violation of legal
right to interfere with contractual relations recognized by law if there
be no sufficient justification for the interference.” And in Mogul
Steamship Co. <em>v.</em> McGregor, Gow &amp; Co., 23 Q. B. D. 598, at p. 614,
Bowen, L. J., included in what is forbidden “the intentional procurement
of a violation of individual rights, contractual or other, assuming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_890'>890</span>always that there is no just cause for it.” But although, in my
judgment, there is no doubt as to the law, yet I fully recognize that
considerable difficulties may arise in applying it to the circumstances
of any particular case. When a person has knowingly procured another
to break his contract, it may be difficult under the circumstances
to say whether or not there was “sufficient justification or just cause”
for his act. I think it would be extremely difficult, even if it were
possible, to give a complete and satisfactory definition of what is
“sufficient justification,” and most attempts to do so would probably
be mischievous. I certainly shall not make the attempt. In particular
I do not think it necessary or useful to discuss the point as to how
far the question of justification can be assimilated to the question of
malice in cases of libel and slander. As Collins, M. R., said in Read
<em>v.</em> Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons, [1902] 2 K. B. 732, at
p. 739: “It is not at all necessary in this case to embark upon the
question whether ‘without just cause’ is a complete equivalent for
what was meant in the common law by ‘malice.’ I am inclined to
think that, though in many cases adequate as a description, it is not
co-extensive with it, nor do I think that in civil actions any more than
in criminal it will be possible to eliminate motives from the discussion.”
I respectfully agree with what Bowen, L. J., said in the Mogul
Case, when considering the difficulty that might arise whether there
was sufficient justification or not: “The good sense of the tribunal
which had to decide would have to analyze the circumstances and to
discover on which side of the line each case fell.” I will only add that,
in analyzing or considering the circumstances, I think that regard
might be had to the nature of the contract broken; the position of
the parties to the contract; the grounds for the breach; the means
employed to procure the breach; the relation of the person procuring
the breach to the person who breaks the contract; and I think also to
the object of the person in procuring the breach. But, though I deprecate
the attempt to define justification, I think it right to express my
opinion on certain points in connection with breaches of contract procured
where the contract is one of master and servant. In my opinion,
a defendant sued for knowingly procuring such a breach is not justified
of necessity merely by his showing that he had no personal animus
against the employer, or that it was to the advantage or interest of
both the defendant and the workman that the contract should be
broken. I take the following simple case to illustrate my view. If A.
wants to get a specially good workman, who is under contract with B.,
as A. knows, and A. gets the workman to break his contract to B.’s
injury by giving him higher wages, it would not, in my opinion, afford
A. a defence to an action against him by B. that he could establish he
had no personal animus against B., and that it was both to the interest
of himself and of the workman that the contract with B. should be
broken. I think that the principle involved in this simple case, taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_891'>891</span>by me by way of illustration, really governs the present case. For it is
to be remembered that what A. has to justify is his action, not as between
him and the workman, but as regards the employer B. And, if
I proceed to apply the law I have stated to the circumstances of the
present case, what do I find? On the findings of fact it is to my
mind clear that the defendants, the federation, procured the men to
break their contracts with the plaintiffs—so that I need not consider
how the question would have stood if what the federation had done
had been merely to advise the men, or if the men, after taking advice,
had arranged between themselves to break their contracts, and
the federation had merely notified the men’s intentions to the plaintiffs.
The federation did more than advise. They acted, and by their
agents actually procured the men to leave their work and break their
contracts. In short, it was the federation who caused the injury to
the plaintiffs. This was practically admitted before us by the counsel
for the federation, and, indeed, such an admission could not, in
my opinion, be avoided, having regard to the facts stated by the
learned judge in his judgment. And it is not disputed that the federation
acted as they did knowingly. So that the only question which
remains is one of justification. Now the justification urged is that it
was thought, and I will assume for this purpose rightly thought, to
be in the interest of the men that they should leave their work in
order to keep up the price of coal, on which the amount of wages of
the men depended. As to this, I can only say that to my mind the
ground alleged affords no justification for the conduct of the federation
towards the employers; for, as I have already pointed out, the
absence on the part of the federation of any malicious intention to
injure the employers in itself affords no sufficient justification. But
it was said that the federation had a duty towards the men which
justified them in doing what they did. For myself I cannot see that
they had any duty which in any way compelled them to act, or justified
them in acting, as they did towards the plaintiffs. And the fact
that the men and the federation, as being interested in or acting for
the benefit of the men, were both interested in keeping up prices, and
so in breaking the contracts, affords in itself no sufficient justification
for the action of the federation as against the plaintiffs, as I
have already pointed out. I think, therefore, that the appeal must
succeed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Stirling, L. J.</span></p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>That interference with contractual relations known to the law may
in some cases be justified is not, in my opinion, open to doubt. For
example, I think that a father who discovered that a child of his had
entered into an engagement to marry a person of immoral character
would not only be justified in interfering to prevent that contract from
being carried into effect, but would greatly fail in his duty to his child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_892'>892</span>if he did not. This duty is recognized by the courts; for the Court
of Chancery and the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice
have continually so interfered on behalf of wards of Court, sometimes
with a heavy hand; and the principle on which the judges of those
courts have acted is simply that of doing on behalf of the ward that
which a right-minded father would do in the true interest of his child.
I conceive that circumstances might occur which would give rise to the
same duty in the case of a contract of service. I need not say that the
present is a very different case from that which I have just put. It
would no doubt be desirable if a general rule could be formulated
which would determine in what cases such a justification exists; but
no such rule has been laid down, and I doubt whether this can be
done; so far as I can see it must be left (in the language of Lord
Bowen) to the tribunal to analyze the circumstances of each particular
case and discover whether a justification exists or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present case the learned judge finds that the federation and
the other defendants “had lawful justification or excuse for what they
did in this, that having been solicited by the men to advise and guide
them on the question of stop-days, it was their duty and right to give
them advice, and to do what might be necessary to secure that the
advice should be followed;” and the existence of this duty has been
strongly pressed upon us in argument by the learned counsel for the
several defendants. It will be observed that the learned judge expressly
finds that the defendants were not merely advisers, but also
agents “to do what might be necessary to secure that the advice
should be followed.” In the view which I take of the facts the defendants
not only gave advice, but acted, and their action took the form of
interfering with the contractual relations between the masters and the
men. If in so doing they committed a tort, it would be no answer to
say that they acted upon the advice of a third person, as, for example,
their own solicitor; and it is difficult to see how they can be in a better
position simply because the advice on which they acted emanated
from themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my judgment the liability of the defendants must turn on the
answer to be given to the question whether the circumstances of the
case were in fact such as to justify the defendants, or any of them,
in acting as they did.</p>

<p class='c007'>The circumstances were these: Middlemen at Cardiff were attempting
to reduce the price of coal, and it was feared that some employers
might yield to the pressure of competition and enter into agreements
for the sale of coal at prices lower than those existing at the time,
with the result that the wages of the miners, which were regulated
by a sliding scale, would be reduced.</p>

<p class='c007'>To counteract this it was considered desirable by the men’s advisers
that prices should be sustained by diminishing the output of coal,
and that this should be effected by the men taking the holidays complained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_893'>893</span>of. It was not contended or suggested that a limitation of
the output of coal was an illegitimate object or aim on the part of the
men, or that, if it could have been attained without the breach of
contracts (as, for example, by the service of proper notices putting an
end to those contracts), the men would not have been within their
legal rights. The difficulty which presented itself was this,—that
one of the terms of the arrangement under which the sliding scale
of wages existed was that notices of the determination of contracts
of employment should only be given on the first day of a calendar
month to terminate on the last day, and this prevented notices of determination
being effective at the desired moment. The critical period
was known to occur in October or November. The men persuaded
themselves that it was the masters’ interest as well as their own that
they should have power to take holidays at this period; but this was
a point on which the masters were entitled to have their own opinion;
and from what occurred in November, 1900, it was known to the men
that the masters’ view did not agree with that of the men. If the
men had faith in the soundness of their opinion, their course was to
negotiate through the defendants for a modification of the sliding
scale arrangement; what they actually thought fit to do was that
while insisting on the benefit of the sliding scale they treated themselves
as emancipated from the observance of one of the terms on
which that scale had been agreed to, although the masters objected,
and although the course taken by the men might result in serious
damages to the masters, or some of them. This is, I think, a difficult
position to maintain. The justification set up seems to me to amount
to no more than this—that the course which they took, although it
might be to the detriment of the masters, was for the pecuniary interest
of the men; and I think it wholly insufficient. The defendants
took active steps to carry this policy into effect, and, as I have said,
interfered to bring about the violation of legal rights. In my judgment
they fail to justify those acts, and the appeal ought to be
allowed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Court</span> declined to grant an immediate injunction, but reserved
liberty to the plaintiffs to apply for an injunction in case it should be
necessary to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants appealed to the House of Lords.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <span class='sc'>Earl of Halsbury, L. C.</span>, gave an opinion in favor of dismissing
the appeal.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Macnaghten.</span></p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>But what is the alleged justification in the present case? It was
said that the council—the executive of the federation—had a duty
cast upon them to protect the interests of the members of the union,
and that they could not be made legally responsible for the consequences
of their action if they acted honestly in good faith and without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_894'>894</span>any sinister or indirect motive. The case was argued with equal
candor and ability. But it seems to me that the argument may be
disposed of by two simple questions. How was the duty created?
What in fact was the alleged duty? The alleged duty was created
by the members of the union themselves, who elected or appointed
the officials of the union to guide and direct their action; and then it
was contended that the body to whom the members of the union have
thus committed their individual freedom of action are not responsible
for what they do if they act according to their honest judgment in
furtherance of what they consider to be the interest of their constituents.
It seems to me that if that plea were admitted there would be
an end of all responsibility. It would be idle to sue the workmen, the
individual wrong-doers, even if it were practicable to do so. Their
counsellors and protectors, the real authors of the mischief, would be
safe from legal proceedings. The only other question is, What is the
alleged duty set up by the federation? I do not think it can be better
described than it was by Mr. Lush. It comes to this—it is the duty
on all proper occasions, of which the federation or their officials are
to be the sole judges, to counsel and procure a breach of duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>I agree with Romer and Stirling, L.JJ., and I think the appeal
must be dismissed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord James.</span></p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>In order, therefore, to establish the existence of good cause and
excuse, all the defendants can say is, “We, the federation, had the
duty cast upon us to advise the workmen. We did advise them to
commit an unlawful act, but in giving that advice we honestly believed
that they would be in a better financial position than if they acted
lawfully and fulfilled their contracts.” Even if it be assumed that
such allegations are correct in fact, I think that no justification in
law is established by them. The intention of the defendants was
directly to procure the breach of contracts. The fact that their motives
were good in the interests of those they moved to action does
not form any answer to those who have suffered from the unlawful
act. During the arguments that have been addressed to your Lordships
I do not think quite sufficient distinction was drawn between
the intention and the motives of the defendants. Their intention
clearly was that the workmen should break their contracts. The
defendants’ motives, no doubt, were that by so doing wages should be
raised. But if in carrying out the intention the defendants purposely
procured an unlawful act to be committed, the wrong that is thereby
inflicted cannot be obliterated by the existence of a motive to secure
a money benefit to the wrong-doers.</p>

<p class='c007'>For these reasons I think the judgment of the Court of Appeal
should be affirmed.<a id='r578'></a><a href='#f578' class='c015'><sup>[578]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_895'>895</span><span class='sc'>Lord Lindley.</span> My Lords, I agree so entirely with the judgments
of Romer and Stirling, L.JJ., that I should say no more were it not
for the great importance of some of the arguments addressed to your
Lordships on this appeal and which deserve notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is useless to try and conceal the fact that an organized body of
men working together can produce results very different from those
which can be produced by an individual without assistance. Moreover,
laws adapted to individuals not acting in concert with others
require modification and extension if they are to be applied with
effect to large bodies of persons acting in concert. The English law
of conspiracy is based upon and is justified by this undeniable truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the possession of great power, whether by one person or by
many, is quite as consistent with its lawful as with its unlawful employment;
and there is no legal presumption that it will be or has
been unlawfully exercised in any particular case. Some illegal act
must be proved to be threatened and intended, or to have been committed,
before any court of justice in the United Kingdom can properly
make such conduct the basis of any decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>These remarks are as applicable to trade unions as to other less
powerful organizations. Their power to intimidate and coerce is undoubted;
its exercise is comparatively easy and probable; but it
would be wrong on this account to treat their conduct as illegal in any
particular case without proof of further facts which make it so. It is
not incumbent on a trade union to rebut any presumption of illegality
based only on their power to do wrong. Freedom necessarily involves
such a power; but the mere fact of its existence does not justify any
legal presumption that it will be abused.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case before your Lordships there is proof that the members
of the mining federation combined to break and did break their contracts
with their employers by stopping work without proper notice
and without proper leave. There is also proof that the officials of the
federation assisted the men to do this by ordering them to stop work
on particular days named by the officials. To break a contract is an
unlawful act, or, in the language of Lord Watson in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood,
[1898] A. C. at p. 96, “a breach of contract is in itself a legal wrong.”
The form of action for such a wrong is quite immaterial in considering
the general question of the legality or illegality of a breach of contract.
Any party to a contract can break it if he chooses; but in
point of law he is not entitled to break it even on offering to pay damages.
If he wants to entitle himself to do that he must stipulate for
an option to that effect. Non-lawyers are apt to think that everything
is lawful which is not criminally punishable; but this is an entire
misconception. A breach of contract would not be actionable if nothing
legally wrong was involved in the breach.</p>

<p class='c007'>The federation by its officials are clearly proved in this case to have
been engaged in intentionally assisting in the concerted breach of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_896'>896</span>number of contracts entered into by workmen belonging to the federation.
This is clearly unlawful, according to Lumley <em>v.</em> Gye, 2 E. &amp; B.
216, and Quinn <em>v.</em> Leathem, [1901] A. C. 495, and the more recent
case of Read <em>v.</em> Friendly Society of Stonemasons, [1902] 2 K. B. 732.
Nor is this conclusion opposed to Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, or
the Mogul Steamship Company’s Case, [1892] A. C. 25, where there
was no unlawful act committed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appellants’ counsel did not deny that, in his view of the case,
the defendants’ conduct required justification, and it was contended
(1) that all which the officials did was to advise the men, and (2)
that the officials owed a duty to the men to advise and assist them as
they did.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards advice, it is not necessary to consider when, if ever, mere
advice to do an unlawful act is actionable when the advice is not libellous
or slanderous. Nor is it necessary to consider those cases in
which a person, whose rights will be violated if a contract is performed,
is justified in endeavoring to procure a breach of such contract. Nor
is it necessary to consider what a parent or guardian may do to protect
his child or ward. That there are cases in which it is not actionable
to exhort a person to break a contract may be admitted; and it is very
difficult to draw a sharp line separating all such cases from all others.
But the so-called advice here was much more than counsel; it was
accompanied by orders to stop, which could not be disobeyed with impunity.
A refusal to stop work as ordered would have been regarded
as disloyal to the federation. This is plain from the speeches given in
evidence on the trial; and in my opinion it is a very important element
in the case which cannot be ignored.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards duty the question immediately arises—duty to do
what? The defendants have to justify a particular line of conduct,
which was wrongful, i. e., aiding and abetting the men in doing what
both the men and the officials knew was legally wrong. The constitution
of the union may have rendered it the duty of the officials to
advise the men what could be legally done to protect their own interests;
but a legal duty to do what is illegal and known so to be is a contradiction
in terms. A similar argument was urged without success in
the case of the Friendly Society of Stonemasons, [1902] 2 K. B. 732,
already referred to.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then your Lordships were invited to say that there was a moral or
social duty on the part of the officials to do what they did, and that,
as they acted <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> in the interest of the men and without any ill-will
to the employers, their conduct was justifiable; and your Lordships
were asked to treat this case as if it were like a case of libel or
slander on a privileged occasion. My Lords, this contention was not
based on authority, and its only merits are its novelty and ingenuity.
The analogy is, in my opinion, misleading, and to give effect to this
contention would be to legislate and introduce an entirely new law,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_897'>897</span>and not to expound the law as it is at present. It would be to render
many acts lawful which, as the law stands, are clearly unlawful.</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, I have purposely abstained from using the word “malice.”
Bearing in mind that malice may or may not be used to denote
ill-will, and that in legal language presumptive or implied malice is
distinguishable from express malice, it conduces to clearness in discussing
such cases as these to drop the word “malice” altogether, and to
substitute for it the meaning which is really intended to be conveyed
by it. Its use may be necessary in drawing indictments; but when all
that is meant by malice is an intention to commit an unlawful act
without reference to spite or ill-feeling, it is better to drop the word
malice and so avoid all misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>JERSEY CITY PRINTING CO. <em>v.</em> CASSIDY<br /> <span class='sc'>Court of Chancery, New Jersey, December 11, 1906.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 63 New Jersey Equity Reports, 759.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>On motion, on order to show cause, for an injunction to restrain
defendants, former employes of the complainant, and now on strike,
from unlawful interference with the complainant’s business, the employment
of workmen, &amp;c. Heard on bill, answer and affidavits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon filing the bill an order was made restraining the defendants
“from in any manner knowingly and intentionally causing or attempting
to cause by threats, offers of money, payment of money, offering to
pay or the payment of transportation expenses, inducements or persuasions
to any employe of the complainant under contract to render
service to it to break such contract by quitting such service; from any
and all personal molestation of persons willing to be employed by complainant
with intent to coerce such persons to refrain from entering
such employment; from addressing persons willing to be employed by
complainant against their will and thereby causing them personal annoyance
with a view to persuade them to refrain from such employment;
from loitering or picketing in the streets near the premises of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_898'>898</span>complainant, Nos. 68 and 70 York street, and No. 37 Montgomery
street, Jersey City, with intent to procure the personal molestation
and annoyance of persons employed or willing to be employed by complainant
and with a view to cause persons so employed to quit their employment,
or persons willing to be employed by complainant to refrain
from such employment; from entering the premises of complainant,
Nos. 68 and 70 York street, Jersey City, against its will with intent
to interfere with its business; from violence, threats of violence, insults,
indecent talk, abusive epithets practiced upon any persons without
their consent with intent to coerce them to refrain from entering
the employment of complainant, or to leave its employment.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Stevenson, V. C.</span> (orally). The bill is filed to restrain a body of
workmen, who are on a strike, and other persons associated with them,
from doing certain things which are alleged to be injurious to the
complainant, their former employer. The things that they are restrained
from doing are specified in the restraining order. That order
was not made hastily. It was formulated with care on the part of
the court, and I do not understand that counsel for the defendant
criticises its terms on the ground that they are too broad. The
defence is that the persons who are enjoined have not been doing,
and are not threatening now to do, any of those things that are
interdicted. That is the sum and substance of the defence, which
has been presented by a great many affidavits and with very great
force.</p>

<p class='c007'>The order does not interfere with the right of the workman to cease
his employment for any reasons that he deems sufficient. It does not
undertake to say that workmen may not refuse to be employed if certain
other classes of workmen are retained in employment. It leaves
the workman absolutely free to abstain from work—for good reasons,
for bad reasons, for no reasons. His absolute freedom to work, or not
to work, is not in any way impaired. The restraining order is based
upon the theory that the right of the workman to cease his employment,
to refuse to be employed, and to do that in conjunction with
his fellow-workmen, is just as absolute as is the right of the employer
to refuse further to employ one man, or ten men, or twenty men who
have theretofore been in his employment. From an examination of
the cases and a very careful consideration of the subject I am unable
to discover any right in the courts, as the law now stands, to interfere
with this absolute freedom on the part of the employer to employ
whom he will, and to cease to employ whom he will; and the corresponding
freedom on the part of the workman, for any reason or no
reason, to say that he will no longer be employed; and the further
right of the workmen, of their own free will, to combine and meet as
one party, as a unit, the employer who, on the other side of the transaction,
appears as a unit before them. Any discussion of the motives,
purposes or intentions of the employer in exercising his absolute right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_899'>899</span>to employ or not to employ as he sees fit, or of the free combination of
employes in exercising the corresponding absolute right to be employed
or not as they see fit, seems to me to be in the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, there is a wide field in which employes may combine and
exercise the arbitrary right of “dictating” to their common employer
“how he shall conduct his business.” The exact correlative of this
right of the employe exists, in an equal degree, in the employer. He
may arbitrarily “dictate” to five thousand men in his employ in regard
to matters in respect of which their conduct ought, according
to correct social and ethical principles, to be left entirely free. But if
the “dictation” is backed up solely by the announcement that, if it
is not submitted to, the dictating party will refrain from employing,
or refrain from being employed, as the case may be, no legal or
equitable right belonging to the party dictated to, which I am able to
discern, is thereby invaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the expressions which I have used, and which are commonly
used, in relation to this subject seem to me to be misleading. Union
workmen who inform their employer that they will strike if he refuses
to discharge all non-union workmen in his employ are acting within
their absolute right, and, in fact, are merely dictating the terms upon
which they will be employed. All such terms necessarily relate both
to “how the employer shall conduct his business” and how the employes
shall conduct their business.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine of the old cases, of which we have in New Jersey an
interesting example in State <em>v.</em> Donaldson, 3 Vr. 151, which placed
the employe, when acting in combination with his fellow-workmen, at
a tremendous disadvantage as compared with his employer, I think
may be regarded as entirely exploded. The authority of the deliverances
of the supreme court in State <em>v.</em> Donaldson was largely, if not
entirely, abolished by statute in 1883.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principles which I have endeavored to state are all recognized
in the restraining order in this case, and are so plainly recognized that
the intelligent and industrious counsel for the defendants is unable to
point out any respect wherein the terms of the order should be modified.
The things which the restraining order interdicts are things
which, for the purposes of this argument, it is practically conceded
the defendants have no right to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this situation of the case it would seem to be unnecessary to
further consider the legal propriety of the restraining order, much
less to take it up clause by clause. I have, however, pointed out what
conduct on the part of the defendants is excluded from the operation
of this order, and I think that it is fair to all the parties to this suit
who are concerned in the maintenance of the restraining order to explain,
at least in a general way, what conduct is included within its
prohibition. This can be most conveniently done by making plain the
most important principles embodied in the order—principles which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_900'>900</span>practically have been developed by the courts of this country and
England during the last five or ten years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The injunction in strike and boycott cases is of very recent use.
Already a wide difference of opinion has been developed among judges
in regard to the liability of a combination of workmen to actions at
law for damages and suits in equity for an injunction.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is only very recently, I think, that one of the most important
rights which now are vindicated by the injunction in a strike case has
been differentiated; in many cases it has been apparently half recognized
or indirectly enforced.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the interest of an employer or an employe in a contract for
services is property is conceded. Where defendants, in combination or
individually, undertake to interfere with and disrupt existing contract
relations between the employer and the employe, it is plain that
a property right is directly invaded. The effect is the same whether
the means employed to cause the workman to break his contract, and
thus injure the employer, are violence or threats of violence against
the employe or mere molestation, annoyance, or persuasions. In all
these cases, whatever the means may be, they constitute the cause of
the breaking of a contract, and consequently they constitute the natural
and proximate cause of damage. The intentional doing of anything
by a third party which is the natural and proximate cause of
the disruption of a contract relation, to the injury of one of the contracting
parties, is now very generally recognized as actionable, in the
absence of a sufficient justification, and the question, in every case,
seems to turn upon justification alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the tangible property of an employer is seized or directly
injured by violence, with intent to interfere with the carrying on of
his business, the case, also is free from embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of Frank <em>v.</em> Herold, 18 Dick. Ch. Rep. 443, Vice-Chancellor
Pitney amply discussed the whole subject of the unlawfulness
of molestation and annoyance of employes, with intent and with the
effect to induce them to abandon their employment, to the injury of
their employer’s business.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the difficult case presents itself when the workmen in combination
undertake to interfere with the freedom of action on the part
of other workmen who naturally would seek employment where they
(the workmen in combination) desire and intend that no man shall be
employed excepting upon their terms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulty is in perceiving how molestation and annoyance, not
of the employes of a complainant, but of persons who are merely
looking for work and may become employes of the complainant, can
be erected into a legal or equitable grievance on the part of the complainant.
But the difficulty is still further increased where the possible
employes make no complaint to any court for protection, and
the conduct of the molesting party does not afford a basis which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_901'>901</span>ancient common law recognized as sufficient to support an action of
tort on their behalf, such as for an assault and battery or a slander.
Abusive language is not necessarily actionable at the common law.
If to call a man a “scab” in the street or to follow him back and
forth from his home to his place of employment was formerly not
actionable on behalf of the victim of this petty annoyance, the problem
is to understand how one who is merely the victim’s possible employer
can complain, either at law or in equity, there being no actual contract
for service, but only a potential one, interfered with.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is easier, I think, to obtain a correct idea of the legal and equitable
right which underlies many of the injunctions which have been granted
in these strike cases restraining combinations of workmen from interfering
with the natural supply of labor to an employer, by means of
molestation and personal annoyance, if we exclude from consideration
the conduct of the defendants as a cause of action on behalf of the
immediate victims of their molestation—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, of the workman or
workmen whom the combination are seeking to deter from entering
into the employment which is offered to them, and which they, if let
alone, would wish to accept. I say this, although I firmly believe that
the molested workman, seeking employment and unreasonably interfered
with in this effort by a combination, has an action for damages
at common law, and, where the molestation is repeated and persistent,
has the same right to an injunction, in equity, which, under the same
circumstances, is accorded to his contemplated employer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The underlying right in this particular case under consideration,
which seems to be coming into general recognition as the subject of
protection by courts of equity, through the instrumentality of an injunction,
appears to be the right to enjoy a certain free and natural
condition of the labor market, which, in a recent case in the House of
Lords, was referred to, in the language of Lord Ellenborough, as a
“probable expectancy.” This underlying right has otherwise been
broadly defined or described as the right which every man has to earn
his living, or to pursue his trade or business, without undue interference,
and might otherwise be described as the right which every man
has, whether employer or employe, of absolute freedom to employ or
to be employed. The peculiar element of this perhaps newly-recognized
right is that it is an interest which one man has in the freedom of
another. In the case before this court the Jersey City Printing Company
claims the right, not only to be free in employing labor, but also
the right that labor shall be free to be employed by it, the Jersey City
Printing Company.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large part of what is most valuable in modern life seems to depend
more or less directly upon “probable expectancies.” When they
fail, civilization, as at present organized, may go down. As social and
industrial life develops and grows more complex these “probable expectancies”
are bound to increase. It would seem to be inevitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_902'>902</span>that courts of law, as our system of jurisprudence is evolved to meet
the growing wants of an increasingly complex social order, will discover,
define and protect from undue interference more of these
“probable expectancies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In undertaking to ascertain and define the rights and remedies of
employers and employes, in respect of their “probable expectancies”
in relation to the labor market, it is well not to lose sight altogether
of any other analogous rights and remedies which are based upon
similar “probable expectancies.” It will probably be found in the
end, I think, that the natural expectancy of employers in relation to
the labor market and the natural expectancy of merchants in respect
to the merchandise market must be recognized to the same extent by
courts of law and courts of equity and protected by substantially the
same rules.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is freedom in the market, freedom in the purchase and sale of all
things, including both goods and labor, that our modern law is endeavoring
to insure to every dealer on either side of the market. The
valuable thing to merchant and to customer, to employer and to employe,
manifestly is freedom on both sides of the market. The merchant,
with his fortune invested in goods and with perfect freedom to
sell, might be ruined if his customers were deprived of their freedom
to buy; the purchaser, a householder, seeking supplies for his family,
with money in his pocket and free to buy, might find his liberty of no
value and might suffer from lack of food and clothing if the shopmen
who deal in these articles were so terrorized by a powerful combination
as to be coerced into refusing to sell either food or clothing to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, however, the right of the employer and employe to a free
labor market that is the particular thing under consideration in this
case.</p>

<p class='c007'>A man establishes a large factory where working people reside, taking
the risk of his being able to conduct his industry and offer these
working people employment which they will be willing to accept. He
takes the risk of destructive competition and a large number of other
risks, out of which, at any time, may come his financial ruin and the
suspension of his manufacturing works. But our law, in its recent
development, undertakes to insure to him, not only that he may employ
whom he pleases, but that all who wish to be employed by him
may enter into and remain in such employment freely, without threats
of harm, without unreasonable molestation and annoyance from the
words, actions or other conduct of any other persons <em>acting in combination</em>.
What is the measure or test by which the conduct of a combination
of persons must be judged in order to determine whether or
not it is an unlawful interference with freedom of employment in the
labor market, and as such injurious to an employer of labor in respect
of his “probable expectancies,” has not as yet been clearly defined.
Perhaps no better definition could be suggested than that which may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_903'>903</span>be framed by conveniently using that important legal fictitious person
who has taken such a large part in the development of our law during
the last fifty years—the reasonably prudent, reasonably courageous
and not unreasonably sensitive man. Precisely this same standard is
employed throughout the law of nuisance in determining what degree
of annoyance on the part of one’s neighbor one must submit to, and
what degree of such annoyance is excessive and the subject of an action
for damages or a suit for an injunction.</p>

<p class='c007'>A man may not be liable to an action for slander for calling a workman
a “scab” in the street, but if a hundred men combine to have
this workman denounced as a “scab” in the street, or followed in the
streets to and from his home, so as to attract public attention to him
and place him in an annoyingly conspicuous position, such conduct,
the result of such combination, is held to be an invasion of the “probable
expectancy” of his employer or contemplated employer, an
invasion of this employer’s <em>right to have labor flow freely to him</em>. Without
any regard to the rights and remedies which the molested workman
may have, the injunction goes at the suit of the employer to
protect his “probable expectancy”—to secure freedom in the labor
market to employ and to be employed, upon which the continuance of
his entire industry may depend.</p>

<p class='c007'>I think it is safe to say that all through this development of strike
law, during the last decade, no principle becomes established which
does not operate equally upon both employer and employe. The rights
of both classes are absolutely equal in respect of all these “probable
expectancies.” An operator upon printing machines has the right to
offer his labor freely to any of the printing shops in Jersey City. These
shops may all combine to refuse to employ him on account of his race,
or membership in a labor union, or for any other reason, or for no
reason, precisely as twenty employes in one printing shop may combine
and arbitrarily refuse to be further employed unless the business
is conducted in accordance with their views. But in the case of the
operative seeking employment, he has a right to have the action of the
masters of the printing shops, in reference to employing him, left
absolutely free. If, after obtaining, or seeking to obtain, employment
in a shop, the master of that shop should be subjected to annoyances
and molestation, instigated by the proprietors of other printing shops,
who combine to compel by such molestation and annoyance, this one
master printer, against his will and wish, to exclude the operative from
employment, this operative, in my judgment, would have a right to
an action at law for damages, and would have a right to an injunction
if his case presented the other ordinary conditions upon which injunctions
issue. But the common law courts have not had time to speak
distinctly on this subject as yet, and it is necessary to be cautious in
dealing with a subject in which both courts of law and courts of equity
as yet are feeling their way.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_904'>904</span>I think that the leading principle enforced in the restraining order
in this case is not inconsistent with any authorities which control this
court. This principle is that a combination of employers, or a combination
of employes, the object of which is to interfere with the
freedom of the employer to employ, or of the employe to be employed
(in either of which cases there is an interference with the enjoyment
of a “probable expectancy,” which the law recognizes as something
in the nature of property), by means of such molestation or personal
annoyance as would be liable to coerce the person upon whom it was
inflicted, assuming that he is reasonably courageous and not unreasonably
sensitive, to refrain from employing or being employed, is illegal
and founds an action for damages on the part of any person knowingly
injured in respect of his “probable expectancy” by such interference,
and also, when the other necessary conditions exist, affords
the basis of an injunction from a court of equity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine which supports that portion of the restraining order
in this case which undertakes to interdict the defendants from molesting
applicants for employment as an invasion of a right of the complainant,
is applicable to a situation presenting either an employer or
an employe as complainant, and containing the following elements:</p>

<p class='c007'><em>First.</em> Some person or persons desiring to exercise the right of employing
labor, or the right of being employed to labor.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Second.</em> A combination of persons to interfere with that right,
by molestation or annoyance, of the employers who would employ,
or of the employes who would be employed, in the absence of such
molestation.</p>

<p class='c007'>How far the element of combination of a number of persons will
finally be found necessary, in order to make out the invasion of a legal
or equitable right in this class of cases, need not be discussed. We are
dealing with cases where powerful combinations of large numbers, in
fact, exist.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Third.</em> Such a degree of molestation as might constrain a person
having reasonable fortitude, and not being unreasonably sensitive, to
abandon his intention to employ or to be employed, in order to escape
such molestation.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Fourth.</em> As the result of the foregoing conditions, an actual pecuniary
loss to the complaining party, by the interference with his enjoyment
of his “probable expectancies” in respect of the labor
market.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not think that the constraining force brought to bear upon the
employer or employe which the law can interdict can ever include the
power of public opinion or even of class opinion. Every man, whether
an employer or an employe, constitutes a part of a great industrial
system, and his conduct is open to the criticism of the members of
his own class. While, therefore, a combination of union men have no
right to cry “scab” in the streets to non-union employes, or follow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_905'>905</span>them in the street in a body to and from their homes, or do many
other things <em>in combination</em>, which, if done once by a single individual,
would not found an action of tort, such combinations, I think, have
left a fairly wide field of effort towards the creation and application
of public opinion as a constraining force upon conduct of any kind
which they wish to discourage.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have endeavored to explain, in a general way, my own view of
the most important and least understood principle embodied in the
restraining order in this case, in order that the defendants, and, in
fact, all parties interested, may have all possible light in construing
and applying the exact terms of the order. What I have said may
be found to be subject to modifications, without subjecting the terms
of the order to any change. All generalizations on such a subject—such
a novel subject as the one under consideration—are dangerous.
There may be conduct on the part of a combination of employers, or
of employes, which would seem to come within the general definition
or description of illegal and prohibited conduct, which I have attempted
to frame, but which conduct, nevertheless, might be justified,
and hence could not be adjudged illegal. Molestation and personal
annoyance, however, the terms which I have employed, do not seem to
be inclusive of any justifiable conduct, especially if no one is allowed
to complain that he is molested or annoyed by being subjected peaceably
to the judgment and criticism of public opinion.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The vice-chancellor then discussed at length the effect of the answer
of the defendants and the affidavits annexed thereto, which denied all
the charges of interference with existing labor contracts or molestation
practiced to prevent new workmen from being employed. The
conclusion was that, notwithstanding such denials, even when sustained
by the greater weight of evidence, the restraining order should
be held in force as to those defendants who stood fairly charged, under
oath, with the interdicted misconduct, and should be vacated as to
any other defendants not so charged; that the sole issue appeared to
be one of fact, viz., whether the defendants had done, and were
threatening to do, the acts complained of or not, and that such an
issue could not properly be tried on <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span></i> affidavits, but should be
reserved for the final hearing; that in a case like this, where the defendants
were the only persons in sight apparently interested in having
the unlawful conduct complained of continued, and were therefore
subjected to a temptation to cause such conduct to be continued, an
injunction which merely prevented them from doing acts which they
disclaimed any right to do, and denied that they had done or threatened
to do, should be retained until the final hearing.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Bowen, L. J.</span><a id='r580'></a><a href='#f580' class='c015'><sup>[580]</sup></a> We are presented in this case with an apparent conflict
or antinomy between two rights that are equally regarded by the
law—the right of the plaintiffs to be protected in the legitimate
exercise of their trade, and the right of the defendants to carry on their
business as seems best to them, provided they commit no wrong to
others. The plaintiffs complain that the defendants have crossed the
line which the common law permits; and inasmuch as, for the purposes
of the present case, we are to assume some possible damage to the
plaintiffs, the real question to be decided is whether, on such an assumption,
the defendants in the conduct of their commercial affairs
have done anything that is unjustifiable in law. The defendants are
a number of shipowners who formed themselves into a league or conference
for the purpose of ultimately keeping in their own hands the
control of the tea carriage from certain Chinese ports, and for the
purpose of driving the plaintiffs and other competitors from the field.
In order to succeed in this object, and to discourage the plaintiffs’
vessels from resorting to those ports, the defendants during the “tea
harvest” of 1885 combined to offer to the local shippers very low
freights, with a view of generally reducing or “smashing” rates, and
thus rendering it unprofitable for the plaintiffs to send their ships
thither. They offered, moreover, a rebate of five per cent to all local
shippers and agents who would deal exclusively with vessels belonging
to the Conference, and any agent who broke the condition was to forfeit
the entire rebate on all shipments made on behalf of any and every
one of his principals during the whole year—a forfeiture of rebate or
allowance which was denominated as “penal” by the plaintiffs’ counsel.
It must, however, be taken as established that the rebate was one
which the defendants need never have allowed at all to their customers.
It must also be taken that the defendants had no personal
ill-will to the plaintiffs, nor any desire to harm them except such as is
involved in the wish and intention to discourage by such measures the
plaintiffs from sending rival vessels to such ports. The acts of which
the plaintiffs particularly complained were as follows:—First, a circular
of May 10, 1885, by which the defendants offered to the local
shippers and their agents a benefit by way of rebate if they would not
deal with the plaintiffs, which was to be lost if this condition was not
fulfilled. Secondly, the sending of special ships to Hankow in order
by competition to deprive the plaintiffs’ vessels of profitable freight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_907'>907</span>Thirdly, the offer at Hankow of freights at a level which would not
repay a shipowner for his adventure, in order to “smash” freights and
frighten the plaintiffs from the field. Fourthly, pressure put on the
defendants’ own agents to induce them to ship only by the defendants’
vessels, and not by those of the plaintiffs. It is to be observed with
regard to all these acts of which complaint is made that they were acts
that in themselves could not be said to be illegal unless made so by the
object with which, or the combination in the course of which, they
were done; and that in reality what is complained of is the pursuing
of trade competition to a length which the plaintiffs consider oppressive
and prejudicial to themselves. We were invited by the plaintiffs’
counsel to accept the position from which their argument started—that
an action will lie if a man maliciously and wrongfully conducts
himself so as to injure another in that other’s trade. Obscurity resides
in the language used to state this proposition. The terms “maliciously,”
“wrongfully,” and “injure” are words all of which have
accurate meanings, well known to the law, but which also have a popular
and less precise signification, into which it is necessary to see that
the argument does not imperceptibly slide. An intent to “injure” in
strictness means more than an intent to harm. It connotes an intent
to do wrongful harm. “Maliciously,” in like manner, means and implies
an intention to do an act which is wrongful, to the detriment of
another. The term “wrongful” imports in its turn the infringement
of some right. The ambiguous proposition to which we were invited
by the plaintiffs’ counsel still, therefore, leaves unsolved the question
of what, as between the plaintiffs and defendants, are the rights of
trade. For the purpose of clearness, I desire, as far as possible, to
avoid terms in their popular use so slippery, and to translate them into
less fallacious language wherever possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English law, which in its earlier stages began with but an imperfect
line of demarcation between torts and breaches of contract,
presents us with no scientific analysis of the degree to which the intent
to harm, or, in the language of the civil law, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">animus vicino nocendi</span></i>,
may enter into or affect the conception of a personal wrong; see
Chasemore <em>v.</em> Richards, 7 H. L. C. 349, at p. 388. All personal wrong
means the infringement of some personal right. “It is essential to an
action in tort,” say the Privy Council in Rogers <em>v.</em> Rajendro Dutt,
13 Moore, P. C. 209, “that the act complained of should under the
circumstances be legally wrongful as regards the party complaining;
that is, it must prejudicially affect him in some legal right; merely
that it will, however directly, do a man harm in his interests, is not
enough.” What, then, were the rights of the plaintiffs as traders as
against the defendants? The plaintiffs had a right to be protected
against certain kind of conduct; and we have to consider what conduct
would pass this legal line or boundary. Now, intentionally to do that
which is calculated in the ordinary course of events to damage, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_908'>908</span>which does, in fact, damage another in that other person’s property or
trade, is actionable if done without just cause or excuse. Such intentional
action when done without just cause or excuse is what the
law calls a malicious wrong (see Bromage <em>v.</em> Prosser; Capital and
Counties Bank <em>v.</em> Henty, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per</span></i> Lord Blackburn, 7 App. Cas. 741, at
p. 772). The acts of the defendants which are complained of here
were intentional, and were also calculated, no doubt, to do the plaintiffs
damage in their trade. But in order to see whether they were
wrongful we have still to discuss the question whether they were done
without any just cause or excuse. Such just cause or excuse the defendants
on their side assert to be found in their own positive right
(subject to certain limitations) to carry on their own trade freely in
the mode and manner that best suits them, and which they think best
calculated to secure their own advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>What, then, are the limitations which the law imposes on a trader in
the conduct of his business as between himself and other traders?
There seem to be no burdens or restrictions in law upon a trader which
arise merely from the fact that he is a trader, and which are not equally
laid on all other subjects of the Crown. His right to trade freely is
a right which the law recognizes and encourages, but it is one which
places him at no special disadvantage as compared with others. No
man, whether trader or not, can, however, justify damaging another in
his commercial business by fraud or misrepresentation. Intimidation,
obstruction, and molestation are forbidden; so is the intentional procurement
of a violation of individual rights, contractual or other, assuming
always that there is no just cause for it. The intentional
driving away of customers by show of violence, Tarleton <em>v.</em> M’Gawley,
Peake, 205; the obstruction of actors on the stage by preconcerted
hissing, Clifford <em>v.</em> Brandon, 2 Camp. 358, Gregory <em>v.</em> Brunswick,
13 L. J. C. P. 34; the disturbance of wild fowl in decoys by the firing
of guns, Carrington <em>v.</em> Taylor, 11 East, 571, and Keeble <em>v.</em> Hickeringill,
11 East, 574 note; the impeding or threatening servants or
workmen, Garret <em>v.</em> Taylor, Cro. Jac. 567; the inducing persons under
personal contracts to break their contracts, Bowen <em>v.</em> Hall, Lumley <em>v.</em>
Gye,—all are instances of such forbidden acts. But the defendants
have been guilty of none of these acts. They have done nothing more
against the plaintiffs than pursue to the bitter end a war of competition
waged in the interest of their own trade. To the argument that
a competition so pursued ceases to have a just cause or excuse when
there is ill-will or a personal intention to harm, it is sufficient to reply
(as I have already pointed out) that there was here no personal intention
to do any other or greater harm to the plaintiffs than such as
was necessarily involved in the desire to attract to the defendants’
ships the entire tea freights of the ports, a portion of which would
otherwise have fallen to the plaintiffs’ share. I can find no authority
for the doctrine that such a commercial motive deprives of “just cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_909'>909</span>or excuse” acts done in the course of trade which would but for such a
motive be justifiable. So to hold would be to convert into an illegal
motive the instinct of self-advancement and self-protection, which is
the very incentive to all trade. To say that a man is to trade freely,
but that he is to stop short at any act which is calculated to harm other
tradesmen, and which is designed to attract business to his own shop,
would be a strange and impossible counsel of perfection. But we were
told that competition ceases to be the lawful exercise of trade, and so
to be a lawful excuse for what will harm another, if carried to a length
which is not fair or reasonable. The offering of reduced rates by the
defendants in the present case is said to have been “unfair.” This
seems to assume that, apart from fraud, intimidation, molestation, or
obstruction, of some other personal right <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in rem</span></i> or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in personam</span></i>, there
is some natural standard of “fairness” or “reasonableness” (to be
determined by the internal consciousness of judges and juries) beyond
which competition ought not in law to go. There seems to be no
authority, and I think, with submission, that there is no sufficient
reason, for such a proposition. It would impose a novel fetter upon
trade. The defendants, we are told by the plaintiffs’ counsel, might
lawfully lower rates provided they did not lower them beyond a “fair
freight,” whatever that may mean. But where is it established that
there is any such restriction upon commerce? And what is to be
the definition of a “fair freight?” It is said that it ought to be a
normal rate of freight, such as is reasonably remunerative to the shipowner.
But over what period of time is the average of this reasonable
remunerativeness to be calculated? All commercial men with capital
are acquainted with the ordinary expedient of sowing one year a crop
of apparently unfruitful prices, in order by driving competition away
to reap a fuller harvest of profit in the future; and until the present
argument at the bar it may be doubted whether shipowners or merchants
were ever deemed to be bound by law to conform to some imaginary
“normal” standard of freights or prices, or that law courts
had a right to say to them in respect of their competitive tariffs,
“Thus far shalt thou go, and no further.” To attempt to limit English
competition in this way would probably be as hopeless an endeavor
as the experiment of King Canute. But on ordinary principles
of law no such fetter on freedom of trade can in my opinion be warranted.
A man is bound not to use his property so as to infringe upon
another’s right. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic utere tuo ut alienum non lædas.</span></i> If engaged in
actions which may involve danger to others, he ought, speaking generally,
to take reasonable care to avoid endangering them. But there
is surely no doctrine of law which compels him to use his property in a
way that judges and juries may consider reasonable: see Chasemore <em>v.</em>
Richards, 7 H. L. C. 349. If there is no such fetter upon the use of
property known to the English law, why should there be any such a
fetter upon trade?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_910'>910</span>It is urged, however, on the part of the plaintiffs, that even if the
acts complained of would not be wrongful had they been committed by
a single individual, they become actionable when they are the result of
concerted action among several. In other words, the plaintiffs, it is
contended, have been injured by an illegal conspiracy. Of the general
proposition, that certain kinds of conduct not criminal in any one individual
may become criminal if done by combination among several,
there can be no doubt. The distinction is based on sound reason, for a
combination may make oppressive or dangerous that which if it proceeded
only from a single person would be otherwise, and the very fact
of the combination may show that the object is simply to do harm,
and not to exercise one’s own just rights. In the application of this
undoubted principle it is necessary to be very careful not to press the
doctrine of illegal conspiracy beyond that which is necessary for the
protection of individuals or of the public; and it may be observed in
passing that as a rule it is the damage wrongfully done, and not the
conspiracy, that is the gist of actions on the case for conspiracy: see
Skinner <em>v.</em> Gunton, 1 Wms. Saund. 229; Hutchins <em>v.</em> Hutchins, 7 Hill,
104. But what is the definition of an illegal combination? It is an
agreement by one or more to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful
act by unlawful means: O’Connell <em>v.</em> The Queen, 11 Cl. &amp; F. 155; Reg.
<em>v.</em> Parnell, 14 Cox, Criminal Cases, 508; and the question to be solved
is whether there has been any such agreement here. Have the defendants
combined to do an unlawful act? Have they combined to
do a lawful act by unlawful means? A moment’s consideration will
be sufficient to show that this new inquiry only drives us back to the
circle of definitions and legal propositions which I have already traversed
in the previous part of this judgment. The unlawful act agreed
to, if any, between the defendants must have been the intentional
doing of some act to the detriment of the plaintiffs’ business without
just cause or excuse. Whether there was any such justification or
excuse for the defendants, is the old question over again, which, so far
as regards an individual trader, has been already solved. The only
differentia that can exist must arise, if at all, out of the fact that the
acts done are the joint acts of several capitalists, and not of one capitalist
only. The next point is whether the means adopted were unlawful.
The means adopted were competition carried to a bitter end.
Whether such means were unlawful is in like manner nothing but the
old discussion which I have gone through, and which is now revived
under a second head of inquiry, except so far as a combination of
capitalists differentiates the case of acts jointly done by them from
similar acts done by a single man of capital. But I find it impossible
myself to acquiesce in the view that the English law places any such
restriction on the combination of capital as would be involved in the
recognition of such a distinction. If so, one rich capitalist may innocently
carry competition to a length which would become unlawful in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_911'>911</span>the case of a syndicate with a joint capital no larger than his own, and
one individual merchant may lawfully do that which a firm or a partnership
may not. What limits, on such a theory, would be imposed by
law on the competitive action of a joint-stock company limited, is a
problem which might well puzzle a casuist. The truth is, that the
combination of capital for purposes of trade and competition is a very
different thing from such a combination of several persons against one,
with a view to harm him, as falls under the head of an indictable conspiracy.
There is no just cause or excuse in the latter class of cases.
There is such a just cause or excuse in the former. There are cases in
which the very fact of a combination is evidence of a design to do that
which is hurtful without just cause—is evidence—to use a technical
expression—of malice. But it is perfectly legitimate, as it seems to
me, to combine capital for all the mere purposes of trade for which capital
may, apart from combination, be legitimately used in trade. To
limit combinations of capital, when used for purposes of competition,
in the manner proposed by the argument of the plaintiffs, would, in the
present day, be impossible—would be only another method of attempting
to set boundaries to the tides. Legal puzzles which might
well distract a theorist may easily be conceived of imaginary conflicts
between the selfishness of a group of individuals and the obvious well-being
of other members of the community. Would it be an indictable
conspiracy to agree to drink up all the water from a common spring
in a time of drought; to buy up by preconcerted action all the provisions
in a market or district in times of scarcity: see Rex <em>v.</em> Waddington,
1 East, 143; to combine to purchase all the shares of a company
against a coming settling-day; or to agree to give away articles of
trade gratis in order to withdraw custom from a trader? May two
itinerant match-vendors combine to sell matches below their value in
order by competition to drive a third match-vendor from the street?
In cases like these, where the elements of intimidation, molestation, or
the other kinds of illegality to which I have alluded are not present,
the question must be decided by the application of the test I have
indicated. Assume that what is done is intentional, and that it is calculated
to do harm to others. Then comes the question, Was it done
with or without “just cause or excuse?” If it was <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> done in
the use of a man’s own property, in the exercise of a man’s own trade,
such legal justification would, I think, exist not the less because what
was done might seem to others to be selfish or unreasonable: see the
summing-up of Erle, J., and the judgment of the Queen’s Bench in
Reg. <em>v.</em> Rowlands, 17 Q. B. 671. But such legal justification would
not exist when the act was merely done with the intention of causing
temporal harm, without reference to one’s own lawful gain, or the
lawful enjoyment of one’s own rights. The good sense of the tribunal
which had to decide would have to analyze the circumstances and to
discover on which side of the line each case fell. But if the real object
<span class='pageno' id='Page_912'>912</span>were to enjoy what was one’s own, or to acquire for one’s self some
advantage in one’s property or trade, and what was done was done
honestly, peaceably, and without any of the illegal acts above referred
to, it could not, in my opinion, properly be said that it was done without
just cause or excuse. One may with advantage borrow for the
benefit of traders what was said by Erle, J., in Reg. <em>v.</em> Rowlands,
17 Q. B. 671, at p. 687, n., of workmen and of masters: “The intention
of the law is at present to allow either of them to follow the dictates
of their own will, with respect to their own actions, and their
own property; and either, I believe, has a right to study to promote
his own advantage, or to combine with others to promote their mutual
advantage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lastly, we are asked to hold the defendants’ Conference or association
illegal, as being in restraint of trade. The term “illegal” here is
a misleading one. Contracts, as they are called, in restraint of trade,
are not, in my opinion, illegal in any sense, except that the law will
not enforce them. It does not prohibit the making of such contracts;
it merely declines, after they have been made, to recognize their validity.
The law considers the disadvantage so imposed upon the contract
a sufficient shelter to the public. The language of Crompton, J., in
Hilton <em>v.</em> Eckersley, 6 E. &amp; B. 47, is, I think, not to be supported.
No action at common law will lie or ever has lain against any individual
or individuals for entering into a contract merely because it
is in restraint of trade. Lord Eldon’s equity decision in Cousins <em>v.</em>
Smith, 13 Ves. 542, is not very intelligible, even if it be not open to
the somewhat personal criticism passed on it by Lord Campbell in his
“Lives of the Chancellors.” If indeed it could be plainly proved that
the mere formation of “conferences,” “trusts,” or “associations”
such as these were always necessarily injurious to the public—a view
which involves, perhaps, the disputable assumption that, in a country
of free trade, and one which is not under the iron <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</span></i> of statutory
monopolies, such confederations can ever be really successful—and if
the evil of them were not sufficiently dealt with by the common law
rule, which held such agreements to be void as distinct from holding
them to be criminal, there might be some reason for thinking that the
common law ought to discover within its arsenal of sound commonsense
principles some further remedy commensurate with the mischief.
Neither of these assumptions are, to my mind, at all evident, nor is it
the province of judges to mould and stretch the law of conspiracy in
order to keep pace with the calculations of political economy. If
peaceable and honest combinations of capital for purposes of trade
competition are to be struck at, it must, I think, be by legislation, for
I do not see that they are under the ban of the common law.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the result, I agree with Lord Coleridge, C. J., and differ, with
regret, from the Master of the Rolls. The substance of my view is
this, that competition, however severe and egotistical, if unattended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_913'>913</span>by circumstances of dishonesty, intimidation, molestation, or such
illegalities as I have above referred to, gives rise to no cause of action
at common law. I myself should deem it to be a misfortune if we were
to attempt to prescribe to the business world how honest and peaceable
trade was to be carried on in a case where no such illegal elements
as I have mentioned exist, or were to adopt some standard of judicial
“reasonableness,” or of “normal” prices, or “fair freights,” to which
commercial adventurers, otherwise innocent, were bound to conform.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my opinion, accordingly, this appeal ought to be dismissed with
costs.</p>

<p class='c007'>In error to U. S. Circuit Court for Eastern District of Missouri.</p>

<p class='c007'>This case was determined below on a demurrer to the plaintiff’s
petition, which was sustained; and a final judgment was entered
against the Passaic Print Works, the plaintiff below, it having declined
to plead further.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff’s petition contained, in substance, the following allegations
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>):—</p>

<p class='c007'>Plaintiff is a corporation engaged in the manufacture of prints or
calicoes which it sells to jobbers or wholesale dealers in St. Louis and
elsewhere, who in turn sell the same to the retail trade. In 1899 it
had fixed on certain prices for certain specified brands of calicoes;
and it had, prior to Feb. 25, 1899, received from several wholesale
dealers in St. Louis orders for large amounts of said brands at the
prices specified. On February 25, 1899, the defendant company, combining
and conspiring among themselves and with others to the plaintiff
unknown, and maliciously intending to injure the business of the
said plaintiff, and to cause it great loss in money, and to break up and
ruin the plaintiff’s trade among the jobbers in St. Louis, maliciously
caused a circular, in the name of the said defendant corporation, to be
issued and sent out to the retail trade tributary to St. Louis. In the
circular defendant company offered for sale several brands of calicoes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_914'>914</span>manufactured by plaintiff at prices lower than those fixed by plaintiff.
The brands were offered “as long as they last” at these reduced
prices: “Prices for all items subject to change without notice, and
orders accepted only for stock on hand.” Plaintiff further alleged that
it was informed and believed that defendant had but a small quantity
of such goods to sell, and for that reason qualified its offer as above
stated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The petition further averred, that the effect of issuing this circular
was to compel jobbers to whom plaintiff had already sold either to
cancel their orders or to compel plaintiff to make a rebate on price,
and to thereby break up the trade of plaintiff in St. Louis and the
adjacent country, and to make the other jobbers in St. Louis afraid to
deal in said brands except at greatly reduced prices and then in comparatively
small quantities; and upon information and belief the
plaintiff alleged “that the quotations of this plaintiff’s said goods in
the said circular were made by the said defendants with the end and
object in this paragraph stated, and not for any legitimate trade
purpose.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Thayer</span>, Circuit Judge, [after stating the case] delivered the
opinion of the court.</p>

<p class='c007'>The complaint filed in the lower court, the substance of which has
been stated, shows by necessary intendment that when the circular of
the defendant company was issued it had in stock a limited quantity
of the four brands of calico of the plaintiff’s manufacture which are
therein described. The circular stated, in substance, that the defendant
had such calicoes in stock, and the complaint did not deny
that fact, but admitted it by averring that “the defendant corporation
had but a small quantity of such goods to sell, and for that reason
qualified its offer to sell by inserting in the circular after the name of
the goods the words ‘as long as they last.’” Moreover, the owner of
property, real or personal, has an undoubted right to sell it and to
offer it for sale at whatever price he deems proper, although the effect
of such offer may be to depreciate the market value of the commodity
which he thus offers, and incidentally to occasion loss to third parties
who have the same kind or species of property for sale. The right
to offer property for sale, and to fix the price at which it may be
bought, is incident to the ownership of property, and the loss which a
third party sustains in consequence of the exercise of that right is
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum absque injuria</span></i>. We are thus confronted with the inquiry
whether the motive which influenced the defendant company to offer
for sale such calicoes of the plaintiff’s manufacture as they had in
stock at the price named in its circular, conceding such motive to have
been as alleged in the complaint, changed the complexion of the act,
and rendered the same unlawful, when, but for the motive of the actor,
it would have been clearly lawful. It is common learning that a bad
motive—such as an intent to hinder, delay, and defraud creditors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_915'>915</span>by virtue of St. 13 Eliz. c. 5, and possibly by the rules of the common
law—will render a conveyance or transfer of property void which,
but for the bad motive, would have been valid. So, also, one who sets
the machinery of the law in motion without probable cause, and for
the sole purpose of injuring the reputation of another, or subjecting
him to loss and expense, is guilty of an unlawful act which would have
been lawful but for the improper motive. And one who, by virtue of
his situation, has a qualified privilege to make defamatory statements
concerning another, may be deprived of the benefit of that privilege
by proof that it was not exercised in good faith, but in pursuance of
a malicious intent to injure the person concerning whom the defamatory
statement or statements were made. Poll. Torts (Webb’s Ed.)
pp. 331–335, and cases there cited. There is also some authority for
saying that one who maliciously (that is, with intent to obtain some
personal benefit at another’s loss or expense) induces another to break
his contract with a third party thereby commits an actionable wrong
if special damage is disclosed, although the act done would have been
lawful if the wrongful motive had been absent. Lumley <em>v.</em> Gye, 2 El.
&amp; Bl. 216; Bowen <em>v.</em> Hall, 6 Q. B. Div. 333; Walker <em>v.</em> Cronin, 107
Mass. 555. And see Poll. Torts (Webb’s Ed.) pp. 668–673. Aside
from cases of the latter kind, it is a general rule that the bad motive
which inspires an act will not change its complexion, and render it
unlawful, if otherwise the act was done in the exercise of an undoubted
right. Or, as has sometimes been said, “when an act done is, apart
from the feelings which prompted it, legal, the civil law ought to take
no cognizance of its motive.” The question as to how far and under
what circumstances a bad purpose will render an act actionable which,
considered by itself, and without reference to the purpose which
prompted it, is lawful, has been so much discussed since the decision in
Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] 1 App. Cas. 1, that it would be profitless to indulge
in further comment. It has been well observed that it would
be dangerous to the peace of society to admit the doctrine that any
lawful act can be transformed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> into an actionable wrong
by a simple allegation that the act was inspired by malice or ill will,
or by an improper motive. It is wiser, therefore, to exclude any inquiry
into the motives of men when their actions are lawful, except in
those cases where it is well established that malice is an essential ingredient
of the cause of action, or in those cases where, the act done
being wrongful, proof of a bad motive will serve to exaggerate the
damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case at bar falls within neither of the exceptions to the general
rule above stated,—that, if an act is done in the exercise of an undoubted
right, and is lawful, the motive of the actor is immaterial.
No one can dispute the right of the defendant company to offer for
sale goods that it owned and were in its possession, whether the quantity
was great or small, for such a price as it deemed proper. This was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_916'>916</span>the outward visible act of which complaint is made, and, being lawful,
the law will not hold it to be otherwise because of a secret purpose
entertained by the defendant company to inflict loss on the
plaintiff by compelling it to reduce the cost of a certain kind of its
prints or calicoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor is the complaint aided in any respect by reference to the law
of conspiracy, since the only object that the defendants had in view
which the law will consider was the disposition or sale of certain goods
which the defendant corporation had the right to sell; and the means
employed to accomplish that end, namely, placing them on the market
at a reduced cost, were also lawful.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the brief filed in behalf of the plaintiff in error it is suggested
finally that the complaint may be sustained on the ground that it
states a good cause of action for maliciously causing certain persons
to break or cancel their contracts with the plaintiff, but we think it
quite obvious that the complaint was not framed with a view of stating
a cause of action of that nature, and that it is insufficient for that
purpose. It does not give the name of any person or corporation
with whom the plaintiff had a contract for the sale of its prints which
was subsequently broken in consequence of the wrongful acts of the
defendant. Neither does it show that it had accepted any orders for
goods which the jobber was not privileged to cancel at his pleasure.
Nor does it allege any special damage incident to the breach of any
particular contract. In view of all the allegations which the complaint
contains it is manifest, we think, that it was framed with a view of
recovering on the broad ground that the issuance of the circular was
unlawful and actionable, provided the motive of the defendant company
in issuing it was to occasion loss or inconvenience to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are of opinion that the complaint did not state a cause of action,
as the trial court held, and the judgment below is therefore
affirmed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Sanborn</span>, Circuit Judge (dissenting). I cannot concur in the
opinion of the majority in this case because the petition alleges that
the defendants by their advertisement of the goods manufactured by
plaintiff, without any legitimate trade purpose, prevented jobbers
from purchasing goods of the plaintiff, and caused those who had
agreed to purchase from it to cancel their orders unless the plaintiff
would make them a rebate, so that the plaintiff sustained damage in
the sum of $19,000. In my opinion, the gravamen of this cause of
action is not the malicious intent or purpose of the defendants, but it is
their wrongful act of interfering with the plaintiff’s business, of preventing
sales that it would have made, and of causing the cancellation
of orders to, or contracts of purchase from, the plaintiff already made.
This act, without any allegation or averment of intent or purpose, was
itself wrongful, unless it was done for a justifiable purpose. The act of
interfering with and injuring the trade or business of the plaintiff without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_917'>917</span>justifiable cause entitled the plaintiff to damages. It is conceded
that, if the defendants had advertised these prints for any legitimate
trade purpose, for the purpose of selling them for gain for themselves,
for the purpose of converting them into money because they preferred
their advertised price to the goods, or for the purpose of competing in
trade with the plaintiff, they would have had a justifiable cause for
inflicting upon it the damages of which it complains, and these damages
would then have been <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum absque injuria</span></i>. But, if they had
advertised them for any of these purposes, this case would have constituted
an exception to the general rule of law. The general rule is
that whenever one injures a man’s business, profession, or occupation
he is liable for the damages he inflicts. The exception is that, where
the injury is caused by competition in trade or the lawful exercise of a
right which the inflictor has, then the injury is justifiable, and no
damages can be recovered. But, where such an injury is inflicted,
the presumption always is that the rule, and not the exception, applies,
and, if the inflictor would justify, he must show that he falls
within the exception. The question in this case, therefore, is not
whether or not the motive or intent of the defendants will make acts
unlawful which were otherwise lawful, but whether or not the intent
and purpose of the defendants will justify an otherwise unlawful
act, and excuse them from the payment of damages for which, under
the general rule of law, they are liable to the plaintiff. It is whether
or not the petition shows that they advertised the goods for legitimate
trade purposes, so that their acts fell within the exception, which justifies
the infliction of damages, and not under the general rule, which
requires them to compensate the plaintiff for the injury they have
caused. The opinion of the majority assumes that the defendants
advertised the prints for a legitimate trade purpose, so that their acts
fell within the exception to the general rule. It overlooks the legal
presumption that injury to one’s business entitles him to compensatory
damages, and the plain averment of the petition that the acts of
the defendants were not done for any justifiable cause, but were committed
for the sole purpose of inflicting upon the plaintiff the injury
they caused.</p>

<p class='c007'>[After quoting from the averments in the petition.]</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, no one will dispute the rules of law that the plaintiff in this
action had the right to conduct its business of manufacturing and
selling prints without the injurious interference of strangers, and that
the defendants were subject to the universal rule that they must so
use their own property and rights as to inflict no unnecessary injury
upon their neighbors. The averments of this petition are that they
were not using any of their property or exercising any of their rights
for any legitimate trade purpose, but that they were using them for
the express purpose of inflicting injury upon the plaintiff, and that
they succeeded in imposing the infliction. These allegations seem to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_918'>918</span>me to bring this case under the general rule of law, and to clearly
negative the claim that it falls within the exception. They seem to
state a good cause of action.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The learned Judge here cited, and quoted from, various authorities.]</p>

<p class='c007'>The proposition is sustained by respectable authority; it is just,
and I believe it is sound,—that an action will lie for depriving a
man of custom (that is, of possible contracts), when the result is
effected by persuasion as well as when it is accomplished by fraud
or force, if the harm is inflicted without justifiable cause, such as competition
in trade. Walker <em>v.</em> Cronin, 107 Mass. 555, 565; Morasse <em>v.</em>

<p class='c007'>Under the legal principles to which reference has been made, and
under the authorities which have been cited, the petition in this case
states a good cause of action for interference with and injury to the
business of the plaintiff by preventing it from obtaining custom it
would otherwise have obtained, without any justifiable cause or excuse,
and for this reason the demurrer should have been overruled,
and the case sent to trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another reason why the judgment below should be reversed.
It is that the petition sufficiently states a cause of action for maliciously
interfering with contracts between jobbers in St. Louis and
the plaintiff, and inducing the former to break their contracts to the
injury of the latter.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>For the reasons which have now been briefly stated, the judgment
below should, in my opinion, be reversed, and the defendants should
be required to answer the petition.<a id='r583'></a><a href='#f583' class='c015'><sup>[583]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c013'>TUTTLE <em>v.</em> BUCK<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Minnesota, February 19, 1909.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 107 Minnesota Reports, 145.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Action in the District Court for Wright County to recover $10,000
damages. Defendant demurred to the complaint on the ground it did
not state a cause of action. From an order, Buckham, J., overruling
the demurrer, defendant appealed. Affirmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>This appeal was from an order overruling a general demurrer to a
complaint in which the plaintiff alleged:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_919'>919</span>That for more than ten years last past he has been and still is a
barber by trade, and engaged in business as such in the village of
Howard Lake, Minnesota, where he resides, owning and operating a
shop for the purpose of his said trade. That until the injury hereinafter
complained of his said business was prosperous, and plaintiff
was enabled thereby to comfortably maintain himself and family out
of the income and profits thereof, and also to save a considerable sum
per annum, to wit, about $800. That the defendant, during the period
of about twelve months last past, has wrongfully, unlawfully, and
maliciously endeavored to destroy plaintiff’s said business, and compel
plaintiff to abandon the same. That to that end he has persistently
and systematically sought, by false and malicious reports and accusations
of and concerning the plaintiff, by personally soliciting and
urging plaintiff’s patrons no longer to employ plaintiff, by threats of
his personal displeasure, and by various other unlawful means and
devices, to induce, and has thereby induced, many of said patrons to
withhold from plaintiff the employment by them formerly given. That
defendant is possessed of large means, and is engaged in the business
of a banker in said village of Howard Lake, at Dassel, Minnesota, and
at divers other places, and is nowise interested in the occupation of a
barber; yet in the pursuance of the wicked, malicious, and unlawful
purpose aforesaid, and for the sole and only purpose of injuring the
trade of the plaintiff, and of accomplishing his purpose and threats
of ruining the plaintiff’s said business and driving him out of said
village, the defendant fitted up and furnished a barber shop in said
village for conducting the trade of barbering. That failing to induce
any barber to occupy said shop on his own account, though offered at
nominal rental, said defendant, with the wrongful and malicious purpose
aforesaid, and not otherwise, has during the time herein stated
hired two barbers in succession for a stated salary, paid by him, to
occupy said shop, and to serve so many of plaintiff’s patrons as said
defendant has been or may be able by the means aforesaid to direct
from plaintiff’s shop. That at the present time a barber so employed
and paid by the defendant is occupying and nominally conducting the
shop thus fitted and furnished by the defendant, without paying any
rent therefor, and under an agreement with defendant whereby the income
of said shop is required to be paid to defendant, and is so paid
in partial return for his wages. That all of said things were and are
done by defendant with the sole design of injuring the plaintiff, and of
destroying his said business, and not for the purpose of serving any
legitimate interest of his own. That by reason of the great wealth and
prominence of the defendant, and the personal and financial influence
consequent thereon, he has by the means aforesaid, and through other
unlawful means and devices by him employed, materially injured the
business of the plaintiff, has largely reduced the income and profits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_920'>920</span>thereof, and intends and threatens to destroy the same altogether, to
plaintiff’s damage in the sum of $10,000.<a id='r584'></a><a href='#f584' class='c015'><sup>[584]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Elliott, J.</span> (after stating the facts as above).</p>

<p class='c007'>In has been said that the law deals only with externals, and that a
lawful act cannot be made the foundation of an action because it was
done with an evil motive. In Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, 151,
Lord Watson said that, except with regard to crimes, the law does not
take into account motives as constituting an element of civil wrong.
In Mayor <em>v.</em> Pickles, [1895] A. C. 587, Lord Halsbury stated that if
the act was lawful, “however ill the motive might be, he had a right
to do it.” In Raycroft <em>v.</em> Tayntor, 68 Vt. 219, 35 Atl. 53, 33 L. R. A.
225, 54 Am. St. 882, the court said that, “when one exercises a legal
right only, the motive which actuates him is immaterial.” In Jenkins
<em>v.</em> Fowler, 24 Pa. St. 308, Mr. Justice Black said that “malicious motives
make a bad act worse, but they cannot make that wrong which,
in its own essence, is lawful.” This language was quoted in Bohn
Mnfg. Co. <em>v.</em> Hollis, 54 Minn. 223, 233, 55 N. W. 1119, 21 L. R. A.
337, 40 Am. St. 319, and in substance in Ertz <em>v.</em> Produce Exchange,
79 Minn. 140, 143, 81 N. W. 737, 48 L. R. A. 90, 79 Am. St. 433. See
also 2 Cooley, Torts (3d Ed.) 1505; Auburn <em>v.</em> Douglass, 9 N. Y.
444.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such generalizations are of little value in determining concrete
cases. They may state the truth, but not the whole truth. Each word
and phrase used therein may require definition and limitation. Thus,
before we can apply Judge Black’s language to a particular case, we
must determine what act is “in its own essence lawful.” What did
Lord Halsbury mean by the words “lawful act”? What is meant by
“exercising a legal right”? It is not at all correct to say that the
motive with which an act is done is always immaterial, providing the
act itself is not unlawful. Numerous illustrations of the contrary will
be found in the civil as well as the criminal law.</p>

<p class='c007'>We do not intend to enter upon an elaborate discussion of the subject,
or become entangled in the subtleties connected with the words
“malice” and “malicious.” We are not able to accept without
limitations the doctrine above referred to, but at this time content
ourselves with a brief reference to some general principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be remembered that the common law is the result of growth,
and that its development has been determined by the social needs of
the community which it governs. It is the resultant of conflicting
social forces, and those forces which are for the time dominant leave
their impress upon the law. It is of judicial origin, and seeks to
establish doctrines and rules for the determination, protection, and
enforcement of legal rights. Manifestly it must change as society
changes and new rights are recognized. To be an efficient instrument,
and not a mere abstraction, it must gradually adapt itself to changed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_921'>921</span>conditions. Necessarily its form and substance have been greatly
affected by prevalent economic theories.</p>

<p class='c007'>For generations there has been a practical agreement upon the
proposition that competition in trade and business is desirable, and
this idea has found expression in the decisions of the courts as well as
in statutes. But it has led to grievous and manifold wrongs to individuals,
and many courts have manifested an earnest desire to protect
the individual from the evils which result from unrestrained business
competition. The problem has been to so adjust matters as to preserve
the principle of competition and yet guard against its abuse to
the unnecessary injury to the individual. So the principle that a man
may use his own property according to his own needs and desires,
while true in the abstract, is subject to many limitations in the concrete.
Men cannot always, in civilized society, be allowed to use their
own property as their interests or desires may dictate without reference
to the fact that they have neighbors whose rights are as sacred as
their own. The existence and well-being of society require that each
and every person shall conduct himself consistently with the fact that
he is a social and reasonable person. The purpose for which a man is
using his own property may thus sometimes determine his rights; and
applications of this idea are found in Stillwater Water Co. <em>v.</em> Farmer,
89 Minn. 58, 93 N. W. 907, 60 L. R. A. 875, 99 Am. St. 541, Id., 92
Minn. 230, 99 N. W. 882, and Barclay <em>v.</em> Abraham, 121 Iowa, 619,
96 N. W. 1080, 64 L. R. A. 255, 100 Am. St. 365.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of the restrictions which should be recognized and enforced
result from a tacit recognition of principles which are not often stated
in the decisions in express terms. Sir Frederick Pollock notes that
not many years ago it was difficult to find any definite authority for
stating as a general proposition of English law that it is wrong to do
a wilful wrong to one’s neighbor without lawful justification or excuse.
But neither is there any express authority for the general proposition
that men must perform their contracts. Both principles, in this generality
of form and conception, are modern, and there was a time when
neither was true. After developing the idea that law begins, not with
authentic general principles, but with the enumeration of particular
remedies, the learned writer continues: “If there exists, then, a positive
duty to avoid harm, much more must there exist the negative
duty of not doing wilful harm, subject, as all general duties must be
subject, to the necessary exceptions. The three main heads of duty
with which the law of torts is concerned, namely, to abstain from wilful
injury, to respect the property of others, and to use due diligence
to avoid causing harm to others, are all alike of a comprehensive nature.”
Pollock, Torts (8th Ed.), p. 21. He then quotes with approval
the statement of Lord Bowen that “at common law there was a cause
of action whenever one person did damage to another, wilfully and
intentionally, without just cause or excuse.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_922'>922</span>In Plant <em>v.</em> Woods, 176 Mass. 492, 57 N. E. 1011, 51 L. R. A. 339,
79 Am. St. 330, Mr. Justice Hammond said: “It is said also that,
where one has the lawful right to do a thing, the motive by which he is
actuated is immaterial. One form of this statement appears in the
first head-note in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, as reported in [1898] A. C. 1, as follows:
‘An act lawful in itself is not converted by a malicious or bad
motive into an unlawful act so as to make the doer of the act liable to
a civil action.’ If the meaning of this and similar expressions is that
where a person has the lawful right to do a thing irrespective of his
motive, his motive is immaterial, the proposition is a mere truism. If,
however, the meaning is that where a person, if actuated by one kind
of a motive, has a lawful right to do a thing, the act is lawful when
done under any conceivable motive, or that an act lawful under one
set of circumstances is therefore lawful under every conceivable set
of circumstances, the proposition does not commend itself to us as
either logically or legally accurate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Similar language was used by Mr. Justice Wells in Walker <em>v.</em>
Cronin, 107 Mass. 555; by Lord Coleridge in Mogul Steamship Co.
<em>v.</em> McGregor, 21 Q. B. Div. 544–553; by Lord Justice Bowen in the
same case, 23 Q. B. Div. 593; by Mr. Justice Holmes in Aikens <em>v.</em>
Wisconsin, 195 U. S. 194, 204, 25 Sup. Ct. 3, 49 L. Ed. 154; by Chief
Justice McSherry, in Klingel <em>v.</em> Sharp, 104 Md. 233, 64 Atl. 1029, 7 L.
R. A. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 976, 118 Am. St. 399; and by Judge Sanborn in his dissenting
opinion in Passaic Print Works <em>v.</em> Ely &amp; Walker Dry Goods
Co., 105 Fed. 163, 44 C. C. A. 426, 62 L. R. A. 673. Numerous cases
will be found referred to in the note to this case in 62 L. R. A. 673,
and in an article in 18 Harvard Law Rev. 411.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is freely conceded that there are many decisions contrary to this
view; but, when carried to the extent contended for by the appellant,
we think they are unsafe, unsound, and illy adapted to modern conditions.
To divert to one’s self the customers of a business rival by the
offer of goods at lower prices is in general a legitimate mode of serving
one’s own interest, and justifiable as fair competition. But when a
man starts an opposition place of business, not for the sake of profit
to himself, but regardless of loss to himself, and for the sole purpose
of driving his competitor out of business, and with the intention of
himself retiring upon the accomplishment of his malevolent purpose,
he is guilty of a wanton wrong and an actionable tort. In such a case
he would not be exercising his legal right, or doing an act which can
be judged separately from the motive which actuated him. To call
such conduct competition is a perversion of terms. It is simply the
application of force without legal justification, which in its moral
quality may be no better than highway robbery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, in the opinion of the writer this complaint is insufficient.
It is not claimed that it states a cause of action for slander.
No question of conspiracy or combination is involved. Stripped of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_923'>923</span>the adjectives and the statement that what was done was for the sole
purpose of injuring the plaintiff, and not for the purpose of serving a
legitimate purpose of the defendant, the complaint states facts which
in themselves amount only to an ordinary every day business transaction.
There is no allegation that the defendant was intentionally running
the business at a financial loss to himself, or that after driving
the plaintiff out of business the defendant closed up or intended to
close up his shop. From all that appears from the complaint he may
have opened the barber shop, energetically sought business from his
acquaintances and the customers of the plaintiff, and as a result of his
enterprise and command of capital obtained it, with the result that the
plaintiff, from want of capital, acquaintance, or enterprise, was unable
to stand the competition and was thus driven out of business.
The facts thus alleged do not, in my opinion, in themselves, without
reference to the way in which they are characterized by the pleader,
tend to show a malicious and wanton wrong to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>A majority of the justices, however, are of the opinion that, on the
principle declared in the foregoing opinion, the complaint states a
cause of action, and the order is therefore affirmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Affirmed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Jaggard, J.</span>, dissents.<a id='r585'></a><a href='#f585' class='c015'><sup>[585]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Weaver, J., in</span> DUNSHEE <em>v.</em> STANDARD OIL COMPANY<br /> (1911) <cite>152 Iowa Reports, 618.</cite></h4>

<p class='c022'>As we understand appellants’ contention, it is that their conduct did not
transgress the bounds of legitimate competition, and that so long as they
kept within this limitation the question of the alleged malice or motive inspiring
their acts is wholly immaterial. Cases involving the question thus
suggested have frequently arisen, both in this country and in England, and
there is much in harmony in the expressions of judicial opinion thereon.
Many authorities may be found holding without apparent qualification or
exception, that the law takes no account whatever of motives as constituting
an element of civil wrong. In other words, if a man do a thing which is otherwise
lawful, the fact that he does it maliciously and for the express purpose of
injuring his neighbor affords the latter no remedy at law. Such is the net
effect of Raycroft <em>v.</em> Tayntor, 68 Vt. 219, 35 Atl. 53, 33 L. R. A. 225, 54 Am.
St. Rep. 882; Jenkins <em>v.</em> Fowler, 24 Pa. 308, and others of that class. If this
be the correct view of the law, a man may excavate the earth near the boundary
of his own land for the mere purpose of seeing the foundation of the house
of his neighbor slide into the pit thus prepared for it; he may dig through his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_924'>924</span>own soil to the subterranean sources of his neighbor’s spring or well and
divert the water into a ditch, where it will serve no purpose of use or profit
to himself or any one else; if a banker or merchant, he may punish the blacksmith
who refuses to patronize him by temporarily establishing a shop on
the next lot and hiring men to shoe horses without money and without price,
until he has driven the offending smith to come to his terms or to go out of
business; and if a farmer, dependent upon a subterranean supply of water
for the irrigation of his soil or watering of his live stock, he may contrive to
ruin his competing neighbor by wasting the surplus not reasonably required
for his own use. The laws of competition in business are harsh enough at
best; but if the rule here suggested were to be carried to its logical and seemingly
unavoidable extreme there is no practical limit to the wrongs which may
be justified upon the theory that “it is business.” Fortunately, we think,
there has for many years been a distinct and growing tendency of the courts
to look beneath the letter of the law and give some effect to its beneficent
spirit, thereby preventing the perversion of the rules intended for the protection
of human rights into engines of oppression and wrong. It is doubtless
true that under many circumstances an act is legally right and defensible
without regard to the motive which induces or characterizes it; but there is
abundance of authority for saying that this is by no means the universal rule,
and that an act which is legally right when done without malice may become
legally wrong when done maliciously, wantonly, or without reasonable cause.
In Panton <em>v.</em> Holland, 17 Johns. (N. Y.) 92, 8 Am. Dec. 369, it is stated as a
general rule that, “In the exercise of a lawful right, a party may become
liable to an action where it appears that the act was done maliciously.” See
also, Greenleaf <em>v.</em> Francis, 18 Pick. (Mass.) 117; Chesley <em>v.</em> King, 74 Me. 164,
43 Am. Rep. 569; Flaherty <em>v.</em> Moran, 81 Mich. 52, 45 N. W. 381, 8 L. R. A.
183, 21 Am. St. Rep. 510; Sankey <em>v.</em> St. Marys, 8 Mont. 265, 21 Pac. 23;
Harbison <em>v.</em> White, 46 Conn. 106; Stillwater <em>v.</em> Farmer, 89 Minn. 58, 93 N. W.

applied in the decision of trade and labor controversies, though not
without other instances in which it has been repudiated. See People <em>v.</em> Petheram,
64 Mich. 252, 31 N. W. 188; Walker <em>v.</em> Cronin, 107 Mass. 555; Van
Horn <em>v.</em> Van Horn, 52 N. J. Law, 284, 20 Atl. 485, 10 L. R. A. 184; Hawarden

Van Horn Case, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, the court says: “While a trader may engage in the
sharpest competition with those in like business by holding out extraordinary
inducements,&#160;... yet, when he oversteps that line and commits an act with
the malicious intent of inflicting injury upon his rival’s business, his conduct
is illegal, and if damage results from it the injured party is entitled to redress.
Nor does it matter whether the wrong-doer effects his object by persuasion
or by false representation. The court looks through the instrumentality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_925'>925</span>or means used to the wrong perpetrated with the malicious intent and bases
the right of action on that.” Quoting this language in Barr <em>v.</em> Council, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,
the same court adds: “The right of action depends, then, not so much upon
the nature of the act, as upon the intent with which it is done, always assuming
that injury has attended the doing of it.” In Parkinson <em>v.</em> Council, 154
Cal. 581, 98 Pac. 1027, 21 L. R. A. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 550, the court, while reaching the
opposite conclusion generally, concedes it to be the law that: “Any injury to
a lawful business, whether the result of conspiracy or not, is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> actionable,
but may be defended on the ground that it was merely a lawful effort
of the defendants to promote their own welfare. To defeat this plea of justification,
the plaintiff may offer evidence that the acts of the defendants were
inspired by express malice, and were done for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff,
and not to benefit themselves.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Dealing with the perplexities arising in the effort to sustain, on the one
hand, the widest practicable liberty of men to engage in any and every line of
business, and, on the other, to protect the business of each from wrongful
encroachment or interference by others, the New Hampshire court after reference
to many of the decided cases, has lately said: “The more recent authorities
reason that, as the right to deal or not to deal with others is inherent in the
idea of Anglo-Saxon liberty, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> a man may demand an open market,
and, since this is so, one who interferes with this open market must justify his
acts, or respond in damages. Thus far these authorities are uniform, but when
they proceed to the determination of what amounts to a justification they
differ widely. The cause is not far to seek. The rule they apply is that of
reasonable conduct; yet they decide each case as though it involved only a
question of law. In reality, the issue is largely one of fact, and the result is
what would be expected. Judges are men, and their decisions upon complex
facts must vary as those of juries might on the same facts. Calling one determination
an opinion and the other a verdict does not alter human nature, nor
make that uniform and certain which from its nature must remain variable
and uncertain. While these cases go too far in what they decide as questions
of law, yet the test they constantly declare they are applying is the true one.
The standard is reasonable conduct under all the circumstances of the case.”

no definition or standard of reasonable cause can be stated which will
insure absolute uniformity or even consistency in the decision of such cases,
because the issue presented is in its essence one of fact, and the same facts and
circumstances will not always appeal with like effect to the minds of all jurors
or of all judges. It is for this reason that, save in those exceptional cases
where the case of the plaintiff or the defendant is so clear and undisputable
that all fair-minded persons are forced to the same conclusion, controversies of
this nature, in a trial at law, are for the jury, and not for the court.</p>

<p class='c019'>Coming to the case in hand, we may concede to the appellants the undoubted
right to establish a retail oil business in Des Moines, to employ agents
and drivers, and send them out over the same routes and make sales to the
same people with whom the Crystal Oil Company was dealing; but in so doing
it was bound to conduct such business with reasonable regard and consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_926'>926</span>for the equal right of the Crystal Company to continue supplying oil to
such of its customers as desired to remain with it. If, however, there was no
real purpose or desire to establish a competing business, but, under the guise
or pretence of competition, to accomplish a malicious purpose to ruin the Crystal
Company or drive it out of business, intending themselves to retire therefrom
when their end had been secured, then they can claim no immunity under
the rules of law which recognize and protect competition between dealers in
the same line of business seeking in good faith the patronage of the same
people. And if, under such pretence of competition, defendants maliciously
interfered with the business of the Crystal Oil Company, in the manner
charged, and injury to the latter was thereby inflicted, a right of action exists
for the recovery of damages. It may be conceded that authorities are not
wanting to sustain the position that, even though the Standard Oil Company
had no intention of becoming a retail dealer in oil in Des Moines, but entered
the business of selling oil in this manner temporarily, for the sole purpose of
driving the Crystal Company out, it is a matter into which the courts will not
inquire; but we think such precedents are out of harmony with fundamental
principles of justice, which, as we have said, underlie the law, as well as out
of harmony with the later and better-considered cases. True the Standard
Company, as a wholesale dealer, would violate no law in offering its product
for sale at retail at half price in the territory supplied by the Crystal Company,
but such fact, if proven, would have a distinct bearing upon the reasonableness
of its methods employed in diverting trade from said company, as well as upon
the charge that in interfering between the Crystal Company and its customers
the Standard Company was actuated by malice or spirit of wanton assault
upon the business of another, who had given it offence.<a id='r586'></a><a href='#f586' class='c015'><sup>[586]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c013'>KUZNIAK <em>v.</em> KOZMINSKI<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, Michigan, December 17, 1895.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 107 Michigan Reports, 444.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Bill by John Kuzniak against Jacob Kozminski and Frances Kozminski
to abate an alleged nuisance. From a decree for complainant,
defendants appeal. Reversed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Long, J.</span> The parties to this cause own adjoining lots in the city
of Grand Rapids. Defendants’ lot is on the southeasterly corner of
Eleventh and Muskegon streets, and upon which is a large tenement
house facing both streets. The complainant owns the lot immediately
south and adjoining the defendants’, and upon which he has a dwelling
house facing Muskegon street, and also a tenement house about
60 feet back from Muskegon street, and within 22 inches of the north
line, being the line of defendants’ lot. At the time this tenement
house was erected, defendants had upon their lot what was called a
“chicken shed”; and, after complainant’s tenement house was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_927'>927</span>erected, defendants moved this chicken shed upon a part of their lot
directly opposite complainant’s tenement house, and within 24 inches
of the lot line, and converted it into a coal and wood house for the use
of their tenants, who occupied the dwelling on said lot. This bill was
filed by complainant for the purpose of having this coal and wood
house of defendants declared a nuisance, and to compel them to remove
the same. The claim made by the bill is that the defendants
removed the building to that place through spite and from a malicious
motive, and not because it was needed for any useful purpose. Defendants
answered the bill, denying that they were actuated by malice
in putting the building there, and averred that it was so placed for the
use of their tenants for wood and coal. The testimony was taken in
open court, and the court found that the building was a nuisance, and
a decree was entered directing the defendants to remove the building
within 60 days from the date of the decree, and that, in default of
such removal, the sheriff of the county remove the same, at the cost
and expense of defendants. The complainant was awarded the costs
of the suit. Defendants appeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was held in Flaherty <em>v.</em> Moran, 81 Mich. 52, that a fence erected
maliciously, and with no other purpose than to shut out the light and
air from a neighbor’s window, was a nuisance, and the decree of the
court below ordering its removal was affirmed; but that decision was
placed on the ground that the fence served no useful purpose, and
was erected solely from a malicious motive. In the present case the
building erected by the defendants was for a useful purpose; and,
while there may have been some malice displayed in putting it so
near the complainant’s house as to shut off some of the light, that
would not be a sufficient reason upon which to found a right in complainant
to have the building removed. Defendants had a right to
erect a building upon their own premises, and the decisions have been
quite uniform to the effect that the motives of a party in doing a legal
act cannot form the basis upon which to found a remedy. In Allen <em>v.</em>
Kinyon, 41 Mich. 282, it was held that the motive is of no consequence
when the party does not violate the rights of another. In Hawkins <em>v.</em>
Sanders, 45 Mich. 491, it was held that there was no right of prospect
which would prevent the erection of an awning on a neighboring lot.
The case does not fall within the rule of Flaherty <em>v.</em> Moran, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>,
and the court below was in error in directing the removal of the building.
That decree must be reversed, and a decree entered here dismissing
complainant’s bill, with costs of both courts to the defendants.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Case, under sections 28 and 29, chapter 143, Public Statutes, for
maintaining a structure in the nature of a fence, in violation of the
statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the trial, defendant moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that
the statute is unconstitutional. The motion was denied, and defendant
excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_929'>929</span>Verdict for the plaintiff.<a id='r588'></a><a href='#f588' class='c015'><sup>[588]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Parsons, C. J.</span> “Any fence or other structure in the nature of a
fence, unnecessarily exceeding five feet in height, erected or maintained
for the purpose of annoying the owners or occupants of adjoining
property, shall be deemed a private nuisance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any owner or occupant, injured either in his comfort or the enjoyment
of his estate by such nuisance, may have an action of tort for
the damage sustained thereby.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the plaintiff recovers judgment in the action, the defendant
shall cause the removal of the nuisance within thirty days from the
date of the judgment, and for each day he shall permit the nuisance
to remain after the expiration of said thirty days he shall incur a

ss. 28, 29, 30.</p>

<p class='c007'>The act forbids the use by one landowner of his land for the unnecessary
erection of a fence exceeding five feet in height, when the
purpose of such unnecessary height is the annoyance of the adjoining
owner or occupant, if such unnecessary height injures the adjoining
owner in his comfort or the enjoyment of his estate. The claim of the
defendant in support of his motion for a nonsuit, that the statute is
unconstitutional, raises the question whether the statutory prohibition
is an interference with the defendant’s “natural, essential, and
inherent” right of “acquiring, possessing, and protecting property,”
or deprives him of that protection in its enjoyment, which is the right
of “every member of the community.” Bill of Rights, arts. 2, 12.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The constitutional objection made to the present statute raises the
question, if it appears that the statute is an interference with the defendant’s
property right, whether the interference is or not one which
the legislature might properly make as a regulation of the use of
property. The constitutionality of similar statutes has been upheld
upon the latter ground, as being merely a small limitation of existing
rights incident to property, which under the police power may be imposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_930'>930</span>for the sake of preventing a manifest evil. “It is hard,” it has
been said, “to imagine a more insignificant curtailment of the rights
of property.” Rideout <em>v.</em> Knox, 148 Mass. 368, 372, 373; Karasek <em>v.</em>
Peier, 22 Wash. 419; Western &amp;c. Co. <em>v.</em> Knickerbocker, 103 Cal.
111. Similar statutes in Maine, Vermont, and Connecticut have
been before the courts, but it has not been suggested that the power of
the legislature to adopt them has been attacked in those states. Lord
<em>v.</em> Langdon, 91 Me. 221; Harbison <em>v.</em> White, 46 Conn. 106; Gallagher
<em>v.</em> Dodge, 48 Conn. 387, 40 L. R. A. 181–183, note.</p>

<p class='c007'>The present statute was passed in 1887. Laws 1887, c. 91. In
Hunt <em>v.</em> Coggin, 66 N. H. 140, the verdict was for the defendant; and
in Horan <em>v.</em> Byrnes, 70 N. H. 531, the defendant waived any objection
to the statute upon this ground. In Lovell <em>v.</em> Noyes, 69 N. H. 263,
the question was whether a building was within the terms of the
statute. The constitutional question is now presented for the first
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is objected in answer to the argument that statutes like the present
are within the constitutional exercise of the police power, involving
for the general good some slight limitation of existing property
rights, that if one incident of the property right in real estate is the
right to use it maliciously for the sole purpose of injuring another, it
is as much an invasion of the right to take it from a small portion as
from the whole of one’s property; and that the matter in question
concerns private individuals and not the public in general, and hence
does not come within the police power. State <em>v.</em> White, 64 N. H. 48,
50. It may be thought these objections are successfully answered in
the cases cited, or that, if not there answered, a satisfactory answer
can be found. But a discussion of these objections does not reach the
fundamental question in the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The statute was designed to prevent an act the sole effect of which
would be to annoy or injure another.” Lovell <em>v.</em> Noyes, 69 N. H. 263.
The primary question, therefore, is whether one’s right to use property
solely to injure another is a part of his property right in real
estate, which is so protected by the constitution that the prohibition
of such use is not within the general power of legislation “for the
benefit and welfare of this state and for the governing and ordering
thereof.” Const. art. 5. Upon the question whether a fence on or
near the division line between adjoining landowners, maliciously built
to an unreasonable height for the sole purpose of annoying and injuring
the adjoining owner or occupant, is a nuisance which can in the
absence of statutory authority be abated by an injunction, the courts
are in conflict. Letts <em>v.</em> Kessler, 54 Ohio St. 73, answers the question
in the negative, while an opposite conclusion is reached in Michigan.
Burke <em>v.</em> Smith, 69 Mich. 380; Flaherty <em>v.</em> Moran, 81 Mich. 52;
Kirkwood <em>v.</em> Finegan, 95 Mich. 543. In Rideout <em>v.</em> Knox, 148 Mass.
368, and Karasek <em>v.</em> Peier, 22 Wash. 419, cases in which the power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_931'>931</span>the legislature to enact a statute similar to that under consideration
is attacked and upheld, it is conceded “that to a large extent the
power to use one’s property malevolently, in any way which would
be lawful for other ends, is an incident of property which cannot be
taken away even by legislation.” Rideout <em>v.</em> Knox, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, 372.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conclusion that a landowner’s property right in real estate
includes the right to use it solely for the injury and annoyance of
his neighbor, without intending to subserve any useful purpose of his
own, is “based upon a narrow view of the effect of the land titles,”
and is reached “by the strict enforcement of a technical rule of
ownership briefly expressed in an ancient maxim,” <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cujus est solum,
ejus est usque ad coelum</span></i>. The courts of this state have had in some
respects, at least, a different understanding of the elements of land-ownership.
As to the use of land in the control of surface water, the
enjoyment of water percolating beneath the surface, and the use generally
that may be rightfully made of real estate by the owner or
occupant, the test has been considered to be not merely whether the
act was an exercise of dominion on the land regardless of the injury
to other land, but the reasonableness of the use under all the circumstances,
including the necessity and advantage to one and the unavoidable
injury to the other. Franklin <em>v.</em> Durgee, 71 N. H. 186; Ladd <em>v.</em>
Brick Co., 68 N. H. 185; Swett <em>v.</em> Cutts, 50 N. H. 439; Bassett <em>v.</em>
Company, 43 N. H. 569, 577. It has been said that the rule of absolute
dominion is easier of application. Chase <em>v.</em> Silverstone, 62 Me.
175, 183. This view, however, does not seem to be upheld by the
difficulties met in its application in reference to surface waters. See
Franklin <em>v.</em> Durgee, 71 N. H. 186, 189. But however that may be,
difficulty in administration is not a sufficient reason for the denial of
justice. Cases like Chatfield <em>v.</em> Wilson, 28 Vt. 49, and Phelps <em>v.</em> Nowlen,
72 N. Y. 39, in which the principle of the maxim relied upon is
applied to waters in the soil, are not authority here, where a contrary
view is entertained. Franklin <em>v.</em> Durgee and Bassett <em>v.</em> Company,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aside from the authorities in cases in which the control of waters
was in question, the leading case appears to be Mahan <em>v.</em> Brown, 13
Wend. 261. Here, although the plaintiff alleged that the fence complained
of was erected solely to injure her, the decision is upon the
ground that by the erection of the fence the plaintiff is deprived of no
right, but is merely prevented from acquiring a right. If by enjoyment
of light and air across his neighbor’s land for the prescriptive
period a landowner could acquire a right to such enjoyment, the
building of a fence as an assertion of a contrary right and to prevent
the acquiring of such easement would be a building for a necessary
and useful purpose, and not for the sole purpose of annoying another.
The case standing upon a view of the effect of non-user of a right to
build, now generally abandoned in this country (Wash. Ease. 490,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_932'>932</span>497, 498), is not of value in the present discussion. The argument
generally is, that the motive with which one does an act otherwise
lawful is immaterial; and hence, as it must be conceded that a landowner
has the right to build on his land as he conceives may best subserve
his interests, the act lawful for a useful purpose is not made
unlawful and a nuisance merely by the intent accompanying it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether the first proposition is entirely true may perhaps be
doubted. Cases cited to support the proposition (Walker <em>v.</em> Cronin,
107 Mass. 555; Phelps <em>v.</em> Nowlen, 72 N. Y. 39) do not support it in
its entirety. See Chesley <em>v.</em> King, 74 Me. 164. In Houston <em>v.</em> Laffee,
46 N. H. 505, which was trespass for cutting an aqueduct pipe maintained
by the plaintiff upon the defendant’s land by a parol license, it
was held that if the cutting of the pipe was done simply for the purpose
of putting an end to the license, and without any malice or intentional
wrong, the defendant would not be liable; but if the pipe
was cut “wantonly, unnecessarily, maliciously, and with a view&#160;...
to injure the plaintiff,” the defendant would be liable. It is true that
an act which one has the right to do under all circumstances, like the
bringing of a suit upon a valid claim (Friel <em>v.</em> Plumer, 69 N. H. 498),
cannot be made actionable by the motive which accompanies it. But
as applied to the use of real estate the argument begs the question
which is whether the enjoyment of real estate includes the right to
use it solely to injure another. Because when employed for a useful
purpose such use may rightfully injure another, it does not follow
that the same use for a wrongful purpose may also rightfully injure
another, except upon the theory of absolute dominion, for the character
of the use is an element of the right.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As a general proposition, it is safe to say that the owner of land
has a right to make a reasonable use of his property; and that right
extends as well to an unlimited distance above the earth’s surface as
to an unlimited distance below. He may not only dig for a foundation
and a cellar as deep as he pleases, but he may erect his building
as high as he pleases into the air, subject all the time, of course, to a
proper application of the doctrine contained in the maxim, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic utere
tuo ut alienum non lædas</span></i>. The erection and maintenance of buildings
for habitation or business is a customary and reasonable use of land.
Of course the landowner, in making such erections, must be held to
the exercise of all due care against infringing the legal rights of others,
to be determined by the nature of the rights and interests to be
affected, and all the circumstances of each particular case.” Ladd, J.,
in Garland <em>v.</em> Towne, 55 N. H. 55, 58.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Property in land must be considered, for many purposes, not as
an absolute, unrestricted dominion, but as an aggregation of qualified
privileges, the limits of which are prescribed by the equality of rights
and the correlation of rights and obligations necessary for the highest
enjoyment of land by the entire community of proprietors.... The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_933'>933</span>soil is often called property, and this use of language is sufficiently
accurate for some purposes. But the proposition that the soil is property
conveys a very imperfect idea of the numerous and variously
limited rights comprised in landed estate; and it is sometimes necessary
to remember that the name of property belongs to some of the
essential proprietary rights vested in the person called the owner of
the soil.... So these proprietary rights, which are the only valuable
ingredients of a landowner’s property, may be taken from him, without
an asportation or adverse personal occupation of that portion of
the earth which is his in the limited sense of being the subject of
certain legally recognized proprietary rights which he may exercise
for a short time.... One of Eaton’s proprietary rights was the correlative
of R.’s duty of abstaining from such a use of air and water,
and from such an interference with their quality and circulation, as
would be unreasonable and injurious to the enjoyment of Eaton’s
farm.” Thompson <em>v.</em> Androscoggin Co., 54 N. H. 545, 551, 552, 554.
“Excavations maliciously made in one’s own land, with a view to
destroy a spring or well in his neighbor’s land, could not be regarded
as reasonable.” Swett <em>v.</em> Cutts, 50 N. H. 439, 447.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If a man has no right to dig a hole upon his premises, not for any
benefit to himself or his premises, but for the express purpose of
destroying his neighbor’s spring, why can he be permitted to shut out
light and air from his neighbor’s windows maliciously, and without
profit or benefit to himself? By analogy, it seems to me that the same
principle applies in both cases, and that the law will interpose and prevent
the wanton injury in both cases.... It must be remembered
that no man has a legal right to make a malicious use of his property&#160;... for the avowed purpose of damaging his neighbor. To hold
otherwise would make the law a convenient engine in cases like the
present to injure and destroy the peace and comfort, and to damage
the property, of one’s neighbor, for no other than a wicked purpose,
which in itself is or ought to be unlawful. The right to do this cannot,
in an enlightened country, exist either in the use of property or
in any way or manner.... The right to breathe the air, and to enjoy
the sunshine, is a natural one; and no man can pollute the atmosphere,
or shut out the light of heaven, for no better reason than that the
situation of his property is such that he is given the opportunity of so
doing, and wishes to gratify his spite and malice towards his neighbor.”
Morse, J., in Burke <em>v.</em> Smith, 69 Mich. 380, approved and
unanimously adopted in Flaherty <em>v.</em> Moran, 81 Mich. 52, above cited.</p>

<p class='c007'>“While one may in general put his property to any use he pleases
not in itself unlawful, his neighbor has the same right to the undisturbed
enjoyment of his adjoining property.... What standard does
the law provide?... Whatever may be the law in other jurisdictions,
it must be regarded as settled in this state that the test is the
reasonableness or unreasonableness of the business in question under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_934'>934</span>all the circumstances.” Ladd <em>v.</em> Brick Co., 68 N. H. 185,186. “The
common-law right of the ownership of land, in its relationship to the
control of surface water, as understood by the courts of this state for
many years, does not sanction or authorize practical injustice to one
landowner by the arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the right of
dominion by another” (Franklin <em>v.</em> Durgee, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>), but makes the
test of the right the reasonableness of the use under all the circumstances.
In such case the purpose of the use, whether understood
by the landowner to be necessary or useful to himself, or merely intended
to harm another, may be decisive upon the question of right.
It cannot be justly contended that a purely malicious use is a reasonable
use. The question of reasonableness depends upon all the circumstances—the
advantage and profit to one of the use attacked,
and the unavoidable injury to the other. Where the only advantage
to one is the pleasure of injuring another, there remains no foundation
upon which it can be determined that the disturbance of the
other in the lawful enjoyment of his estate is reasonable or necessary.
There is no sound ground upon which a distinction can be made
against the plaintiff’s right to use his land for the enjoyment of the
air and light which naturally come upon it, in favor of his right to
use it to enjoy the waters which naturally flow upon or under it, except
the fact that the use of land for buildings necessarily cuts off
air and light from the adjoining estate. The fact that the improvement
of real estate in this way for a useful purpose, universally conceded
to be reasonable, may affect the adjoining owner’s enjoyment
of his estate to the same extent as a like act done solely to injure the
other, is not a sufficient reason for distinguishing the right to build
upon the surface from the right to dig below it or to control the surface
itself. Jurisdictions which reject the doctrine of reasonable
necessity, reasonable care, and reasonable use, which “prevail in this
state in a liberal form, on a broad basis of general principle” (Haley
<em>v.</em> Colcord, 59 N. H. 7), as applied to the ownership of real estate, in
favor of the principle of absolute dominion, may properly consider a
malicious motive immaterial upon the rightfulness of a particular use;
but in this state, to do so would be to reject the principle announced
in Bassett <em>v.</em> Company, 43 N. H. 569, and repeatedly reaffirmed during
the last forty years.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be conceded that the maxim <em>sic utere tuo ut alienum non
lædas</em> is to be applied as forbidding injury, not merely to the property,
but to the right of another. Ladd <em>v.</em> Brick Co., 68 N. H. 185; Pittsburg,
&amp;c. R’y <em>v.</em> Bingham, 29 Ohio St. 364; Letts <em>v.</em> Kessler, 54 Ohio
St. 73; Bonomi <em>v.</em> Backhouse, E. B. &amp; E. 622, 643; Jeffries <em>v.</em> Williams,
5 Exch. 792. But the landowner’s right in the enjoyment of
his estate being that of reasonable use merely, there attaches at once
to each the correlative right not to be disturbed by the malicious, and
hence unreasonable, use made by another. To hold that a right is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_935'>935</span>infringed because, by the noxious use made by another, the air coming
upon a landowner’s premises is made more or less injurious, and
to deny the invasion of a right by an unreasonable use which shuts
off air and light entirely, is an attempt to bound a right inherent and
essential to the common enjoyment of property by the limitations of
an ancient form of action. An unreasonable use of one estate may
constitute a nuisance by its diminution of the right of enjoyment of
another, without furnishing all the elements necessary to maintain an
action <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quare clausum fregit</span></i>; though in particular cases it may be
said that no right is invaded unless something comes from the one
lot to the other. Lane <em>v.</em> Concord, 70 N. H. 485, 488, 489; Thompson
<em>v.</em> Androscoggin Co., 54 N. H. 545, 552; Wood, Nuis., s. 611.
As, therefore, the statute does not deprive the plaintiff of any right to
reasonable use, it does not deprive him of any property right. Hence
it is not necessary to inquire whether, as an invasion of property rights,
the limitation of the statute is one which might properly be made for
the general good.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The objection based upon the unconstitutionality of the statute is
not sustained, and the exception to the denial of the motions for a
nonsuit and to direct a verdict upon that ground is overruled.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>KEEBLE <em>v.</em> HICKERINGILL<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Queen’s Bench, Trinity Term, 1706.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 11 East, 574, note.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Action upon the case. Plaintiff declares that he was, 8th November
in the second year of the Queen, lawfully possessed of a close of
land called Minott’s Meadow, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et de quodam vivario, vocato</span></i> a decoy
pond, to which divers wild fowl used to resort and come; and the
plaintiff had at his own costs and charges prepared and procured divers
decoy ducks, nets, machines, and other engines for the decoying and
taking of the wild fowl, and enjoyed the benefit in taking them: the
defendant knowing which, and intending to damnify the plaintiff in
his vivary, and to fright and drive away the wild fowl used to resort
thither, and deprive him of his profit, did, on the 8th of November,
resort to the head of the said pond and vivary, and did discharge six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_936'>936</span>guns laden with gunpowder, and with the noise and stink of the gunpowder
did drive away the wild fowl then being in the pond: and on
the 11th and 12th days of November the defendant, with design to
damnify the plaintiff, and fright away the wild fowl, did place himself
with a gun near the vivary, and there did discharge the said gun
several times that was then charged with the gunpowder against the
said decoy pond, whereby the wild fowl were frighted away, and did
forsake the said pond. Upon not guilty pleaded, a verdict was found
for the plaintiff and £20 damages.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Holt, C. J.</span> I am of opinion that this action doth lie. It seems to
be new in its instance, but is not new in the reason or principle of it.
For, first, this using or making a decoy is lawful. Secondly, this employment
of his ground to that use is profitable to the plaintiff, as is
the skill and management of that employment. As to the first, every
man that hath a property may employ it for his pleasure and profit, as
for alluring and procuring decoy ducks to come to his pond. To learn
the trade of seducing other ducks to come there in order to be taken is
not prohibited either by the law of the land or the moral law; but it is
as lawful to use art to seduce them, to catch them, and destroy them
for the use of mankind, as to kill and destroy wild fowl or tame cattle.
Then when a man useth his art or his skill to take them, to sell and dispose
of for his profit; this is his trade; and he that hinders another in
his trade or livelihood is liable to an action for so hindering him. Why
otherwise are scandalous words spoken of a man in his profession
actionable, when without his profession they are not so? Though they
do not affect any damage, yet are they mischievous in themselves; and
therefore in their own nature productive of damage; and therefore an
action lies against him. Such are all words that are spoken of a man
to disparage him in his trade, that may bring damage to him; though
they do not charge him with any crime that may make him obnoxious
to punishment; as to say a merchant is broken, or that he is failing,
or is not able to pay his debts, 1 Roll. 60, 1; all the cases there put.
How much more, when the defendant doth an actual and real damage
to another when he is in the very act of receiving profit by his employment.
Now there are two sorts of acts for doing damage to a man’s
employment, for which an action lies; the one is in respect of a
man’s privilege; the other is in respect of his property. In that of
a man’s franchise or privilege whereby he hath a fair, market, or ferry,
if another shall use the like liberty, though out of his limits, he shall
be liable to an action; though by grant from the King. But therein is
the difference to be taken between a liberty in which the public hath a
benefit, and that wherein the public is not concerned. 22 H. 6, 14, 15.
The other is where a violent or malicious act is done to a man’s occupation,
profession, or way of getting a livelihood; there an action lies
in all cases. But if a man doth him damage by using the same employment;
as if Mr. Hickeringill had set up another decoy on his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_937'>937</span>ground near the plaintiff’s, and that had spoiled the custom of the
plaintiff, no action would lie, because he had as much liberty to make
and use a decoy as the plaintiff. This is like the case of 11 H. 4, 47.
One schoolmaster sets up a new school to the damage of an ancient
school, and thereby the scholars are allured from the old school to
come to his new. (The action there was held not to lie.) But suppose
Mr. Hickeringill should lie in the way with his guns, and fright the
boys from going to school, and their parents would not let them go
thither; sure that schoolmaster might have an action for the loss of
his scholars. 29 E. 3, 18. A man hath a market, to which he hath toll
for horses sold: a man is bringing his horse to market to sell: a
stranger hinders and obstructs him from going thither to the market:
an action lies, because it imports damage. Action upon the case lies
against one that shall by threats fright away his tenants at will. 9 H.
7, 8; 21 H. 6, 31; 9 H. 7, 7; 14 Ed. 4, 7; Vide Rastal. 662; 2 Cro.

hindered from taking his toll; the obstruction is a damage, though not
the loss of his service.<a id='r590'></a><a href='#f590' class='c015'><sup>[590]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c013'>IBOTTSON <em>v.</em> PEAT<br /> <span class='sc'>In the Exchequer, May 1, 1865.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 3 Hurlstone &amp; Coltman, 644.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Bramwell, B.</span><a id='r591'></a><a href='#f591' class='c015'><sup>[591]</sup></a> I am also of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled
to judgment. The declaration states that the plaintiff being possessed
of certain land, the defendant unlawfully and with intent to drive and
frighten away game then being on the land of the plaintiff, and to
prevent him from shooting them, fired rockets and combustibles close
to and over the land of the plaintiff, so as to be a nuisance to him.
The defendant by his plea admits that the matter alleged is true, but
sets up a right to do what is complained of for the purpose attributed
to the defendant in the declaration, viz., to prevent him from shooting
the game. Then what is the reason given? It is this:—“The game
which I frightened was game which you enticed away from the Duke
of Rutland’s land, by placing corn and other food for them on your
land; and therefore I, as the servant of the Duke, in order to prevent
you from shooting the game, and from continuing to entice them, did
the acts complained of.” In my opinion that is a bad plea. There is
nothing in point of law to prevent the plaintiff from doing that which
the plea alleges he has done. I say “in point of law,” because it cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_938'>938</span>be contended for a moment that any action would lie against the
plaintiff. As to the propriety of such conduct between gentlemen and
neighbors I say nothing. Where a person’s game is attracted from his
land, he ought to offer them stronger inducements to return to it. It
is like the case I referred to in the course of the argument, Chasemore
<em>v.</em> Richards, 2 H. &amp; N. 168, 7 H. L. 349, which shows that if a man
has the misfortune to lose his spring by his neighbor digging a well,
he must dig his own well deeper.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>FISHER <em>v.</em> FEIGE<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Court, California, July 14, 1902.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 137 California Reports, 39.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Appeal by defendants from a judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plaintiff is a lower riparian proprietor on a certain watercourse,
and defendants are upper riparian proprietors thereon. The action
was brought to recover damages in the sum of five thousand dollars
for certain alleged interferences by defendants with the flow of the
water in the stream, and for a perpetual injunction restraining defendants
from their repetition of the alleged wrongs.<a id='r592'></a><a href='#f592' class='c015'><sup>[592]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is averred that along and adjacent to the stream as it flows
through defendants’ land there is a heavy growth of timber, which,
before the alleged wrongful acts of defendants, protected the waters of
the stream from evaporation by drying winds and the rays of the sun,
and that the defendants have cut and felled a large number of trees,
and thus let in the sun and the wind and caused the waters to be diminished
by evaporation, so that not as much flowed down on to plaintiff’s
land as formerly; and that they threatened to fell more of said trees in
the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is also averred, and found by the court, that said acts were done
by defendants “solely for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff and
damaging his said property, and out of spite and ill-will towards the
plaintiff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The court found that plaintiff was damaged in the sum of one cent
by the alleged wrongs, for which amount judgment was rendered. By
the judgment the defendants were also “perpetually enjoined”&#160;...
“from cutting or felling the timbers and trees growing in the channel
and upon the immediate banks of said stream at any point above the
said lands of the plaintiff, whereby the said stream will be exposed
to the rays of the sun and the waters thereof lost or materially diminished
by evaporation.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_939'>939</span>Defendants appealed from the judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>McFarland, J.</span> [After discussing the question of motive.]</p>

<p class='c007'>... Under the facts found we cannot see how the lawfulness of
the acts enjoined can depend upon the motives by which they were
done, or may be done in the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is found that the defendants did fell trees on their lands, and
threatened to fell more, the effect of which was, and would be, to
let in the sun and winds, and thus increase evaporation.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>It is quite apparent that cutting trees upon one’s own land is a lawful
act, which cannot be restrained because it “lets in the sun” and
causes more evaporation; any incidental damage which might come
to a lower riparian owner from such lawful act would clearly be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum

<h4 class='c013'>ALLEN <em>v.</em> FLOOD<br /> <span class='sc'>In the House of Lords, December 14, 1897.</span><br /> <em>Reported in [1898] Appeal Cases, 1.</em></h4>

<p class='c022'>The plaintiffs (now the respondents), Flood and Taylor, are members of
the Shipwrights’ Provident Union.<a id='r593'></a><a href='#f593' class='c015'><sup>[593]</sup></a> The defendant (now the appellant), Allen,
is a member and the London delegate of the Independent Society of
Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders. The latter society restricts the
labor of its members to ironwork. The society of shipwrights permits its members
to work either in wood or iron. The members of the boilermakers’ society
are accustomed to claim that the proper business of shipwrights is to work in
wood only, and that shipwrights who work in iron are trespassing on the trade
of the boilermakers’ union.<a id='r594'></a><a href='#f594' class='c015'><sup>[594]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>In April, 1894, about forty men of the boilermakers’ society were engaged
at the Regent Dock, Millwall, in repairing an iron ship, on the employment of
the Glengall Iron Company. Flood and Taylor were at the same time employed
by the Glengall Company to execute repairs upon the woodwork of the
vessel. By the terms of their employment they were entitled to leave at the
close of any day; and the Glengall Company might, at the close of any day
cease to employ them further. The ironworkers were employed on similar
terms.<a id='r595'></a><a href='#f595' class='c015'><sup>[595]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_940'>940</span>The boilermakers, on discovering that Flood and Taylor had shortly before
been employed by another firm (Mills &amp; Knight) on the Thames in doing ironwork
on a ship, became much excited, and began to talk of leaving their employment.
One of them telegraphed for Allen, their London delegate. Allen
came, dissuaded them from leaving work at dinner-time, and told them that
they must wait and see how things were settled. Allen then had an interview
with Halkett, the Glengall Company’s manager. As to what took place at this
interview, the testimony at the subsequent trial was conflicting. The version
most favorable to the plaintiffs was substantially as follows:—</p>

<p class='c019'>Allen told Halkett that he (Allen) had been sent for because Flood and
Taylor were known to have done ironwork in Mills &amp; Knight’s yard, and that
unless Flood and Taylor were discharged all the members of the boilermakers’
society would be “called out” or “knock off” work that day; that Halkett
had no option; that there was no ill-feeling towards the Glengall Company or
towards Flood and Taylor personally,<a id='r596'></a><a href='#f596' class='c015'><sup>[596]</sup></a> but that the iron-men were doing their
best to put an end to the practice of Shipwrights doing ironwork, and that
wherever these men were employed, or other shipwrights who had done ironwork,
the boilermakers would cease work,—in every yard on the Thames.</p>

<p class='c019'>If the boilermakers had been called out, it would have stopped the Glengall
Company’s business. For fear that the threat would be carried out,
Halkett discharged Flood and Taylor at the close of the day.</p>

<p class='c019'>An action was then brought by Flood and Taylor against three persons, viz.,
Allen, the London delegate; Jackson, the chairman; and Knight, the general
secretary of the Boilermakers’ Society.<a id='r597'></a><a href='#f597' class='c015'><sup>[597]</sup></a> The plaintiffs’ allegations were: that
the defendants, maliciously and wrongfully and with intent to injure the
plaintiffs, procured and induced the Glengall Company to break their contract
with the plaintiffs and not to enter into new contracts with them; and also,
maliciously, etc., intimidated and coerced the Glengall Company to break
their contract with plaintiffs and not to enter into new contracts, and also unlawfully
and maliciously conspired with others to do the above acts.</p>

<p class='c019'>The case was tried by jury before <span class='sc'>Kennedy, J.</span></p>

<p class='c019'>The learned judge ruled that there was not “a shred of evidence of any
conspiracy at all;” that there was “no evidence of anything amounting to
intimidation or coercion in any legal sense of the term;”<a id='r598'></a><a href='#f598' class='c015'><sup>[598]</sup></a> and that there was
no breach of contract.</p>

<p class='c019'>The following questions, among others, were put to the jury:—</p>

<p class='c019'>1. Did the defendant Allen maliciously induce the Glengall Iron Company
to discharge the plaintiffs or either of them from their employment?</p>

<p class='c019'>2. Did the defendant Allen maliciously induce the Glengall Iron Company
not to engage the plaintiffs or either of them?</p>

<p class='c019'>In putting these questions to the jury, <span class='sc'>Kennedy, J.</span>, gave some explanations,
portions of which are, in substance, as follows:<a id='r599'></a><a href='#f599' class='c015'><sup>[599]</sup></a> “The word ‘malice’
is a word of art in law, and it does not mean in this case a personal dislike, a
personal feeling of resentment against the two plaintiffs. It is clear from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_941'>941</span>evidence of the men and of their employers that there was no such personal
feeling in this case. The question that I want you to answer is, that, if you
find he induced the Glengall Iron Company, by the threat which is suggested
by the plaintiffs of calling out all the men on strike, did he do that with the
malicious intention which I have endeavored to explain, that is, merely, not
for the purpose of forwarding that which he believed to be his interest as a
delegate of his union in the fair consideration of that interest but for the
purpose of injuring these plaintiffs, and preventing them doing that which
they were each of them entitled to do. ‘Maliciously’ means, connected with
the word ‘induce,’ this,—that it was not for the mere purpose of forwarding
fairly Allen’s own interests, but from the indirect motive of doing a mischief
to the plaintiffs in their lawful business.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The jury answered both questions in the affirmative; and also found that
each plaintiff had suffered 20<em>l.</em> damages.</p>

<p class='c019'>After consideration, <span class='sc'>Kennedy, J.</span>, entered judgment for the plaintiffs
against Allen for 40<em>l.</em> This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal
(<span class='sc'>Lord Esher, M. R.</span>, <span class='sc'>Lopes</span> and <span class='sc'>Rigby</span>, L.JJ.); L. R. (1895) 2 Q. B. 21.</p>

<p class='c019'>Against these decisions, Allen brought the present appeal to the House of
Lords. The appeal was first argued in December, 1895. Their Lordships
having required further argument, the appeal was reargued in March and
April, 1897. The following Judges were summoned to attend<a id='r600'></a><a href='#f600' class='c015'><sup>[600]</sup></a> at the second
argument: <span class='sc'>Hawkins</span>, <span class='sc'>Mathew</span>, <span class='sc'>Cave</span>, <span class='sc'>North</span>, <span class='sc'>Wills</span>, <span class='sc'>Grantham</span>, <span class='sc'>Lawrence</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Wright</span>, JJ.</p>

<p class='c019'>At the close of the arguments, the following question was propounded to
the Judges: Assuming the evidence given by the plaintiffs’ witnesses to be
correct, was there any evidence of a cause of action fit to be left to the jury?</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Mathew, J.</span>, and <span class='sc'>Wright, J.</span>, answered the question in the negative; and
the other six Judges in the affirmative.</p>

<p class='c019'>After the delivery of the opinions of the Judges, the House took time for
consideration.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dec. 14, 1897. <span class='sc'>Lord Halsbury, L. C.</span>... The first objection made to
the plaintiff’s right to recover for the loss which they thus undoubtedly suffered
is that no right of the plaintiffs was infringed, and that the right contended
for on their behalf is not a right recognized by law, or, at all events,
only such a right as every one else is entitled to deprive them of if they stop
short of physical violence or obstruction. I think the right to employ their
labor as they will is a right both recognized by the law and sufficiently guarded
by its provisions to make any undue interference with that right an actionable
wrong.</p>

<p class='c019'>Very early authorities in the law have recognized the right; and, in my
view, no authority can be found which questions or qualifies it. The schoolmaster
who complained that his scholars were being assaulted and brought an
action, the quarry owner who complained that his servants were being menaced
and molested, were both held to have a right of action. And it appears
to me that the importance of those cases, and the principle established by
them, have not been sufficiently considered. It is said that threats of violence
or actual violence were unlawful means: the lawfulness of the means I will
discuss hereafter. But the point on which these cases are important is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_942'>942</span>existence of the right. It was not the schoolmaster who was assaulted; it was
not the quarry owner who was assaulted or threatened; but, nevertheless, the
schoolmaster was held entitled to bring an action in respect of the loss of
scholars attending his school, and the quarry owner in respect of the loss of
workmen to his quarry. They were third persons; no violence or threats were
applied to them, and the cause of action, which they had a right to insist on,
was the indirect effect upon themselves of violence and threats applied to
others.</p>

<p class='c019'>My Lords, in my view these are binding authorities to show that the preliminary
question, namely, whether there was any right of the plaintiffs to
pursue their calling unmolested, must be answered in the affirmative. The
question of what is the right invaded would seem to be reasonably answered,
and the universality of the right to all Her Majesty’s subjects seems to me to
be no argument against its existence. It is, indeed, part of that freedom from
restraint, that liberty of action, which, in my view, may be found running
through the principles of our law.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>First it is said that the company were acting within their legal rights in
discharging the plaintiffs. So they were; but does that affect the question of
the responsibility of the person who caused them so to act by the means he
used? The scholars who went away from the school were entitled to do so.
The miners were entitled to cease working at the quarry. The natives were
entitled to avoid running the risk of being shot; but the question is, What was
the cause of their thus exercising their legal right?</p>

<p class='c019'>The question must be whether what was done in fact, and what did in fact
procure the dismissal of the plaintiff, was an actionable wrong or not. I have
never heard that a man who was dismissed from his service by reason of some
slander could not maintain an action against the slanderer because the master
had a legal right to discharge him.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>It will be observed that Kennedy, J., draws a distinction between the conduct
which he assumes to be lawful on Allen’s part to do what he did do if it
were merely for the purpose of forwarding that which he believed to be his
interest as a delegate of his union in fair consideration of that interest on the
one hand, and on the other hand his conduct if what he did was done for the
purpose of injuring these plaintiffs.</p>

<p class='c019'>My Lords, it appears to me that that is a direction of which the defendants
cannot complain, since it puts what is to my mind an alternative more favorable
to them. In my view, his belief that what he was doing was for his
interest as a delegate of his union would not justify the doing of what he did
do. It is alleged, and to my mind and to the mind of the jury proved, that
the employers were compelled under pressure of the threats that he used to
discharge the plaintiffs.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>But the objection made by the defendants appears to be that the word
“malicious” adds nothing; that if the thing was lawful it was lawful absolutely;
if it was not lawful it was unlawful,—the addition of the word “malicious”
can make no difference. The fallacy appears to me to reside in the
assumption that everything must be absolutely lawful or absolutely unlawful.
There are many things which may become lawful or unlawful according
to circumstances.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_943'>943</span>In a decision of this House it has undoubtedly been held that whatever a
man’s motives may be, he may dig into his own land and divert subterranean
water which but for his so treating his own land might have reached his neighbor’s
land. But that is because the neighbor had no right to the flow of the
subterranean water in that direction, and he had an absolute right to do what
he would with his own property. But what analogy has such a case with
the intentional inflicting of injury upon another person’s property, reputation,
or lawful occupation? To dig into one’s own land under the circumstances
stated requires no cause or excuse. He may act from mere caprice, but his
right on his own land is absolute, so long as he does not interfere with the
rights of others.</p>

<p class='c019'>But, referring to Bowen, L. J.’s observation, which to my mind is exactly
accurate, “in order to justify the intentional doing of that which is calculated
in the ordinary course of events to damage, and which does, in fact, damage
another in that other person’s property or trade,” you must have some just
cause or excuse.</p>

<p class='c019'>Now, the word “malicious” appears to me to negative just cause or excuse;
and without attempting an exhaustive exposition of the word itself, it appears
to me that, if I apply the language of Bowen, L. J., it is enough to show that
this was within the meaning of the law “malicious.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It appears to me that no better illustration can be given of the distinction
on which I am insisting between an act which can be legally done and an act
which cannot be so done because tainted with malice, than such a colloquy
between the representative of the master and the representative of the men as
might have been held on the occasion which has given rise to this action. If
the representative of the men had in good faith and without indirect motive
pointed out the inconvenience that might result from having two sets of men
working together on the same ship, whose views upon the particular question
were so diverse that it would be inexpedient to bring them together, no one
could have complained; but if his object was to punish the men belonging to
another union because on some former occasion they had worked on an iron
ship, it seems to me that the difference of motive may make the whole difference
between the lawfulness or unlawfulness of what he did.</p>

<p class='c019'>I see it is suggested by one of your Lordships that the action for malicious
prosecution is supposed to be an exception. I am not quite certain that I
understand what is the proposition to which it is an exception. If it means
that there is no other form of procedure known to the law wherein malice may
make the distinction between a lawful and an unlawful act, I am unable to
agree. Maliciously procuring a person to be made a bankrupt, maliciously
and without reasonable or probable cause presenting a petition to wind up a
company, or maliciously procuring an arrest, are equally cases wherein the
state of mind of the person procuring the arrest may affect the question of the
lawfulness or unlawfulness of the act done.</p>

<p class='c019'>Again, in slander or libel the right to preserve one’s character or business
from attack appears to me quite as vague and general a right as it is suggested
is the right to pursue one’s occupation unmolested; and it cannot be denied
that in both these cases the lawfulness or unlawfulness of what is said or
written may depend upon the absence or presence of malice.</p>

<p class='c019'>Doubtless there are cases in which the mere presence of malice in an act
done will not necessarily give a right of action, since no damage may result;
and in this case, however malicious Allen’s intervention may have been, if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_944'>944</span>employers had defied Allen’s threats instead of yielding to them, the plaintiffs
could not have succeeded in an action, because they would not have been injured:
see Quartz Hill Co. <em>v.</em> Eyre, 11 Q. B. D. 674; Gibbs <em>v.</em> Pike, 9 M. &amp; W.
351; Jenings <em>v.</em> Florence, (1857) 2 C. B. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>) 467.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Lord Watson.</span>... There is no expression in the verdict which can be
held, either directly or by implication, to impeach the legality of the company’s
conduct in discharging the respondents. The mere fact of an employer
discharging or refusing to engage a workman does not imply or even suggest
the absence of his legal right to do either as he may choose. It is true that
the company is not a party to this suit; but it is also obvious that the character
of the act induced, whether legal or illegal, may have a bearing upon the
liability in law of the person who procured it. The whole pith of the verdict,
in so far as it directly concerns the appellant, is contained in the word “maliciously,”—a
word which is susceptible of many different meanings. The
expression “maliciously induce,” as it occurs upon the face of the verdict, is
ambiguous: it is capable of signifying that the appellant knowingly induced
an act which of itself constituted a civil wrong, or it may simply mean that
the appellant procured, with intent to injure the respondents, an act which,
apart from motive, would not have amounted to a civil wrong; and it is, in my
opinion, material to ascertain in which of these senses it was used by the jury.</p>

<p class='c019'>Although the rule may be otherwise with regard to crimes, the law of
England does not, according to my apprehension, take into account motive as
constituting an element of civil wrong. Any invasion of the civil rights of
another person is in itself a legal wrong, carrying with it liability to repair its
necessary or natural consequences, in so far as these are injurious to the person
whose right is infringed, whether the motive which prompted it be good,
bad, or indifferent. But the existence of a bad motive, in the case of an act
which is not in itself illegal, will not convert that act into a civil wrong for
which reparation is due. A wrongful act, done knowingly and with a view to
its injurious consequences, may, in the sense of law, be malicious; but such
malice derives its essential character from the circumstance that the act done
constitutes a violation of the law. There is a class of cases which have sometimes
been referred to as evidencing that a bad motive may be an element in
the composition of civil wrong; but in these cases the wrong must have its
root in an act which the law generally regards as illegal, but excuses its perpetration
in certain exceptional circumstances from considerations of public
policy. These are well known as cases of privilege, in which the protection
which the law gives to an individual who is within the scope of these considerations
consists in this,—that he may with immunity commit an act which
is a legal wrong and but for his privilege would afford a good cause of action
against him, all that is required in order to raise the privilege and entitle him
to protection being that he shall act honestly in the discharge of some duty
which the law recognizes, and shall not be prompted by a desire to injure the
person who is affected by his act. Accordingly, in a suit brought by that person,
it is usual for him to allege and necessary for him to prove an intent to
injure in order to destroy the privilege of the defendant. But none of these
cases tend to establish that an act which does not amount to a legal wrong,
and therefore needs no protection, can have privilege attached to it; and still
less that an act in itself lawful is converted into a legal wrong if it was done
from a bad motive.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_945'>945</span>[After quoting from <span class='sc'>Bowen, L. J.</span>, in Mogul Steamship Co. <em>v.</em> McGregor,
and <span class='sc'>Bayley, J.</span>, in Bromage <em>v.</em> Prosser.]</p>

<p class='c019'>The root of the principle is that, in any legal question, malice depends, not
upon evil motive which influenced the mind of the actor, but upon the illegal
character of the act which he contemplated and committed. In my opinion it
is alike consistent with reason and common sense that when the act done is,
apart from the feelings which prompted it, legal, the civil law ought to take no
cognizance of its motive.</p>

<p class='c019'>It does not appear to me to admit of doubt that the jury, in finding the
action of the company to have been maliciously induced by the appellant,
simply meant to affirm that the appellant was influenced by a bad motive,
namely, an intention to injure the respondents in their trade or calling of
shipwrights.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>There are, in my opinion, two grounds only upon which a person who procures
the act of another can be made legally responsible for its consequences.
In the first place, he will incur liability if he knowingly and for his own ends
induces that other person to commit an actionable wrong. In the second place,
when the act induced is within the right of the immediate actor, and is therefore
not wrongful in so far as he is concerned, it may yet be to the detriment
of a third party; and in that case, according to the law laid down by the
majority in Lumley <em>v.</em> Gye, 2 E. &amp; B. 216, the inducer may be held liable if he
can be shown to have procured his object by the use of illegal means directed
against that third party.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>Assuming that the Glengall Iron Company, in dispensing with the further
services of the respondents, were guilty of no wrong, I am willing to take it
that any person who procured their act might incur responsibility to those who
were injuriously affected by it, if he employed unlawful means of inducement
directed against them. According to the decision of the majority in Lumley
<em>v.</em> Gye, 2 E. &amp; B. 216, already referred to, a person who by illegal means, that
is, means which in themselves are in the nature of civil wrongs, procures
the lawful act of another, which act is calculated to injure, and does injure,
a third party, commits a wrong for which he may be made answerable. So
long as the word “means” is understood in its natural and proper sense, that
rule appears to me to be intelligible; but I am altogether unable to appreciate
the loose logic which confounds internal feeling with outward acts, and treats
the motive of the actor as one of the means employed by him.</p>

<p class='c019'>It has been maintained, and some of the learned judges who lent their
assistance to the House have favored the argument, that the appellant used
coercion as a means of compelling the Glengall Iron Company to terminate
their connection with the respondents; but that conclusion does not appear to
me to be the fair result of the evidence. If coercion, in the only legal sense
of the term, was employed, it was a wrong done as much to the Glengall Iron
Company, who are the parties said to have been coerced, as to the respondents.
Its result might be prejudicial to the respondents, but its efficacy wholly
depended upon its being directed against and operating upon the company.
It must be kept in view that the question of what amounts to wrongful coercion
in a legal sense involves the same considerations which I have discussed
in relation to the elements of a civil wrong as committed by the immediate
actor. According to my opinion, coercion, whatever be its nature, must, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_946'>946</span>order to infer the legal liability of the person who employs it, be intrinsically
and irrespectively of its motive a wrongful act. According to the doctrine
ventilated in Temperton <em>v.</em> Russell, [1893] 1 Q. B. 715, and the present case it
need not amount to a wrong, but will become wrongful if it was prompted by
a bad motive.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>I have already indicated that, in my opinion, no light is thrown upon the
decision of the present question by Pitt <em>v.</em> Donovan, 1 M. &amp; S. 639, and other
cases of that class. The defendant had in that case represented, contrary to
the fact, that the plaintiff was insane at the time when he executed a particular
deed. The communication was made to a person to whom the defendant
was under a legal duty to make the disclosure if it had been true; and the
defendant was in law absolved from the ordinary consequences of his having
circulated a libel which was false and injurious, if he honestly believed it to
be true. The law applicable in cases of that description is, I apprehend, beyond
all doubt; but the rule by which the law in certain exceptional cases
excuses the perpetration of a wrong, by reason of the absence of evil motive, is
insufficient to establish or to support the converse and very different proposition,
that the presence of an evil motive will convert a legal act into a legal
wrong.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>[The opinions of <span class='sc'>Lord Ashbourne</span>, and <span class='sc'>Lord Morris</span>, concurring with
<span class='sc'>Lord Halsbury</span>, are omitted.]</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Lord Herschell.</span></p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>Great stress was laid at the bar on the circumstance that in an action for
maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause putting in motion legal
process an evil motive is an essential ingredient. I have always understood
and I think that has been the general understanding, that this was an exceptional
case. The person against whom proceedings have been initiated
without reasonable and probable cause is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> wronged. It might
well have been held that an action always lay for thus putting the law in
motion. But I apprehend that the person taking proceedings was saved
from liability if he acted in good faith because it was thought that men
might otherwise be too much deterred from enforcing the law, and that
this would be disadvantageous to the public. Some of the learned judges
cite actions of libel and slander as instances in which the legal liability depends
on the presence or absence of malice. I think this is a mistake. The
man who defames another by false allegations is liable to an action, however
good his motive, and however honestly he believed in the statement he made.
It is true that in a limited class of cases the law, under certain circumstances,
regards the occasion as privileged, and exonerates the person who has made
false defamatory statements from liability if he has made them in good faith.
But if there be not that duty or interest which in law creates the privilege,
then, though the person making the statements may have acted from the
best of motives, and felt it his duty to make them, he is none the less liable.
The gist of the action is that the statement was false and defamatory. Because
in a strictly limited class of cases the law allows the defence that the
statements were made in good faith, it seems to me, with all deference, illogical
to affirm that malice constitutes one of the elements of the torts known to
the law as libel and slander. But even if it could be established that in cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_947'>947</span>falling within certain well-defined categories, it is settled law that an evil
motive renders actionable acts otherwise innocent, that is surely far from
showing that such a motive always makes actionable acts prejudicial to another
which are otherwise lawful, or that it does so in cases like the present
utterly dissimilar from those within the categories referred to.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>If the fact be that malice is the gist of the action for inducing or procuring
an act to be done to the prejudice of another, and not that the act induced
or procured is an unlawful one as being a breach of contract or otherwise, I
can see no possible ground for confining the action to cases in which the thing
induced is the not entering into a contract. It seems to me that it must
equally lie in the case of every lawful act which one man induces another to
do where his purpose is to injure his neighbor or to benefit himself at his expense.
I cannot hold that such a proposition is tenable in principle, and no
authority is to be found for it. I should be the last to suggest that the fact
that there was no precedent was in all cases conclusive against the right to
maintain an action. It is the function of the Courts to apply established legal
principles to the changing circumstances and conditions of human life. But
the motive of injuring one’s neighbor or of benefiting one’s self at his expense
is as old as human nature. It must for centuries have moved men in countless
instances to persuade others to do or to refrain from doing particular acts.
The fact that under such circumstances no authority for an action founded on
these elements has been discovered does go far to show that such an action
cannot be maintained.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>I now proceed to consider on principle the proposition advanced by the respondents,
the alleged authorities for which I have been discussing. I do not
doubt that every one has a right to pursue his trade or employment without
“molestation” or “obstruction,” if those terms are used to imply some act in
itself wrongful. This is only a branch of a much wider proposition, namely,
that every one has a right to do any lawful act he pleases without molestation
or obstruction. If it be intended to assert that an act not otherwise wrongful
always becomes so if it interferes with another’s trade or employment, and
needs to be excused or justified, I say that such a proposition in my opinion
has no solid foundation in reason to rest upon. A man’s right not to work or
not to pursue a particular trade or calling, or to determine when or where or
with whom he will work, is in law a right of precisely the same nature, and
entitled to just the same protection as a man’s right to trade or work. They
are but examples of that wider right of which I have already spoken. That
wider right embraces also the right of free speech. A man has a right to say
what he pleases, to induce, to advise, to exhort, to command, provided he does
not slander or deceive or commit any other of the wrongs known to the law of
which speech may be the medium. Unless he is thus shown to have abused his
right, why is he to be called upon to excuse or justify himself because his
words may interfere with some one else in his calling?</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>[After stating the case of Mogul Steamship Co. <em>v.</em> McGregor.]</p>

<p class='c019'>It was said that this was held lawful because the law sanctions acts which
are done in furtherance of trade competition. I do not think the decision
rests on so narrow a basis, but rather on this, that the acts by which the competition
was pursued were all lawful acts, that they were acts not in themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_948'>948</span>wrongful, but a mere exercise of the right to contract with whom, and when,
and under what circumstances and upon what conditions they pleased. I am
aware of no ground for saying that competition is regarded with special favor
by the law; at all events, I see no reason why it should be so regarded. It may
often press as hardly on individuals as the defendant’s acts are alleged to have
done in the present case. But if the alleged exception could be established,
why is not the present case within it? What was the object of the defendant,
and the workmen he represented, but to assist themselves in their competition
with the shipwrights? A man is entitled to take steps to compete to the best
advantage in the employment of his labor, and to shut out, if he can, what he
regards as unfair competition, just as much as if he was carrying on the business
of a shipowner. The inducement the appellant used to further his end
was the prospect that the members of his union would not work in company
with what they deemed unfair rivals in their calling. What is the difference
between this case and that of a union of shipowners who induce merchants not
to enter into contracts with the plaintiffs, by the prospect that if at any time
they employ the plaintiffs’ ships they will suffer the penalty of being made to
pay higher charges than their neighbors at the time when the defendants’
ships alone visit the ports? In my opinion there is no difference in principle
between the two cases.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Lord Macnaghten.</span> My Lords, I am sorry to say that I must begin by
recapitulating the facts of the case. For the findings of the jury, taken by
themselves, do not convey to my mind any definite meaning. The jury have
found that the appellant Allen “maliciously induced” the Glengall Iron Company
to discharge the respondents from their service, and they have awarded
damages in consequence. I do not know what the jury meant by the word
“induced;” I am not sure that I know what they meant by the word “maliciously.”
Sometimes, indeed, I rather doubt whether I quite understand that
unhappy expression myself. I am therefore compelled to turn for help to
the evidence at the trial, accepting, as I suppose the jury must have accepted,
the account given by the respondents in preference to that offered by the
appellant wherever there may be any shadow of difference between them.</p>

<p class='c019'>[After a full statement of the evidence.]</p>

<p class='c019'>Now before I proceed to consider the legal grounds on which Kennedy, J.,
and the Court of Appeal decided the case against Allen, I should like to ask
what there was wrong in Allen’s conduct. He had nothing to do with the
origin of the ill-feeling against Flood and Taylor. He did nothing to increase
it. He went to the dock simply because he was sent for by one of the men of
his union. It seems to be considered the duty of a district delegate to listen
to the grievances of the members of his union within his district, and to settle
the difficulty if possible. The jury found that the settlement of this dispute
was a matter within Allen’s discretion. The only way in which he could settle
it was by going and seeing the manager. There was surely nothing wrong
in that. There was nothing wrong in his telling the manager that the iron-men
would leave their work unless the two shipwrights against whom they
had a grudge were dismissed, if he really believed that that was what his
men intended to do. As far as their employers were concerned, the iron-men
were perfectly free to leave their work for any reason, or for no reason, or
even for a bad reason; any one of them might have gone singly to the manager,
or they might have gone to him all together (if they went quietly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_949'>949</span>peaceably), and told him that they would not stay any longer with Flood and
Taylor at work among them.</p>

<p class='c019'>If so, it is difficult to see why fault should be found with Allen for going in
their place and on their behalf and saying what they would have said themselves.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>As regards the meaning of the word “induce,” I do not think the jury got
much assistance. I rather gather from the summing-up that the jury were
given to understand that if they thought that Allen merely represented the
state of things as it was—and the feeling of the iron-men at the Regent’s
Dock—they would be at liberty to answer the questions put to them about
Allen in the negative. But the answer must be the other way if they thought
that Allen went further, and assumed to represent the union, and to speak as
if he had the power of the union at his back; that would be a threat and
would amount to “inducing.” Now, I must say that I do not think it can be
said that Allen did “induce” the company to discharge the plaintiffs. Certainly
it cannot be truly said that he procured them to be discharged. It was
not his act that prevented the company from continuing to employ them. If
the whole story had been a fiction and an invention on his part I could have
understood the finding of the jury. But I do not think there was any misrepresentation
on Allen’s part. I do not think there was any exaggeration.
Nor, indeed, was any such point made at the trial.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>So we see now, I think, what the findings of the jury come to, if they are to
be treated as being in accordance with the evidence. They must mean that
Allen induced the company to discharge the plaintiffs, by representing to the
manager, not otherwise than in accordance with the truth, the state of feeling
in the yard, and the intentions of the workmen, and that he did so “maliciously,”
because he must have known what the issue of his communication to
the manager would be, and naturally perhaps he was not sorry to see an
example made of persons obnoxious to his union. But is his conduct actionable?
It would be very singular if it were. No action would lie against the
company for discharging the two shipwrights. No action would lie against the
iron-men for striking against them. No action would lie against the officers of
the union for sanctioning such a strike. But if the respondents are right the
person to answer in damages is the man who happened to be the medium of
communication between the iron-men and the company,—the most innocent
of the three parties concerned, for he neither set the “agitation” on foot, nor
did he do anything to increase it, nor was his the order that put an end to the
connection between employer and employed. It seems to me that the result
would have been just the same if Edmonds had told Mr. Halkett what was
going on in the yard, or if Mr. Halkett had learned it from Flood and Taylor
themselves.</p>

<p class='c019'>Even if I am wrong in my view of the evidence and the verdict, if the verdict
amounts to a finding that Allen’s conduct was malicious in every sense of
the word, and that he procured the dismissal of Flood and Taylor, that is, that
it was his act and conduct alone which caused their dismissal, and if such a
verdict were warranted by the evidence, I should still be of opinion that judgment
was wrongly entered for the respondents. I do not think that there is
any foundation in good sense or in authority for the proposition that a person
who suffers loss by reason of another doing or not doing some act which that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_950'>950</span>other is entitled to do or to abstain from doing at his own will and pleasure,
whatever his real motive may be, has a remedy against a third person who, by
persuasion or some other means not in itself unlawful, has brought about the
act or omission from which the loss comes, even though it could be proved that
such person was actuated by malice towards the plaintiff, and that his conduct,
if it could be inquired into, was without justification or excuse.</p>

<p class='c019'>The case may be different where the act itself to which the loss is traceable
involves some breach of contract or some breach of duty, and amounts to an
interference with legal rights. There the immediate agent is liable, and it
may well be that the person in the background who pulls the strings is liable
too, though it is not necessary in the present case to express any opinion on
that point.</p>

<p class='c019'>But if the immediate agent cannot be made liable, though he knows what
he is about, and what the consequences of his action will be, it is difficult to
see on what principle a person less directly connected with the affair can be
made responsible unless malice has the effect of converting an act not in itself
illegal or improper into an actionable wrong. But if that is the effect of malice,
why is the immediate agent to escape? Above all, why is he to escape
when there is no one else to blame and no one else answerable? And yet
many cases may be put of harm done out of malice without any remedy being
available at law. Suppose a man takes a transfer of a debt with which he has
no concern for the purpose of ruining the debtor, and then makes him bankrupt
out of spite, and so intentionally causes him to lose some benefit under a
will or settlement,—suppose a man declines to give a servant a character because
he is offended with the servant for leaving,—suppose a person of position
takes away his custom from a country tradesman in a small village merely
to injure him on account of some fancied grievance not connected with their
dealings in the way of buying and selling,—no one, I think, would suggest
that there could be any remedy at law in any of those cases. But suppose a
customer, not content with taking away his own custom, says something not
slanderous or otherwise actionable or even improper in itself to induce a friend
of his not to employ the tradesman any more. Neither the one nor the other
is liable for taking away his own custom. Is it possible that the one can be
made liable for inducing the other not to employ the person against whom he
has a grudge? If so, a fashionable dressmaker might now and then, I fancy,
be plaintiff in a very interesting suit. The truth is, that questions of this sort
belong to the province of morals rather than to the province of law. Against
spite and malice the best safeguards are to be found in self-interest and public
opinion. Much more harm than good would be done by encouraging or
permitting inquiries into motives when the immediate act alleged to have
caused the loss for which redress is sought is in itself innocent or neutral in
character, and one which anybody may do or leave undone without fear of
legal consequences. Such an inquisition would, I think, be intolerable, to say
nothing of the probability of injustice being done by juries in a class of cases
in which there would be ample room for speculation and wide scope for
prejudice.</p>

<p class='c019'>In order to prevent any possible misconstruction of the language I have
used, I should like to add that in my opinion the decision of this case can have
no bearing on any case which involves the element of oppressive combination.
The vice of that form of terrorism commonly known by the name of “boycotting,”
and other forms of oppressive combination, seems to me to depend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_951'>951</span>on considerations which are, I think, in the present case, conspicuously
absent.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Lord Shand.</span>... The case was one of competition in labor, which, in
my opinion, is in all essentials analogous to competition in trade, and to which
the same principles must apply; and I ask myself what would be the thought
of the application of the word “malicious” to the conduct of a tradesman who
induces the customer of another tradesman to cease making purchases from
one with whom he had long dealt, and instead to deal with him, a rival in
trade. The case before the jury was, in my view, in no way different, except
that in the one case there was competition in labor,—in the other there would
be competition in trade.</p>

<p class='c019'>Some of the learned consulted judges speak of Allen’s conduct as having
been caused by a desire to inflict “punishment” on the shipwrights for past
acts, and indicate that, if the shipwrights had been actually working at ironwork
on the vessel at the time, the case would have been different.<a id='r601'></a><a href='#f601' class='c015'><sup>[601]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>I cannot agree in any such view. “Punishment” in a wide and popular
sense may possibly be used, though incorrectly, to describe the boilermakers’
action; but it is quite clear that what they were resolved to do, and really did,
was, while marking their sense of the injury which they thought (rightly or
wrongly is not the question) the shipwrights were doing to them in trenching
on their proper lines of business, to take a practical measure in their own defence.
Their object was to benefit themselves in their own business as working
boilermakers, and to prevent a recurrence in the future of what they considered
an improper invasion on their special department of work. How this
could possibly be regarded as “malicious,” even in any secondary sense that
can reasonably be attributed to that term, I cannot see.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c019'>Coming now directly to the merits of the question in controversy in the
case, the argument of the plaintiffs and the reasons for the opinions of the majority
of the consulted judges seem to me to fail, because, although it is no
doubt true that the plaintiffs were entitled to pursue their trade as workmen
“without hindrance,” their right to do so was qualified by an equal right, and
indeed the same right, on the part of other workmen. The hindrance must
not be of an unlawful character. It must not be by unlawful action. Amongst
the rights of all workmen is the right of competition. In the like manner and
to the same extent as a workman has a right to pursue his work or labor without
hindrance, a trader has a right to trade without hindrance. That right is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_952'>952</span>subject to the right of others to trade also, and to subject him to competition,—competition
which is in itself lawful, and which cannot be complained of
where no unlawful means (in the sense I have already explained) have been
employed. The matter has been settled in so far as competition in trade is
concerned by the judgment of this House in the Mogul Steamship Co. Case,
[1892] A. C. 25. I can see no reason for saying that a different principle
should apply to competition in labor. In the course of such competition, and
with a view to secure an advantage to himself, I can find no reason for saying
that a workman is not within his legal rights in resolving that he will decline
to work in the same employment with certain other persons, and in intimating
that resolution to his employers.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was an action tried before FitzGibbon, L. J., at the Belfast
Summer Assizes, 1896, brought against the defendants for damages
for maliciously and wrongfully procuring certain persons to break
contracts into which they had entered with the plaintiff, and not to
enter into other contracts with the plaintiff; and for maliciously and
wrongfully enticing and procuring certain workmen in the employment

<p class='c007'>The following facts were proved. The plaintiff was a butcher at
Lisburn, in the county of Antrim, about eight miles from Belfast,
where he had carried on business for a number of years. He had in
his employment one Robert Dickie, his foreman, who had been with
him for ten years. The plaintiff had been in the habit of sending
large quantities of meat to Andrew Munce, a butcher in Belfast, and
had been doing so for some twenty years. There was no contract in
writing between them; but, whatever amount the plaintiff sent,
Munce took and paid for—the amount being, on an average, of the
value of £30 a week.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants John Craig, John Davey, and Joseph Quinn were
butchers’ assistants in Belfast; and the defendants, Henry Dornan
and Robert Shaw, butchers’ assistants in Lisburn. In the spring of
1895 these defendants and several others in the same occupation
formed themselves into an association, which was duly registered under
the Trade Union Acts, 1871 and 1876, under the title of “The
Belfast Journeymen Butchers’ Assistants’ Association,” of which the
defendant Davey became the Secretary. The plaintiff’s men were not
members of the association. At the commencement of July, 1895, the
defendants’ association required the plaintiff to dismiss Robert Dickie
from his employment, which he refused to do. Upon that the defendants’
society threatened to withdraw the plaintiff’s men from his
service. A deputation was sent down to meet the plaintiff at Lisburn,
and a meeting was held in Magill’s public-house, Lisburn, on the 9th
July, at which the defendants Craig, Quinn, Dornan, and Shaw were
present—Craig being in the chair. The plaintiff stated that he had
come on behalf of his men, and was ready to pay all fines and demands
against them, and asked to have them admitted into the society. The
defendant Shaw objected, and said that the plaintiff’s men should be
punished, and should be put out to walk the streets for twelve months.
The plaintiff objected to this, as Dickie was a married man with a
family. Shaw moved, and Morgan seconded a resolution that the
plaintiff’s assistants should be called out, and it was carried. The
defendants stated that they could pick out plenty of men to work for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_954'>954</span>the plaintiff from their list; the plaintiff replied that they were not
suitable for his business, and refused to put his own men out. Craig
then said that the plaintiff’s meat would be stopped at Munce’s, if the
plaintiff would not comply with their wishes. The plaintiff still refused.
The defendants then called out some of the plaintiff’s employees.
Edward Dickie, a servant of the plaintiff, was brought to a
meeting of the defendants’ society, held over Dornan’s shop in Lisburn,
and was ordered to leave the plaintiff, the society undertaking
to pay him the same wages as he had been receiving from the plaintiff.
Dickie, yielding to this order, left the plaintiff without notice. “Black
lists” were issued by the society upon which the names of persons were
posted who had offended against the society’s rules. Leathem’s name
was posted, and also the name of John M’Bride, a flesher in Lisburn,
who was dealing with the plaintiff. Subsequently, however, Dornan
and others of the defendants came to M’Bride; and on his undertaking
not to deal any more with Leathem, his name was struck out.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 6th September, 1895, the defendant Davey wrote to the
plaintiff the following letter:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been instructed to write you if you would be kind enough
to reply on or before Tuesday, 10th, whether you have made up your
mind to continue to employ non-union labour. If you continue as at
present, our society will be obliged to adopt extreme measures in your
case. Trusting that you will see the wisdom of acceding to our views
at once, I remain,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 13th September, Davey wrote to Munce:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“A deputation has been appointed to wait on you, or your responsible
representative, on Monday evening, the 16th inst., at 6.30 p. m.,
to come to a decision in regard to this case of Leathem &amp; Sons, as we
are anxious to have a settlement at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To this Munce replied:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“In reply to your letter <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">re</span></i> Leathem &amp; Sons, I cannot see my way
to attend any deputation of the sort, as it is quite out of my province
to interfere with the liberty of any man. But why refer to me in this
matter? I do not think it fair for you to come at me in the matter,
seeing it appears to be the Messrs. Leathem that you wish to interfere
with.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 16th September a deputation of the defendants’ society went
to Munce’s establishment, and had an interview with W. F. Munce,
the son of Andrew Munce, and asked him to put pressure on his
father to stop dealing with the plaintiff. W. F. Munce replied by
letter on the 17th September:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“A deputation of the Journeymen Butchers’ Association waited at
Corn Market yesterday evening, with reference to the case of the purchase
of meat from Henry Leathem, Lisburn. In accordance with
promise, I placed the views of the deputation before Mr. Munce, and
in reply he wishes to state he could not interfere to bring pressure to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_955'>955</span>bear on Mr. Leathem to employ none but society men, by refusing to
purchase meat from him, as that would be outside his province, and
would be interfering with the liberty of another man; but at the same
time he will strongly recommend Mr. Leathem to adopt the views of
the Journeymen Butchers’ Association, and employ men belonging to
the society.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 18th September Davey wrote to Andrew Munce:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have submitted your letter to committee. They are of opinion
that in the main it is unsatisfactory, but thanking you kindly for your
recommendation to Mr. Leathem, with whom we have endeavoured to
make a satisfactory arrangement, but have failed; so therefore have
no other alternative but to instruct your employees to cease work immediately
Leathem’s beef arrives.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 19th September Munce telegraphed to Leathem:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unless you arrange with society you need not send any beef this
week, as men are ordered to quit work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Munce ceased to deal with the plaintiff, and the plaintiff was obliged
to sell off the meat he had on hand at a heavy loss at any price he could
get. In consequence of these transactions the plaintiff’s business was
ruined.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case was tried before FitzGibbon, L. J., at the Summer Assizes
of 1896, at Belfast. The defendants did not offer any evidence, their
counsel asking for a direction on the grounds: 1, that to sustain the
action a contract made with Leathem must be proved to have been
made and broken through the acts of the defendants, and that there
was no evidence of such contract or breach; 2, that there was no evidence
of pecuniary damage to the plaintiff through the acts of the
defendants; 3, that the ends of the defendants and the means taken
by them to promote those ends as appearing in evidence were legitimate,
and there was no evidence of actual damage to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned Lord Justice declined to withdraw the case from the
jury, and left to them the following questions:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Did the defendants, or any of them, wrongfully and maliciously
induce the customers or servants of the plaintiff named in the evidence
to refuse to deal with the plaintiff? <em>Answer</em>: Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Did the defendants, or any two or more of them maliciously
conspire to induce the plaintiff’s customers or servants named in the
evidence, or any of them, not to deal with the plaintiff or not to continue
in his employment; and were such persons so induced not so to
do? <em>Answer</em>: Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Did the defendants Davey, Dornan, and Shaw, or any of them,
publish the “black lists” with intent to injure the plaintiff in his
business; and, if so, did the publication so injure him? <em>Answer</em>. Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>FitzGibbon, L. J., in summing up, told the jury that pecuniary loss,
directly caused by the conduct of the defendants, must be proved in
order to establish a cause of action; and he advised them to require
<span class='pageno' id='Page_956'>956</span>to be satisfied that such loss to a substantial amount had been proved
by the plaintiff. He declined to tell them that, if actual and substantial
pecuniary loss was proved to have been directly caused to the
plaintiff by the wrongful acts of the defendants, they were bound to
limit the amount of damages to the precise sum so proved. He told
them that, if the plaintiff gave the proof of actual and substantial loss
necessary to maintain the action, they were at liberty in assessing
damages to take all the circumstances of the case, including the conduct
of the defendants, reasonably into account. The Lord Justice
did not tell the jury that the liability of the defendants depended on
any question of law. He told them that the questions left to them
were questions of fact to be determined on the evidence; but that
they included questions as to the intent of the defendants, and, in
particular, their intent to injure the plaintiff in his trade as distinguished
from the intent of legitimately advancing their own interests.
The Lord Justice did not tell the jury that the defendants could be
directly asked what their own intention was, but he did tell them that
their intention was to be inferred from their acts and conduct as
proved, and that, in acting upon the evidence given by the plaintiff,
they were at liberty to have regard to the fact that the defendants,
who might have given the best evidence on the subject, had not been
produced to explain, qualify, or contradict any of the evidence given
for the plaintiff as to their own acts. Upon the meaning of the words
“wrongfully and maliciously” in the questions, the Lord Justice told
the jury that they had to consider whether the intent and actions of
the defendants went beyond the limits which would not be actionable,
namely, securing or advancing their own interests, or those of their
trade, by reasonable means, including lawful combination, or whether
their acts, as proved, were intended and calculated to injure the plaintiff
in his trade, through a combination and with a common purpose,
to prevent the free action of his customers and servants in dealing with
him, with the effect of actually injuring him, as distinguished from
acts legitimately done to secure or advance their own interests.
Finally, he told the jury that acts done with the object of increasing
the profits or raising the wages of any combination of persons such as
the society to which the defendants belonged, whether employers or
employed, by reasonable and legitimate means, were perfectly lawful
and were not actionable so long as no wrongful act was maliciously—that
is intentionally—done to injure a third party. To constitute
such a wrongful act for the purposes of this case, the Lord Justice told
the jury that they must be satisfied that there had been a conspiracy,
a common intention, and a combination, on the part of the defendants
to injure the plaintiff in his business; and that acts must be proved to
have been done by the defendants in furtherance of that intention
which had inflicted actual money loss upon the plaintiff in his trade;
and that whether the acts of the defendants were or were not in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_957'>957</span>sense actionable, was the question which the jury had to try upon the
evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury found for the plaintiff with £250 damages, of which £50
was separately assessed for damages on the cause of action relating to
the “black list,” and £200 for damages on the other causes of action
and judgment was thereupon entered for the plaintiff for £250 damages
and costs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants now moved to set aside the verdict and judgment so
had, and that judgment should be entered for them on the ground of
misdirection; or for a new trial, on the ground that the damages were
excessive, and that the jury were allowed to take the “black lists”
into account.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>William O’Brien, J.</span>...</p>

<p class='c007'>The right infringed is the right to live by labor.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>Physical hindrances, or prevention of labor by physical means, it
was conceded, would be the invasion of a right, and that would certainly
be the case whether the restraint was applied to the employer
or to the workman.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>If temporal loss were not coercion, it could be used to the degree of
a person being starved. The proposition on which the judgment of
the majority (in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood) was founded in this respect is opposed
to the whole analogy of the law that makes duress of property,
or menace of temporal loss, as effectual as physical violence to avoid
all kinds of acts.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>In The Mogul Steamship Company <em>v.</em> M’Gregor, [1892] A. C. 25,
the trade of the defendants was the primary object, and the injury to
the plaintiffs was the result of the means taken to advance that object.
There, as in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, the injury to others was
the thing intended, as the means of carrying out another object.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>There is an observation which appears to me to gather up several
of the fallacies which are scattered through the arguments in the judgments
of the majority in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1. The case is
put by Lord Watson as if it were a question whether a person could
be made liable for doing, from a malicious motive, what, without such
motive he could do lawfully. In fact there are cases in law in which
the malice makes the distinction of what is lawful or unlawful, as in
malicious prosecution, or takes away the right that otherwise exists, as
in the instance of privileged communication. But that is not the present
case at all, as it was not that of Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1.
The defendant, who maliciously instigated the thing, is not the person
who possessed the power of dismissal. Therefore the supposed constitutional
objection, that the law could not enter into a man’s mind, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_958'>958</span>no place. The same point meets the case of the butler and the cook
that was put in the argument. The butler tells his master he will
leave unless the cook is dismissed. Lord Herschell snatched at the
admission of counsel, that the cook could bring an action, as being the
logical conclusion from his argument. With great respect, it is neither
logical nor the law. The servant is the master of his own actions.
He can choose his own company, though even for that object he cannot
use threats. But in this case it was another person that assumed
to choose his company for him. Allen was not a boiler-maker, as Craig
was not a butcher, who wished to leave. Each was a member of a
trade organization, and had no duty or interest of his own to interfere.
What relation could such a position assume but that of intimidation?</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>... a confusion of relations, in applying the proposition that a
person cannot be made liable for maliciously exercising a right which
he possesses. The action here is for maliciously causing another person
to exercise a right which that other person possessed. In one case,
the right may be said to absorb the malice, though there are exceptions
to the rule in the common law. But how can it absorb another
man’s malice?</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>What wrong can be conceived more cruel and grievous than wilfully
depriving men of their employment? There must be a right, correlative
to the wrong. What right can be more sacred than the right to
live by a man’s labor? But then, it is said, the wrong and the right
are subject to the legal power of another person. That is the case in
many instances, in which the law nevertheless gives a remedy for
wrong that requires the exercise of another person’s will. That is the
case of a person who is defamed; the damage comes from those who
hear. That is the case of malicious prosecution; the agency is that
of the law. The servant who is enticed away from his master, leaves
of his own will. The woman who left her husband, in Winsmore <em>v.</em>
Greenbank, Willes, 577, did so with her own consent; the actress who
broke her engagement, in Lumley <em>v.</em> Gye, 2 E. &amp; B. 216, could have
performed, if she liked. That is the case of tenants leaving their
holdings on account of threats, which is put in 1 Rolle’s Abridgment,
108; Action sur Case, (N.) pl. 21.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many other examples could be given where the law allows a remedy,
though the wrongful act requires the concurrence of another person’s
will. The rule is the same as to crimes. The law does not excuse
instigation to crime because the other person need not commit the
crime, or for the reason that it is impossible to separate the effect of
the instigation and natural pravity of will, which was the ground
erroneously assigned by Coleridge, J., for his opinion in Lumley <em>v.</em>
Gye, 2 E. &amp; B. 216. In fact the law makes no distinction between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_959'>959</span>moral and physical agency, or the degrees of the influence, when the
cause is attached to the consequence by the verdict of the jury.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The law of conspiracy, which is traced down, in Comyn’s Digest,
and after him in the notes to Saunders’ Reports, and in several English
judgments as well as in the judgment in Kearney <em>v.</em> Lloyd, 26
L. R. Ir. 268, from the obsolete writ of conspiracy, through the action
on the case in the nature of conspiracy, with their several distinctions,
and which was originally confined to false accusations of crime, has
widened out by the expansion of social conditions and the increase of
wickedness, until it embraces in its modern extent every kind of wrong
committed by several against another, and has been applied in a multitude
of instances where the law gives no remedy against an individual,
which was the utmost that was determined by Allen <em>v.</em> Flood,
[1898] A. C. 1.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>... a malicious design to deprive a person of his livelihood, the
malice being compounded both of the object, and the want of any
just motive of personal right. For no one contended at any time
that the object of drawing all persons into the pen of a trade union,
was a ground of privilege like that which excused the act in The
Mogul Steamship Co. <em>v.</em> M’Gregor, [1892] A. C. 25, where the defendants
merely waged a war of rivalry in their trade. However, if “civil
wrong” be understood in the sense of actionable wrong, the rule, so
confined, is contrary to a multitude of cases, in which the action was
adopted, and in which nevertheless it is most certain there was no legal
remedy against a single defendant, even before the decision of Allen
<em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1. Indeed, that is the express and special use
of the action of conspiracy, without which it would find no real place
in practice, though it is not impossible such an action could be maintained
for what is actionable also in the case of an individual.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>There was in this case a direct design to injure the plaintiff. That
was malice alone. The act was not done in exercise of any right the
defendants possessed. It was done through the agency of another person
by improperly influencing his will; and that will was moved
solely by their act, and would not otherwise have been exercised. It
was done by numbers, to which the law attaches a new and altered
quality of more formidable wrong—the foundation of conspiracy—which
is a difference in things themselves that can never be taken
out of the law, civil or criminal, whilst there is a difference between a
man and an army. Lastly, there was the damage which was so unjust
as itself to make the act malicious.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>For the case put, of a person maliciously digging on his own land,
and draining the well, of his neighbor, is no exception, and demonstrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_960'>960</span>the weakness of the argument which is founded on it. In that
case the act could not be prohibited without interfering with the inherent
right of property; and the right of the neighbor was subject
to the right of the contiguous owner. The two rights were equal.
The right absorbed the malice, and could not otherwise coexist with
it. Here the defendants possessed no right which they could not
otherwise exercise; and the right of the plaintiff to carry on his trade
was not subject to any right in them. No right of interference with
others, which the law could recognize, could attach to the aggressions
of a trade union—to their plans for the revision of the relations between
employers and employed—to proceedings conducting, by inevitable
sequence, to what was lately expressed, with no less energy
than the weight attaching to the author, as “the destructive demands
of a class upon the fundamental laws on which civil order rests.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Sir P. O’Brien, L. C. J.</span>, and <span class='sc'>Andrews, J.</span>, delivered opinions in
favor of denying defendants’ motion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Palles, C. B.</span>, dissented, because he felt himself “coerced by the
judgment of the House of Lords in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood....”</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants’ motion was refused with costs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case was then carried to the Irish Court of Appeal. In accordance
with the opinions there delivered by <span class='sc'>Lord Ashbourne, Chancellor</span>,
<span class='sc'>Porter, M. R.</span>, <span class='sc'>Walker, L. J.</span>, and <span class='sc'>Holmes, L. J.</span>, the
decision below, as to the verdict and judgment for £200, was affirmed
with costs; the judgment for the plaintiff being amended by omitting
the part as to the recovery of £50 damages which was separately assessed
on account of the “black list.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Holmes, L. J.</span>, said: “The ‘black list’ was only an overt act of the
conspiracy, and the sum awarded for it is included in the £200.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the defendants, Quinn, appealed to the House of Lords.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Chancellor Halsbury</span>, <span class='sc'>Lords Macnaghten</span>, <span class='sc'>Shand</span>,
<span class='sc'>Brampton</span>, <span class='sc'>Robertson</span>, and <span class='sc'>Lindley</span> delivered opinions in favor of
dismissing the appeal.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Earl of Halsbury, L. C.</span></p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>[As to the effect of the decision in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood.]</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the hypothesis of fact upon which Allen <em>v.</em> Flood was decided
by a majority in this House was that the defendant there neither uttered
nor carried into effect any threat at all: he simply warned the
plaintiff’s employers of what the men themselves, without his persuasion
or influence, had determined to do, and it was certainly proved
that no resolution of the trade union had been arrived at at all, and
that the trade union official had no authority himself to call out the
men, which in that case was argued to be the threat which coerced the
employers to discharge the plaintiff. It was further an element in
the decision that there was no case of conspiracy or even combination.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_961'>961</span>What was alleged to be done was only the independent and single action
of the defendant, actuated in what he did by the desire to express
his own views in favor of his fellow-members. It is true that I personally
did not believe that was the true view of the facts, but, as I
have said, we must look at the hypothesis of fact upon which the case
was decided by the majority of those who took part in the decision.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Macnaghten.</span></p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>I do not think that the acts done by the defendants were done “in
contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute between employers
and workmen.” So far as I can see, there was no trade dispute at
all. Leathem had no difference with his men. They had no quarrel
with him. For his part he was quite willing that all his men should
join the union. He offered to pay their fines and entrance moneys.
What he objected to was a cruel punishment proposed to be inflicted
on some of his men for not having joined the union sooner. There was
certainly no trade dispute in the case of Munce. But the defendants
conspired to do harm to Munce in order to compel him to do harm to
Leathem, and so enable them to wreak their vengeance on Leathem’s
servants who were not members of the union.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lord Lindley.</span><a id='r604'></a><a href='#f604' class='c015'><sup>[604]</sup></a> My Lords, the case of Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C.
1, has so important a bearing on the present appeal that it is necessary
to ascertain exactly what this House really decided in that celebrated
case. It was an action by two workmen of an iron company
against three members of a trade union, namely, Allen and two others,
for maliciously, wrongfully, and with intent to injure the plaintiffs,
procuring and inducing the iron company to discharge the plaintiffs.<a id='r605'></a><a href='#f605' class='c015'><sup>[605]</sup></a>
The action was tried before Kennedy, J., who ruled that there was
no evidence to go to the jury of conspiracy, intimidation, coercion, or
breach of contract. The result of the trial was that the plaintiffs obtained
a verdict and judgment against Allen alone. He appealed, and
the only question which this House had to determine was whether
what he had done entitled the plaintiffs to maintain their action
against him. What the jury found that he had done was, that he had
maliciously induced the employers of the plaintiffs to discharge them,
whereby the plaintiffs suffered damage. Different views were taken
by the noble Lords who heard the appeal as to Allen’s authority to
call out the members of the union, and also as to the means used by
Allen to induce the employers of the plaintiffs to discharge them;
but, in the opinion of the noble Lords who formed the majority of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_962'>962</span>Your Lordships’ House, all that Allen did was to inform the employers
of the plaintiffs that most of their workmen would leave them if they
did not discharge the plaintiffs.<a id='r606'></a><a href='#f606' class='c015'><sup>[606]</sup></a> There being no question of conspiracy,
intimidation, coercion, or breach of contract, for consideration
by the House, and the majority of their Lordships having come to the
conclusion that Allen had done no more than I have stated, the majority
of the noble Lords held that the action against Allen would not
lie; that he had infringed no right of the plaintiffs; that he had done
nothing which he had no legal right to do, and that the fact that he
had acted maliciously and with intent to injure the plaintiffs did not,
without more, entitle the plaintiffs to maintain the action.</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, this decision, as I understand it, establishes two propositions:
one a far-reaching and extremely important proposition of
law, and the other a comparatively unimportant proposition of mixed
law and fact, useful as a guide, but of a very different character from
the first.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first and important proposition is that an act otherwise lawful,
although harmful, does not become actionable by being done maliciously
in the sense of proceeding from a bad motive, and with intent
to annoy or harm another. This is a legal doctrine not new or laid
down for the first time in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1; it had been
gaining ground for some time, but it was never before so fully and
authoritatively expounded as in that case. In applying this proposition
care, however, must be taken to bear in mind, first, that in
Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, criminal responsibility had not to be
considered. It would revolutionize criminal law to say that the criminal
responsibility for conduct never depends on intention. Secondly,
it must be borne in mind that even in considering a person’s liability
to civil proceedings the proposition in question only applies to “acts
otherwise lawful,” i. e., to acts involving no breach of duty, or, in other
words, no wrong to any one. I shall refer to this matter later on.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second proposition is that what Allen did infringed no right of
the plaintiffs, even although he acted maliciously and with a view to
injure them. I have already stated what he did, and all that he did,
in the opinion of the majority of the noble Lords. If their view of
the facts was correct, their conclusion that Allen infringed no right
of the plaintiffs is perfectly intelligible, and indeed unavoidable.
Truly, to inform a person that others will annoy or injure him unless
he acts in a particular way cannot of itself be actionable, whatever the
motive or intention of the informant may have been.</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, the questions whether Allen had more power over the
men than some of their Lordships thought, and whether Allen did
more than they thought, are mere questions of fact. Neither of these
questions is a question of law, and no court or jury, is bound as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_963'>963</span>matter of law to draw from the facts before it inferences of fact similar
to those drawn by noble Lords from the evidence relating to Allen in
the case before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will pass now to the facts of this case, and consider (1) what the
plaintiff’s rights were; (2) what the defendants’ conduct was; (3),
whether that conduct infringed the plaintiff’s rights. For the sake of
clearness it will be convenient to consider these questions in the first
place apart from the statute which legalizes strikes, and in the next
place with reference to that statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. As to the plaintiff’s rights. He had the ordinary rights of a
British subject. He was at liberty to earn his own living in his own
way, provided he did not violate some special law prohibiting him
from so doing, and provided he did not infringe the rights of other
people. This liberty involved liberty to deal with other persons who
were willing to deal with him. This liberty is a right recognized by
law; its correlative is the general duty of every one not to prevent
the free exercise of this liberty, except so far as his own liberty of
action may justify him in so doing. But a person’s liberty or right
to deal with others is nugatory, unless they are at liberty to deal with
him if they choose to do so. Any interference with their liberty to
deal with him affects him. If such interference is justifiable in point
of law, he has no redress. Again, if such interference is wrongful,
the only person who can sue in respect of it is, as a rule, the person
immediately affected by it; another who suffers by it has usually no
redress; the damage to him is too remote, and it would be obviously
practically impossible and highly inconvenient to give legal redress to
all who suffered from such wrongs. But if the interference is wrongful
and is intended to damage a third person, and he is damaged in
fact—in other words, if he is wrongfully and intentionally struck at
through others, and is thereby damnified—the whole aspect of the
case is changed: the wrong done to others reaches him, his rights are
infringed although indirectly, and damage to him is not remote or unforeseen,
but is the direct consequence of what has been done. Our
law, as I understand it, is not so defective as to refuse him a remedy
by an action under such circumstances. The cases collected in the
old books on actions on the case, and the illustrations given by the late
Bowen, L. J., in his admirable judgment in the Mogul Steamship
Company’s Case, 23 Q. B. D. 613, 614, may be referred to in support
of the foregoing conclusion, and I do not understand the decision in
Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, to be opposed to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the above reasoning is correct, Lumley <em>v.</em> Gye, 2 E. &amp; B. 216, was
rightly decided, as I am of opinion it clearly was. Further, the principle
involved in it cannot be confined to inducements to break contracts
of service, nor indeed to inducements to break any contracts.
The principle which underlies the decision reaches all wrongful acts
done intentionally to damage a particular individual and actually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_964'>964</span>damaging him. Temperton <em>v.</em> Russell, [1893] 1 Q. B. 715, ought to
have been decided and may be upheld on this principle. That case was
much criticised in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, and not without
reason; for, according to the judgment of Lord Esher, the defendants’
liability depended on motive or intention alone, whether anything
wrong was done or not. This went too far, as was pointed out in
Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1. But in Temperton <em>v.</em> Russell, [1893]
1 Q. B. 715, there was a wrongful act, namely, conspiracy and unjustifiable
interference with Brentano, who dealt with the plaintiff. This
wrongful act warranted the decision, which I think was right.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. I pass on to consider what the defendants did. The appellant
and two of the other defendants were the officers of a trade union, and
the jury have found that the defendants wrongfully and maliciously
induced the customers of the plaintiff to refuse to deal with him, and
maliciously conspired to induce them not to deal with him. There
were similar findings as to inducing servants of the plaintiff to leave
him. What the defendants did was to threaten to call out the union
workmen of the plaintiff and of his customers if he would not discharge
some non-union men in his employ. In other words, in order
to compel the plaintiff to discharge some of his men, the defendants
threatened to put the plaintiff and his customers, and persons lawfully
working for them, to all the inconvenience they could without using
violence. The defendants’ conduct was the more reprehensible because
the plaintiff offered to pay the fees necessary to enable his non-union
men to become members of the defendants’ union; but this
would not satisfy the defendants. The facts of this case are entirely
different from those which this House had to consider in Allen <em>v.</em>
Flood, [1898] A. C. 1. In the present case there was no dispute between
the plaintiff and his men. None of them wanted to leave his
employ. Nor was there any dispute between the plaintiff’s customers
and their own men, nor between the plaintiff and his customers, nor
between the men they respectively employed. The defendants called
no witnesses, and there was no evidence to justify or excuse the conduct
of the defendants. That they acted as they did in furtherance
of what they considered the interests of union men may probably be
fairly assumed in their favor, although they did not come forward
and say so themselves; but that is all that can be said for them. No
one can, I think, say that the verdict was not amply warranted by
the evidence. I have purposely said nothing about the black list, as
the learned judge who tried the case considered that the evidence did
not connect the appellant with that list. But the black list was, in
my opinion, a very important feature in the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The remaining question is whether such conduct infringed the
plaintiff’s rights so as to give him a cause of action. In my opinion,
it plainly did. The defendants were doing a great deal more than exercising
their own rights: they were dictating to the plaintiff and his
customers and servants what they were to do. The defendants were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_965'>965</span>violating their duty to the plaintiff and his customers and servants,
which was to leave them in the undisturbed enjoyment of their liberty
of action as already explained. What is the legal justification or
excuse for such conduct? None is alleged and none can be found.
This violation of duty by the defendants resulted in damage to the
plaintiff—not remote, but immediate and intended. The intention
to injure the plaintiff negatives all excuses and disposes of any question
of remoteness of damage. Your lordships have to deal with a
case, not of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum absque injuria</span></i>, but of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum cum injuria</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every element necessary to give a cause of action on ordinary principles
of law is present in this case. As regards authorities, they were
all exhaustively examined in the Mogul Steamship Co. <em>v.</em> MacGregor,
[1892] A. C. 25, and Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, and it is unnecessary
to dwell upon them again. I have examined all those which are
important, and I venture to say that there is not a single decision
anterior to Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, in favor of the appellant.
His sheet anchor is Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, which is far from
covering this case, and which can only be made to cover it by greatly
extending its operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was contended at the bar that if what was done in this case had
been done by one person only, his conduct would not have been actionable,
and that the fact that what was done was affected by many
acting in concert makes no difference. My Lords, one man without
others behind him who would obey his orders could not have done
what these defendants did. One man exercising the same control over
others as these defendants had could have acted as they did, and, if
he had done so, I conceive that he would have committed a wrong
towards the plaintiff for which the plaintiff could have maintained an
action. I am aware that in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, Lord
Herschell, [1898] A. C. at pp. 128, 138, expressed his opinion to be
that it was immaterial whether Allen said he would call the men out
or not. This may have been so in that particular case, as there was
evidence that Allen had no power to call out the men, and the men
had determined to strike before Allen had anything to do with the
matter. But if Lord Herschell meant to say that as a matter of law
there is no difference between giving information that men will strike,
and making them strike, or threatening to make them strike, by calling
them out when they do not want to strike, I am unable to concur
with him. It is all very well to talk about peaceable persuasion. It
may be that in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, there was nothing more;
but here there was very much more. What may begin as peaceable
persuasion may easily become, and in trades union disputes generally
does become, peremptory ordering, with threats open or covert of
very unpleasant consequences to those who are not persuaded. Calling
workmen out involves very serious consequences to such of them
as do not obey. Black lists are real instruments of coercion, as every
man whose name is on one soon discovers to his cost. A combination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_966'>966</span>not to work is one thing, and is lawful. A combination to prevent
others from working by annoying them if they do is a very different
thing, and is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> unlawful. Again, not to work oneself is
lawful so long as one keeps off the poor-rates, but to order men not to
work when they are willing to work is another thing. A threat to call
men out given by a trade union official to an employer of men belonging
to the union and willing to work with him is a form of coercion,
intimidation, molestation, or annoyance to them and to him very difficult
to resist, and, to say the least, requiring justification. None was
offered in this case.</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, it is said that conduct which is not actionable on the
part of one person cannot be actionable if it is that of several acting
in concert. This may be so where many do no more than one is supposed
to do. But numbers may annoy and coerce where one may not.
Annoyance and coercion by many may be so intolerable as to become
actionable, and produce a result which one alone could not produce.
I am aware of the difficulties which surround the law of conspiracy
both in its criminal and civil aspects; and older views have been
greatly and, if I may say so, most beneficially modified by the discussions
and decisions in America and this country. Amongst the American
cases, I would refer especially to Vegelahn <em>v.</em> Guntner, 167 Mass.
92, where coercion by other means than violence, or threats of it, was
held unlawful. In this country it is now settled by the decision of this
House in the case of the Mogul Steamship Co., [1892] A. C. 25; 23
Q. B. D. 598, that no action for a conspiracy lies against persons who
act in concert to damage another and do damage him, but who at the
same time merely exercise their own rights and who infringe no rights
of other people. Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, emphasizes the same
doctrine. The principle was strikingly illustrated in the Scottish
Coöperative Society <em>v.</em> Glasgow Fleshers’ Association, 35 Sc. L. R.
645, which was referred to in the course of the argument. In this case
some butchers induced some salesmen not to sell meat to the plaintiffs.
The means employed were to threaten the salesmen that if they continued
to sell meat to the plaintiffs, they, the butchers, would not buy
from the salesmen. There was nothing unlawful in this, and the
learned judge held that the plaintiffs showed no cause of action, although
the butchers’ object was to prevent the plaintiffs from buying
for coöperative societies in competition with themselves, and the defendants
were acting in concert.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cardinal point of distinction between such cases and the present
is that in them, although damage was intentionally inflicted on the
plaintiffs, no one’s right was infringed—no wrongful act was committed;
whilst in the present case the coercion of the plaintiff’s
customers and servants, and of the plaintiff through them, was an
infringement of their liberty as well as his, and was wrongful both
to them and also to him, as I have already endeavored to show.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_967'>967</span>Intentional damage which arises from the mere exercise of the rights
of many is not, I apprehend, actionable by our law as now settled. To
hold the contrary would be unduly to restrict the liberty of one set
of persons in order to uphold the liberty of another set. According to
our law, competition, with all its drawbacks, not only between individuals,
but between associations, and between them and individuals,
is permissible, provided nobody’s rights are infringed. The law is
the same for all persons, whatever their callings: it applies to masters
as well as to men; the proviso, however, is all-important, and it also
applies to both, and limits the rights of those who combine to lock-out
as well as the rights of those who strike. But coercion by threats, open
or disguised, not only of bodily harm but of serious annoyance and
damage, is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i>, at all events, a wrong inflicted on the persons
coerced; and in considering whether coercion has been applied or not,
numbers cannot be disregarded.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>I conclude this part of the case by saying that, in my opinion, the
direction given to the jury by the learned judge who tried the case
was correct, so far as the liability of the defendants turns on principles
of common law, and that the objection taken to it by the counsel
for the appellant is untenable. I mean the objection that the learned
judge did not distinguish between coercion to break contracts of service,
and coercion to break contracts of other kinds, and coercion not
to enter into contracts.</p>

<p class='c007'>I pass now to consider the effect of the statute 38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 86.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The opinion on this point is omitted.]</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, I will detain your Lordships no longer. Allen <em>v.</em> Flood,
[1898] A. C. 1, is in many respects a very valuable decision, but it
may be easily misunderstood and carried too far.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your Lordships are asked to extend it and to destroy that individual
liberty which our laws so anxiously guard. The appellant seeks by
means of Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, and by logical reasoning based
upon some passages in the judgments given by the noble Lords who
decided it, to drive your Lordships to hold that boycotting by trades
unions in one of its most objectionable forms is lawful, and gives no
cause of action to its victims although they may be pecuniarily ruined
thereby.</p>

<p class='c007'>My Lords, so to hold would, in my opinion, be contrary to well-settled
principles of English law, and would be to do what is not yet
authorized by any statute or legal decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my opinion this appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The following decree was entered at a preliminary hearing upon
the bill: “This cause came on to be heard upon the plaintiff’s motion
for a temporary injunction; and after due hearing, at which the several
defendants, were represented by counsel, it is ordered, adjudged,
and decreed that an injunction issue <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pendente lite</span></i>, to remain in force
until the further order of this court, or of some justice thereof, restraining
the respondents and each and every of them, their agents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_969'>969</span>and servants, from interfering with the plaintiff’s business by patrolling
the sidewalk or street in front or in the vicinity of the premises
occupied by him, for the purpose of preventing any person or persons
who now are or may hereafter be in his employment, or desirous of
entering the same, from entering it, or continuing in it; or by obstructing
or interfering with such persons, or any others, in entering
or leaving the plaintiff’s said premises; or by intimidating, by threats
or otherwise, any person or persons who now are or may hereafter be
in the employment of the plaintiff, or desirous of entering the same,
from entering it, or continuing in it; or by any scheme or conspiracy
among themselves or with others, organized for the purpose of annoying,
hindering, interfering with, or preventing any person or persons
who now are or may hereafter be in the employment of the plaintiff,
or desirous of entering the same, from entering it, or from continuing
therein.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hearing upon the bill and answers before Holmes, J., who reported
the case for the consideration of the full court, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The facts admitted or proved are that, following upon a strike of
the plaintiff’s workmen, the defendants have conspired to prevent the
plaintiff from getting workmen, and thereby to prevent him from
carrying on his business unless and until he will adopt a schedule of
prices which has been exhibited to him, and for the purpose of compelling
him to accede to that schedule, but for no other purpose. If
he adopts that schedule he will not be interfered with further. The
means adopted for preventing the plaintiff from getting workmen are,
(1) in the first place, persuasion and social pressure. And these
means are sufficient to affect the plaintiff disadvantageously, although
it does not appear, if that be material, that they are sufficient to crush
him. I ruled that the employment of these means for the said purpose
was lawful, and for that reason refused an injunction against the
employment of them. If the ruling was wrong, I find that an injunction
ought to be granted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“(2) I find also, that, as a further means for accomplishing the
desired end, threats of personal injury or unlawful harm were conveyed
to persons seeking employment or employed, although no actual
violence was used beyond a technical battery, and although the threats
were a good deal disguised, and express words were avoided. It appeared
to me that there was danger of similar acts in the future. I
ruled that conduct of this kind should be enjoined.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The defendants established a patrol of two men in front of the
plaintiff’s factory, as one of the instrumentalities of their plan. The
patrol was changed every hour, and continued from half-past six in
the morning until half-past five in the afternoon, on one of the busy
streets of Boston. The number of men was greater at times, and at
times showed some little inclination to stop the plaintiff’s door, which
was not serious, but seemed to me proper to be enjoined. The patrol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_970'>970</span>proper at times went further than simple advice, not obtruded beyond
the point where the other person was willing to listen, and conduct of
that sort is covered by (2) above, but its main purpose was in aid of
the plan held lawful in (1) above. I was satisfied that there was probability
of the patrol being continued if not enjoined. I ruled that the
patrol, so far as it confined itself to persuasion and giving notice of the
strike, was not unlawful, and limited the injunction accordingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was some evidence of persuasion to break existing contracts.
I ruled that this was unlawful, and should be enjoined.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I made the final decree appended hereto. If, on the foregoing
facts, it ought to be reversed or modified, such decree is to be entered
as the full court may think proper; otherwise, the decree is to
stand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The final decree was as follows: “This cause came on to be heard,
and was argued by counsel; and thereupon, on consideration thereof,
it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the defendants, and each and
every of them, their agents and servants, be restrained and enjoined
from interfering with the plaintiff’s business by obstructing or physically
interfering with any persons in entering or leaving the plaintiff’s
premises numbered 141, 143, 145, 147 North Street in said
Boston, or by intimidating, by threats, express or implied, of violence
or physical harm to body or property, any person or persons who now
are or hereafter may be in the employment of the plaintiff, or desirous
of entering the same, from entering or continuing in it, or by in any
way hindering, interfering with, or preventing any person or persons
who now are in the employment of the plaintiff from continuing
therein, so long as they may be bound so to do by lawful contract.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Allen, J.</span> The principal question in this case is whether the defendants
should be enjoined against maintaining the patrol. The report
shows that, following upon a strike of the plaintiff’s workmen,
the defendants conspired to prevent him from getting workmen, and
thereby to prevent him from carrying on his business, unless and until
he should adopt a certain schedule of prices. The means adopted
were persuasion and social pressure, threats of personal injury or unlawful
harm conveyed to persons employed or seeking employment,
and a patrol of two men in front of the plaintiff’s factory, maintained
from half-past six in the morning till half-past five in the afternoon,
on one of the busiest streets of Boston. The number of men was
greater at times, and at times showed some little disposition to stop
the plaintiff’s door. The patrol proper at times went further than
simple advice, not obtruded beyond the point where the other person
was willing to listen; and it was found that the patrol would probably
be continued, if not enjoined. There was also some evidence of persuasion
to break existing contracts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The patrol was maintained as one of the means of carrying out the
defendants’ plan, and it was used in combination with social pressure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_971'>971</span>threats of personal injury or unlawful harm, and persuasion to break
existing contracts. It was thus one means of intimidation indirectly
to the plaintiff, and directly to persons actually employed, or seeking
to be employed, by the plaintiff, and of rendering such employment
unpleasant or intolerable to such persons. Such an act is an unlawful
interference with the rights both of employer and of employed.
An employer has a right to engage all persons who are willing to work
for him, at such prices as may be mutually agreed upon; and persons
employed or seeking employment have a corresponding right to enter
into or remain in the employment of any person or corporation willing
to employ them. These rights are secured by the Constitution itself.
Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Perry, 155 Mass. 117; People <em>v.</em> Gillson, 109 N. Y.
389; Braceville Coal Co. <em>v.</em> People, 147 Ill. 66, 71; Ritchie <em>v.</em> People,
155 Ill. 98; Low <em>v.</em> Rees Printing Co., 41 Neb. 127. No one can lawfully
interfere by force or intimidation to prevent employers or persons
employed or wishing to be employed from the exercise of these
rights. In Massachusetts, as in some other States, it is even made a
criminal offence for one by intimidation or force to prevent or seek to
prevent a person from entering into or continuing in the employment
of a person or corporation. Pub. Sts. c. 74, § 2. Intimidation is not
limited to threats of violence or of physical injury to person or property.
It has a broader signification, and there also may be a moral
intimidation which is illegal. Patrolling or picketing, under the circumstances
stated in the report, has elements of intimidation like
those which were found to exist in Sherry <em>v.</em> Perkins, 147 Mass. 212.
It was declared to be unlawful in Regina <em>v.</em> Druitt, 10 Cox C. C. 592;
Regina <em>v.</em> Hibbert, 13 Cox C. C. 82; and Regina <em>v.</em> Bauld, 13 Cox
C. C. 282. It was assumed to be unlawful in Trollope <em>v.</em> London
Building Trades Federation, 11 T. L. R. 228, though in that case the
pickets were withdrawn before the bringing of the bill. The patrol
was an unlawful interference both with the plaintiff and with the
workmen, within the principle of many cases, and, when instituted
for the purpose of interfering with his business, it became a private
nuisance. See Carew <em>v.</em> Rutherford, 106 Mass. 1; Walker <em>v.</em> Cronin,
107 Mass. 555; Barr <em>v.</em> Essex Trades Council, 8 Dick. 101; Murdock
<em>v.</em> Walker, 152 Penn. St. 595; Wick China Co. <em>v.</em> Brown, 164 Penn.
St. 449; Cœur d’Alene Consolidated &amp; Mining Co. <em>v.</em> Miners’ Union,
51 Fed. Rep. 260; Temperton <em>v.</em> Russell, [1893] 1 Q. B. 715; Flood
<em>v.</em> Jackson, 11 T. L. R. 276; Wright <em>v.</em> Hennessey, a case before Baron
Pollock, 52 Alb. L. J. 104; Judge <em>v.</em> Bennett, 36 W. R. 103; Lyons <em>v.</em>
Wilkins, [1896] 1 Ch. 811.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants contend that these acts were justifiable, because
they were only seeking to secure better wages for themselves by compelling
the plaintiff to accept their schedule of wages. This motive
or purpose does not justify maintaining a patrol in front of the plaintiff’s
premises, as a means of carrying out their conspiracy. A combination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_972'>972</span>among persons merely to regulate their own conduct is within
allowable competition, and is lawful, although others may be indirectly
affected thereby. But a combination to do injurious acts expressly
directed to another, by way of intimidation or constraint
either of himself or of persons employed or seeking to be employed
by him, is outside of allowable competition, and is unlawful. Various
decided cases fall within the former class, for example: Worthington
<em>v.</em> Waring, 157 Mass. 421; Snow <em>v.</em> Wheeler, 113 Mass. 179; Bowen
<em>v.</em> Matheson, 14 Allen, 499; Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Hunt, 4 Met. 111;
Heywood <em>v.</em> Tillson, 75 Maine, 225; Cote <em>v.</em> Murphy, 159 Penn. St.
420; Bohn Manuf. Co. <em>v.</em> Hollis, 54 Minn. 223; Mogul Steamship Co.
<em>v.</em> McGregor, [1892] A. C. 25; Curran <em>v.</em> Treleaven, [1891] 2 Q. B.
545, 561. The present case falls within the latter class.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor does the fact that the defendants’ acts might subject them to
an indictment prevent a court of equity from issuing an injunction.
It is true that ordinarily a court of equity will decline to issue an
injunction to restrain the commission of a crime; but a continuing
injury to property or business may be enjoined, although it may also
be punishable as a nuisance or other crime. Sherry <em>v.</em> Perkins, 147
Mass. 212; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In re</span></i> Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 593, 599; Baltimore &amp; Potomac
Railroad <em>v.</em> Fifth Baptist Church, 108 U. S. 317, 329; Cranford
<em>v.</em> Tyrell, 128 N. Y. 341, 344; Gilbert <em>v.</em> Mickle, 4 Sandf. Ch. 357;
Mobile <em>v.</em> Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad, 84 Ala. 115, 126; Arthur

Railway <em>v.</em> Pennsylvania Co., 54 Fed. Rep. 730, 744; Emperor of
Austria <em>v.</em> Day, 3 DeG., F. &amp; J. 217, 239, 240, 253; Hermann Loog <em>v.</em>
Bean, 26 Ch. D. 306, 314, 316, 317; Monson <em>v.</em> Tussaud, [1894] 1
Q. B. 671, 689, 690, 698.</p>

<p class='c007'>A question is also presented whether the court should enjoin such
interference with persons in the employment of the plaintiff who are
not bound by contract to remain with him, or with persons who are
not under any existing contract, but who are seeking or intending to
enter into his employment. A conspiracy to interfere with the plaintiff’s
business by means of threats and intimidation, and by maintaining
a patrol in front of his premises in order to prevent persons from
entering his employment, or in order to prevent persons who are in
his employment from continuing therein, is unlawful, even though
such persons are not bound by contract to enter into or to continue
in his employment; and the injunction should not be so limited as to
relate only to persons who are bound by existing contracts. Walker

Q. B. 715, 728, 731; Flood <em>v.</em> Jackson, 11 L. T. R. 276.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_973'>973</span>[The opinion of <span class='sc'>Field, C. J.</span>, is omitted. His conclusion was,
“that the decree entered by Mr. Justice Holmes should be affirmed
without modification.”]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Holmes, J.</span> In a case like the present, it seems to me that, whatever
the true result may be, it will be of advantage to sound thinking
to have the less popular view of the law stated, and therefore, although
when I have been unable to bring my brethren to share my convictions
my almost invariable practice is to defer to them in silence, I depart
from that practice in this case, notwithstanding my unwillingness to
do so in support of an already rendered judgment of my own.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first place, a word or two should be said as to the meaning
of the report. I assume that my brethren construe it as I meant it
to be construed, and that, if they were not prepared to do so, they
would give an opportunity to the defendants to have it amended in
accordance with what I state my meaning to be. There was no proof
of any threat or danger of a patrol exceeding two men, and as of
course an injunction is not granted except with reference to what
there is reason to expect in its absence, the question on that point is
whether a patrol of two men should be enjoined. Again, the defendants
are enjoined by the final decree from intimidating by threats,
express or implied, of physical harm to body or property, any person
who may be desirous of entering into the employment of the plaintiff
so far as to prevent him from entering the same. In order to test the
correctness of the refusal to go further, it must be assumed that the
defendants obey the express prohibition of the decree. If they do not,
they fall within the injunction as it now stands, and are liable to
summary punishment. The important difference between the preliminary
and the final injunction is that the former goes further, and
forbids the defendants to interfere with the plaintiff’s business “by
any scheme&#160;... organized for the purpose of&#160;... preventing any
person or persons who now are or may hereafter be&#160;... desirous of
entering the [plaintiff’s employment] from entering it.” I quote only
a part, and the part which seems to me most objectionable. This includes
refusal of social intercourse, and even organized persuasion or
argument, although free from any threat of violence, either express
or implied. And this is with reference to persons who have a legal
right to contract or not to contract with the plaintiff, as they may see
fit. Interference with existing contracts is forbidden by the final decree.
I wish to insist a little that the only point of difference which
involves a difference of principle between the final decree and the
preliminary injunction which it is proposed to restore, is what I have
mentioned, in order that it may be seen exactly what we are to discuss.
It appears to me that the judgment of the majority turns in
part on the assumption that the patrol necessarily carries with it a
threat of bodily harm. That assumption I think unwarranted, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_974'>974</span>reasons which I have given. Furthermore, it cannot be said, I think,
that two men walking together up and down a sidewalk and speaking
to those who enter a certain shop do necessarily and always thereby
convey a threat of force. I do not think it possible to discriminate
and to say that two workmen, or even two representatives of an organization
of workmen, do,—especially when they are, and are known
to be, under the injunction of this court not to do so. See Stimson,
Handbook to Labor Law, § 60, esp. pp. 290, 298, 299, 300; Regina <em>v.</em>
Shepherd, 11 Cox C. C. 325. I may add, that I think the more intelligent
workingmen believe as fully as I do that they no more can be
permitted to usurp the State’s prerogative of force than can their
opponents in their controversies. But if I am wrong, then the decree
as it stands reaches the patrol, since it applies to all threats of force.
With this I pass to the real difference between the interlocutory and
the final decree.</p>

<p class='c007'>I agree, whatever may be the law in the case of a single defendant,
Rice <em>v.</em> Albee, 164 Mass. 88, that when a plaintiff proves that several
persons have combined and conspired to injure his business, and have
done acts producing that effect, he shows temporal damage and a cause
of action, unless the facts disclose, or the defendants prove, some
ground of excuse or justification. And I take it to be settled, and
rightly settled, that doing that damage by combined persuasion is actionable,
as well as doing it by falsehood or by force. Walker <em>v.</em>
Cronin, 107 Mass. 555; Morasse <em>v.</em> Brochu, 151 Mass. 567; Tasker <em>v.</em>
Stanley, 153 Mass. 148.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, in numberless instances the law warrants the intentional
infliction of temporal damage because it regards it as justified.
It is on the question of what shall amount to a justification, and more
especially on the nature of the considerations which really determine
or ought to determine the answer to that question, that judicial reasoning
seems to me often to be inadequate. The true grounds of decision
are considerations of policy and of social advantage, and it is
vain to suppose that solutions can be attained merely by logic and the
general propositions of law which nobody disputes. Propositions as to
public policy rarely are unanimously accepted, and still more rarely,
if ever, are capable of unanswerable proof. They require a special
training to enable any one even to form an intelligent opinion about
them. In the early stages of law, at least, they generally are acted on
rather as inarticulate instincts than as definite ideas for which a
rational defence is ready.</p>

<p class='c007'>To illustrate what I have said in the last paragraph, it has been
the law for centuries that a man may set up a business in a country
town too small to support more than one, although he expects and
intends thereby to ruin some one already there, and succeeds in his
intent. In such a case he is not held to act “unlawfully and without
justifiable cause,” as was alleged in Walker <em>v.</em> Cronin and Rice <em>v.</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_975'>975</span>Albee. The reason, of course, is that the doctrine generally has been
accepted that free competition is worth more to society than it costs,
and that on this ground the infliction of the damage is privileged.
Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Hunt, 4 Met. 111, 134. Yet even this proposition
nowadays is disputed by a considerable body of persons, including
many whose intelligence is not to be denied, little as we may agree
with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have chosen this illustration partly with reference to what I have
to say next. It shows without the need of further authority that the
policy of allowing free competition justifies the intentional inflicting
of temporal damage, including the damage of interference with a
man’s business, by some means, when the damage is done not for its
own sake, but as an instrumentality in reaching the end of victory in
the battle of trade. In such a case it cannot matter whether the plaintiff
is the only rival of the defendant, and so is aimed at specifically,
or is one of a class all of whom are hit. The only debatable ground
is the nature of the means by which such damage may be inflicted.
We all agree that it cannot be done by force or threats of force. We
all agree, I presume, that it may be done by persuasion to leave a
rival’s shop and come to the defendant’s. It may be done by the
refusal or withdrawal of various pecuniary advantages which, apart
from this consequence, are within the defendant’s lawful control. It
may be done by the withdrawal, or threat to withdraw, such advantages
from third persons who have a right to deal or not to deal with
the plaintiff, as a means of inducing them not to deal with him either
as customers or servants. Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Hunt, 4 Met. 111, 132,
133; Bowen <em>v.</em> Matheson, 14 Allen, 499; Heywood <em>v.</em> Tillson, 75
Maine, 225; Mogul Steamship Co. <em>v.</em> McGregor, [1892] A. C. 25.</p>

<p class='c007'>I pause here to remark that the word “threats” often is used as if
when it appeared that threats had been made, it appeared that unlawful
conduct had begun. But it depends on what you threaten. As a
general rule, even if subject to some exceptions, what you may do in
a certain event you may threaten to do,<a id='r609'></a><a href='#f609' class='c015'><sup>[609]</sup></a> that is, give warning of your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_976'>976</span>intention to do in that event, and thus allow the other person the
chance of avoiding the consequences. So as to “compulsion,” it depends
on how you “compel.” Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Hunt, 4 Met. 111,
133. So as to “annoyance” or “intimidation.” Connor <em>v.</em> Kent, Curran
<em>v.</em> Treleaven, 17 Cox C. C. 354, 367, 368, 370. In Sherry <em>v.</em> Perkins,
147 Mass. 212, it was found as a fact that the display of banners
which was enjoined was part of a scheme to prevent workmen from
entering or remaining in the plaintiff’s employment, “by threats
and intimidation.” The context showed that the words as there
used meant threats of personal violence, and intimidation by causing
fear of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have seen the suggestion made that the conflict between employers
and employed is not competition. But I venture to assume that none
of my brethren would rely on that suggestion. If the policy on which
our law is founded is too narrowly expressed in the term free competition,
we may substitute free struggle for life. Certainly the policy
is not limited to struggles between persons of the same class competing
for the same end. It applies to all conflicts of temporal interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far, I suppose, we are agreed. But there is a notion which latterly
has been insisted on a good deal, that a combination of persons
to do what any one of them lawfully might do by himself will make
the otherwise lawful conduct unlawful. It would be rash to say that
some as yet unformulated truth may not be hidden under this proposition.
But in the general form in which it has been presented and
accepted by many courts, I think it plainly untrue, both on authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_977'>977</span>and on principle.<a id='r610'></a><a href='#f610' class='c015'><sup>[610]</sup></a> Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Hunt, 4 Met. 111; Randall <em>v.</em>
Hazelton, 12 Allen, 412, 414. There was combination of the most
flagrant and dominant kind in Bowen <em>v.</em> Matheson and in the Mogul
Steamship Company’s case, and combination was essential to the success
achieved. But it is not necessary to cite cases; it is plain from
the slightest consideration of practical affairs, or the most superficial
reading of industrial history, that free competition means combination,
and that the organization of the world, now going on so fast,
means an ever increasing might and scope of combination. It seems
to me futile to set our faces against this tendency. Whether beneficial
on the whole, as I think it, or detrimental, it is inevitable, unless
the fundamental axioms of society, and even the fundamental conditions
of life, are to be changed.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the eternal conflicts out of which life is made up is that
between the effort of every man to get the most he can for his services,
and that of society, disguised under the name of capital, to get his
services for the least possible return. Combination on the one side is
patent and powerful. Combination on the other is the necessary and
desirable counterpart, if the battle is to be carried on in a fair and
equal way. I am unable to reconcile Temperton <em>v.</em> Russell, [1893] 1
Q. B. 715, and the cases which follow it, with the Mogul Steamship
Company case. But Temperton <em>v.</em> Russell is not a binding authority
here, and therefore I do not think it necessary to discuss it.</p>

<p class='c007'>If it be true that workingmen may combine with a view, among
other things, to getting as much as they can for their labor, just as
capital may combine with a view to getting the greatest possible return,
it must be true that when combined they have the same liberty
that combined capital has to support their interests by argument,
persuasion, and the bestowal or refusal of those advantages which
they otherwise lawfully control. I can remember when many people
thought that, apart from violence or breach of contract, strikes were
wicked, as organized refusals to work. I suppose that intelligent
economists and legislators have given up that notion to-day. I feel
pretty confident that they equally will abandon the idea that an organized
refusal by workmen of social intercourse with a man who shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_978'>978</span>enter their antagonist’s employ is wrong, if it is dissociated from any
threat of violence, and is made for the sole object of prevailing if possible
in a contest with their employer about the rate of wages. The
fact, that the immediate object of the act by which the benefit to
themselves is to be gained is to injure their antagonist, does not necessarily
make it unlawful, any more than when a great house lowers the
price of certain goods for the purpose, and with the effect, of driving
a smaller antagonist from the business. Indeed, the question seems
to me to have been decided as long ago as 1842 by the good sense of
Chief Justice Shaw, in Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Hunt, 4 Met. 111. I repeat
at the end, as I said at the beginning, that this is the point of difference
in principle, and the only one, between the interlocutory and the
final decree. See Regina <em>v.</em> Shepherd, 11 Cox C. C. 325; Connor <em>v.</em>
Kent, Gibson <em>v.</em> Lawson, Curran <em>v.</em> Treleaven, 17 Cox C. C. 354.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general question of the propriety of dealing with this kind of
case by injunction I say nothing about, because I understand that the
defendants have no objection to the final decree if it goes no further,
and that both parties wish a decision upon the matters which I have
discussed.<a id='r611'></a><a href='#f611' class='c015'><sup>[611]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Bill in equity filed in the Superior Court, by the officers and
members “of the voluntary association known as Union 257, Painters
and Decorators of America of Springfield, Massachusetts, which Union
is affiliated with a national organization of the same name, with headquarters
at Lafayette in the State of Indiana,” against the officers and
members “of the voluntary association known as Union 257, Painters
and Decorators of America, which Union is affiliated with a national
organization of the same name, with headquarters at Baltimore in the
State of Maryland,” to restrain the defendants from any acts or the
use of any methods tending to prevent the members of the plaintiff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_979'>979</span>association from securing employment or continuing in their employment.
Hearing before Dewey, J., who entered the following decree:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The cause came on to be heard, and was argued by counsel; and
thereupon, on consideration thereof, it is ordered adjudged and decreed
that the defendant association, the defendants, and each and
every of them, their committees, agents, and servants, be restrained

or attempting to interfere, with the employment of members of
the plaintiffs’ said association, by representing or causing to be represented

<span class='pageno' id='Page_980'>980</span>from securing employment or continuing in employment. And that
the plaintiffs recover their costs, taxed as in an action of law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The case was reported, at the request of both parties, for the determination
of this court. The facts appear in the opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Hammond, J.</span> This case arises out of a contest for supremacy between
two labor unions of the same craft, having substantially the
same constitution and by-laws. The chief difference between them is
that the plaintiff union is affiliated with a national organization having
its headquarters in Lafayette in the State of Indiana, while the defendant
union is affiliated with a similar organization having its headquarters
in Baltimore in the State of Maryland. The plaintiff union
was composed of workmen who in 1897 withdrew from the defendant
union.</p>

<p class='c007'>There does not appear to be anything illegal in the object of either
union as expressed in its constitution and by-laws. The defendant
union is also represented by delegates in the Central Labor Union,
which is an organization composed of five delegates from each trade
union in the city of Springfield, and had in its constitution a provision
for levying a boycott upon a complaint made by any union.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case is before us upon a report after a final decree in favor of
the plaintiffs, based upon the findings stated in the report of the
master.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contest became active early in the fall of 1898. In September
of that year, the members of the defendant union declared “all
painters not affiliated with the Baltimore headquarters to be non-union
men,” and voted to “notify the bosses” of that declaration.
The manifest object of the defendants was to have all the members of
the craft subjected to the rules and discipline of their particular union,
in order that they might have better control over the whole business,
and to that end they combined and conspired to get the plaintiffs and
each of them to join the defendant association, peaceably if possible
but by threat and intimidation if necessary. Accordingly, on October
7, they voted that “if our demands are not complied with, all men
working in shops where Lafayette people are employed refuse to go to
work.” The plaintiffs resisting whatever persuasive measures, if any,
were used by the defendants, the latter proceeded to carry out their
plan in the manner fully set forth in the master’s report. Without rehearsing
the circumstances in detail it is sufficient to say here that the
general method of operations was substantially as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>A duly authorized agent of the defendants would visit a shop where
one or more of the plaintiffs were at work and inform the employer of
the action of the defendant union with reference to the plaintiffs, and
ask him to induce such of the plaintiffs as were in his employ to sign
application for reinstatement in the defendant union. As to the
general nature of these interviews the master finds that the defendants
have been courteous in manner, have made no threats of personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_981'>981</span>violence, have referred to the plaintiffs as non-union men, but have
not otherwise represented them as men lacking good standing in their
craft; that they have not asked that the Lafayette men be discharged,
and in some cases have expressly stated that they did not wish to
have them discharged, but only that they sign the blanks for reinstatement
in the defendant union. The master, however, further finds,
from all the circumstances under which those requests were made, that
the defendants intended that employers of Lafayette men should fear
trouble in their business if they continued to employ such men, and
that employers to whom these requests were made were justified in
believing that a failure on the part of their employees who were
Lafayette men to sign such reinstatement blanks, and a failure on the
part of the employers to discharge them for not doing so, would lead
to trouble in the business of the employers in the nature of strikes or
a boycott, and the employers to whom these requests were made did
believe that such results would follow, and did suggest their belief to
the defendants, and the defendants did not deny that such results
might occur; that the strikes which did occur appear to have been
steps taken by the defendants to obtain the discharge of such employees
as were Lafayette men who declined to sign application blanks
for reinstatement; that these defendants did not in all cases threaten
a boycott of the employers’ business, but did threaten that the place
of business of at least one such employer would be left off from a so-called
“fair list” to be published by the Baltimore Union. The master
also found that, from all the evidence presented, the object which
the Baltimore men and the defendant association sought to accomplish
in all the acts which were testified to was to compel the members of
the Lafayette Union to join the Baltimore Union, and as a means to
this end they caused strikes to be instituted in the shops where strikes
would seriously interfere with the business of the shops, and in all
other shops they made such representations as would lead the proprietors
thereof to expect trouble in their business.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have, therefore, a case where the defendants have conspired to
compel the members of the plaintiff union to join the defendant union,
and to carry out their purpose have resolved upon such coercion and
intimidation as naturally may be caused by threats of loss of property
by strikes and boycotts, to induce the employers either to get the
plaintiffs to ask for reinstatement in the defendant union, or, that
failing, then to discharge them. It matters not that this request to
discharge has not been expressly made. There can be no doubt, upon
the findings of the master and the facts stated in his report, that the
compulsory discharge of the plaintiffs in case of non-compliance with
the demands of the defendant union is one of the prominent features
of the plan agreed upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well to see what is the meaning of this threat to strike, when
taken in connection with the intimation that the employer may “expect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_982'>982</span>trouble in his business.” It means more than that the strikers
will cease to work. That is only the preliminary skirmish. It means
that those who have ceased to work will, by strong, persistent, and
organized persuasion and social pressure of every description, do all
they can to prevent the employer from procuring workmen to take
their places. It means much more. It means that, if these peaceful
measures fail, the employer may reasonably expect that unlawful
physical injury may be done to his property; that attempts in all the
ways practised by organized labor will be made to injure him in his
business, even to his ruin, if possible; and that, by the use of vile and
opprobrious epithets and other annoying conduct, and actual and
threatened personal violence, attempts will be made to intimidate
those who enter or desire to enter his employ; and that whether or not
all this be done by the strikers or only by their sympathizers, or with
the open sanction and approval of the former, he will have no help
from them in his efforts to protect himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>However mild the language or suave the manner in which the threat
to strike is made under such circumstances as are disclosed in this
case, the employer knows that he is in danger of passing through
such an ordeal as that above described, and those who make the threat
know that as well as he does. Even if the intent of the strikers, so far
as respects their own conduct and influence, be to discountenance all
actual or threatened injury to person or property or business, except
that which is the direct necessary result of the interruption of the
work, and even if their connection with the injurious and violent conduct
of the turbulent among them or of their sympathizers be not
such as to make them liable criminally or even answerable civilly in
damages to those who suffer, still with full knowledge of what is to
be expected they give the signal, and in so doing must be held to avail
themselves of the degree of fear and dread which the knowledge of
such consequences will cause in the mind of those—whether their
employer or fellow workmen—against whom the strike is directed;
and the measure of coercion and intimidation imposed upon those
against whom the strike is threatened or directed is not fully realized
until all those probable consequences are considered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such is the nature of the threat, and such the degree of coercion
and intimidation involved in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the defendants can lawfully perform the acts complained of in
the city of Springfield, they can pursue the plaintiffs all over the
State in the same manner, and compel them to abandon their trade
or bow to the behests of their pursuers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be observed that this is not a case between the employer and
employed, or, to use a hackneyed expression, between capital and
labor, but between laborers all of the same craft, and each having the
same right as any one of the others to pursue his calling. In this, as in
every other case of equal rights, the right of each individual is to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_983'>983</span>exercised with due regard to the similar right of all others, and the
right of one be said to end where that of another begins.</p>

<p class='c007'>The right involved is the right to dispose of one’s labor with full
freedom. This is a legal right, and it is entitled to legal protection.
Sir William Erle in his book on Trade Unions, page 12, has stated
this in the following language, which has been several times quoted
with approval by judges in England: “Every person has a right under
the law, as between him and his fellow subjects, to full freedom in
disposing of his own labor or his own capital according to his own
will. It follows that every other person is subject to the correlative
duty arising therefrom, and is prohibited from any obstruction to the
fullest exercise of this right which can be made compatible with the
exercise of similar rights by others. Every act causing an obstruction
to another in the exercise of the right comprised within this description—done,
not in the exercise of the actor’s own right, but for the
purpose of obstruction—would if damage should be caused thereby
to the party obstructed, be a violation of this prohibition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The same rule is stated with care and discrimination by Wells, J.,
in Walker <em>v.</em> Cronin, 107 Mass. 555, 564: “Every one has a right to
enjoy the fruits and advantages of his own enterprise, industry, skill,
and credit. He has no right to be protected against competition; but
he has a right to be free from malicious and wanton interference,
disturbance, or annoyance. If disturbance or loss come as a result
of competition, or the exercise of like rights by others, it is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum
absque injuria</span></i>, unless some superior right by contract or otherwise is
interfered with. But if it come from the merely wanton or malicious
acts of others, without the justification of competition or the service
of any interest or lawful purpose, it then stands upon a different
footing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In this case the acts complained of were calculated to cause damage
to the plaintiffs, and did actually cause such damage; and they were
intentionally done for that purpose. Unless, therefore, there was
justifiable cause, the acts were malicious and unlawful. Walker <em>v.</em>
Cronin, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra</span></i>, Carew <em>v.</em> Rutherford, 106 Mass. 1, and cases cited
therein.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants contend that they have done nothing unlawful, and,
in support of that contention, they say that a person may work for
whom he pleases; and, in the absence of any contract to the contrary,
may cease to work when he pleases, and for any reason whatever,
whether the same be good or bad; that he may give notice of his intention
in advance, with or without stating the reason; that what one
man may do several men acting in concert may do, and may agree
beforehand that they will do, and may give notice of the agreement;
and that all this may be lawfully done notwithstanding such concerted
action may, by reason of the consequent interruption of the work, result
in great loss to the employer and his other employees, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_984'>984</span>such a result was intended. In a general sense, and without reference
to exceptions arising out of conflicting public and private interests,
all this may be true.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said also that, where one has the lawful right to do a thing,
the motive by which he is actuated is immaterial. One form of this
statement appears in the first head-note in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, as reported
in [1898] A. C. 1, as follows: “An act lawful in itself is not converted
by a malicious or bad motive into an unlawful act so as to
make the doer of the act liable to a civil action.” If the meaning of
this and similar expressions is that where a person has the lawful
right to do a thing irrespective of his motive, his motive is immaterial
the proposition is a mere truism. If, however, the meaning is that
where a person, if actuated by one kind of a motive, has a lawful right
to do a thing, the act is lawful when done under any conceivable motive;
or that an act lawful under one set of circumstances is therefore
lawful under every conceivable set of circumstances, the proposition
does not commend itself to us as either logically or legally accurate.</p>

<p class='c007'>In so far as a right is lawful, it is lawful, and in many cases the
right is so far absolute as to be lawful whatever may be the motive of
the actor, as where one digs upon his own land for water (Greenleaf
<em>v.</em> Francis, 18 Pick. 117), or makes a written lease of his land for the
purpose of terminating a tenancy at will (Groustra <em>v.</em> Bourges, 141
Mass. 7), but in many cases the lawfulness of an act which causes
damage to another may depend upon whether the act is for justifiable
cause; and this justification may be found sometimes in the circumstances
under which it is done irrespective of motive, sometimes in
the motive alone, and sometimes in the circumstances and motive
combined.</p>

<p class='c007'>This principle is of very general application in criminal law, and
also is illustrated in many branches of the civil law, as in cases of
libel and of procuring a wife to leave her husband. Tasker <em>v.</em> Stanley,
153 Mass. 148, and cases therein cited. Indeed the principle is a
prominent feature underlying the whole doctrine of privilege, malice,
and intent. See on this an instructive article in 8 Harvard Law
Review, 1, where the subject is considered at some length.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is manifest that not much progress is made by such general
statements as those quoted above from Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, whatever may
be their meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still standing for solution is the question, Under what circumstances,
including the motive of the actor, is the act complained of
lawful, and to what extent?</p>

<p class='c007'>In cases somewhat akin to the one at bar this court has had occasion
to consider the question how far acts, manifestly coercive and
intimidating in their nature, which cause damage and injury to the
business or property of another, and are done with intent to cause
such injury and partly in reliance upon such coercion, are justifiable.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_985'>985</span>In Bowen <em>v.</em> Matheson, 14 Allen, 499, it was held to be lawful for
persons engaged in the business of shipping seamen to combine together
into a society for the purpose of competing with other persons
engaged in the same business, and it was held lawful for them, in
pursuance of that purpose, to take men out of a ship, if men shipped
by a non-member were in that ship; to refuse to furnish seamen
through a non-member; to notify the public that they had combined
against non-members, and had “laid the plaintiff on the shelf”; to
notify the plaintiff’s customers and friends that the plaintiff could
not ship seamen for them; and to interfere in all these ways with
the business of the plaintiff as a shipping agent, and compel him to
abandon the same. The justification for these acts, so injurious to
the business of the plaintiff and so intimidating in their nature, is
to be found in the law of competition. No legal right of the plaintiff
was infringed upon, and, as stated by Chapman, J., in giving the
opinion of the court (p. 503), “if their effect is to destroy the business
of shipping-masters who are not members of the association, it is such
a result as in the competition of business often follows from a course
of proceeding that the law permits.” The primary object of the defendants
was to build up their own business, and this they might
lawfully do to the extent disclosed in that case, even to the injury of
their rivals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Similar decisions have been made in other courts where acts somewhat
coercive in their nature and effect have been held justifiable
under the law of competition. Mogul Steamship Co. <em>v.</em> McGregor,
[1892] A. C. 25; Bohn Manuf. Co. <em>v.</em> Hollis, 54 Minn. 223; Macauley
<em>v.</em> Tierney, 19 R. I. 255.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, it was held in Carew <em>v.</em> Rutherford, 106 Mass. 1,
that a conspiracy against a mechanic,—who is under the necessity of
employing workmen in order to carry on his business,—to obtain a
sum of money from him which he is under no legal obligation to pay,
by inducing his workmen to leave him or by deterring others from
entering into his employ, or by threatening to do this so that he is
induced to pay the money demanded, under a reasonable apprehension
that he cannot carry on his business without yielding to the demands,
is an illegal, if not a criminal conspiracy; that the acts done under it
are illegal, and that the money thus obtained may be recovered back.
Chapman, C. J., speaking for the court, says that there is no doubt
that, if the parties under such circumstances succeed in injuring the
business of the mechanic, they are liable to pay all the damages done
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>That case bears a close analogy to the one at bar. The acts there
threatened were like those in this case, and the purpose was, in substance,
to force the plaintiff to give his work to the defendants, and
to extort from him a fine because he had given some of his work to
other persons.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_986'>986</span>Without now indicating to what extent workmen may combine and
in pursuance of an agreement may act by means of strikes and boycotts
to get the hours of labor reduced or their wages increased, or to
procure from their employers any other concession directly and immediately
affecting their own interests, or to help themselves in competition
with their fellow-workmen, we think this case must be governed
by the principles laid down in Carew <em>v.</em> Rutherford, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra</span></i>.
The purpose of these defendants was to force the plaintiffs to join the
defendant association, and to that end they injured the plaintiffs in
their business, and molested and disturbed them in their efforts to
work at their trade. It is true they committed no acts of personal
violence, or of physical injury to property, although they threatened
to do something which might reasonably be expected to lead to such
results. In their threat, however, there was plainly that which was
coercive in its effect upon the will. It is not necessary that the liberty
of the body should be restrained. Restraint of the mind, provided
it would be such as would be likely to force a man against his
will to grant the thing demanded, and actually has that effect, is sufficient
in cases like this. As stated by Lord Bramwell in Regina <em>v.</em>
Druitt, 10 Cox C. C. 592, 600, “No right of property, or capital,&#160;...
was so sacred, or so carefully guarded by the law of this land, as that
of personal liberty.... That liberty was not liberty of the body only.
It was also a liberty of the mind and will; and the liberty of a man’s
mind and will, to say how he should bestow himself and his means,
his talents, and his industry, was as much a subject of the law’s protection
as was that of his body.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not the intention of the defendants to give fairly to the employer
the option to employ them or the plaintiffs, but to compel the
latter against their will to join the association, and to that end to molest
and interfere with them in their efforts to procure work by acts
and threats well calculated by their coercive and intimidating nature
to overcome the will.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants might make such lawful rules as they please for
the regulation of their own conduct, but they had no right to force
other persons to join them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The necessity that the plaintiffs should join this association is not
so great, nor is its relation to the rights of the defendants, as compared
with the right of the plaintiffs to be free from molestation, such
as to bring the acts of the defendants under the shelter of the principles
of trade competition. Such acts are without justification, and
therefore are malicious and unlawful, and the conspiracy thus to force
the plaintiffs was unlawful. Such conduct is intolerable, and inconsistent
with the spirit of our laws.</p>

<p class='c007'>The language used by this court in Carew <em>v.</em> Rutherford, 106 Mass.
1, 15, may be repeated here with emphasis, as applicable to this case:
“The acts alleged and proved in this case are peculiarly offensive to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_987'>987</span>the free principles which prevail in this country; and if such practices
could enjoy impunity, they would tend to establish a tyranny of
irresponsible persons over labor and mechanical business which would
be extremely injurious to both.” See, in addition to the authorities
above cited, Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Hunt, 4 Met. 111; Sherry <em>v.</em> Perkins,
147 Mass. 212, 214; Vegelahn <em>v.</em> Guntner, 167 Mass. 92, 97; St. 1894,
c. 508, § 2;<a id='r612'></a><a href='#f612' class='c015'><sup>[612]</sup></a> State <em>v.</em> Donaldson, 3 Vroom, 151; State <em>v.</em> Stewart, 59
Vt. 273; State <em>v.</em> Glidden, 55 Conn. 46; State <em>v.</em> Dyer, 67 Vt. 690;
Lucke <em>v.</em> Clothing Cutters &amp; Trimmers’ Assembly, 77 Md. 396.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the plaintiffs have been injured by these acts, and there is reason
to believe that the defendants contemplate further proceedings of the
same kind which will be likely still more to injure the plaintiffs, a bill
in equity lies to enjoin the defendants. Vegelahn <em>v.</em> Guntner, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi
supra</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some phases of the labor question have recently been discussed in
the very elaborately considered case of Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra</span></i>.
Whether or not the decision made therein is inconsistent with the
propositions upon which we base our decision in this case, we are not
disposed, in view of the circumstances under which that decision was
made, to follow it. We prefer the view expressed by the dissenting
judges, which view, it may be remarked, was entertained not only by
three of the nine lords who sat in the case, but also by the great majority
of the common law judges who had occasion officially to express
an opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>There must be, therefore, a decree for the plaintiffs. We think, however,
that the clause, “or by causing or attempting to cause, any
person to discriminate against any employer of members of plaintiffs’
said association (because he is such employer) in giving or allowing
the performance of contracts to or by such employer,” is too broad
and indefinite, inasmuch as it might seem to include mere lawful persuasion
and other similar and peaceful acts; and for that reason, and
also because so far as respects unlawful acts it seems to cover only
such acts as are prohibited by other parts of the decree, we think it
should be omitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inasmuch as the association of the defendants is not a corporation,
an injunction cannot be issued against it as such, but only against its
members, their agents and servants.</p>

<p class='c007'>As thus modified, in the opinion of the majority of the court, the
decree should stand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Holmes, C. J.</span> When a question has been decided by the court, I
think it proper, as a general rule, that a dissenting judge, however
strong his convictions may be, should thereafter accept the law from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_988'>988</span>the majority and leave the remedy to the Legislature, if that body
sees fit to interfere. If the decision in the present case simply had
relied upon Vegelahn <em>v.</em> Guntner, 167 Mass. 92, I should have hesitated
to say anything, although I might have stated that my personal
opinion had not been weakened by the substantial agreement with my
views to be found in the judgments of the majority of the House of
Lords in Allen <em>v.</em> Flood, [1898] A. C. 1. But much to my satisfaction,
if I may say so, the court has seen fit to adopt the mode of approaching
the question which I believe to be the correct one, and to open an
issue which otherwise I might have thought closed. The difference
between my brethren and me now seems to be a difference of degree,
and the line of reasoning followed makes it proper for me to explain
where the difference lies.</p>

<p class='c007'>I agree that the conduct of the defendants is actionable unless justified.
May <em>v.</em> Wood, 172 Mass. 11, 14, and cases cited. I agree that
the presence or absence of justification may depend upon the object
of their conduct, that is, upon the motive with which they acted.
Vegelahn <em>v.</em> Guntner, 167 Mass. 92, 105, 106. I agree, for instance,
that if a boycott or a strike is intended to override the jurisdiction of
the courts by the action of a private association, it may be illegal.
Weston <em>v.</em> Barnicoat, 175 Mass. 454. On the other hand, I infer that
a majority of my brethren would admit that a boycott or strike intended
to raise wages directly might be lawful, if it did not embrace
in its scheme or intent violence, breach of contract, or other conduct
unlawful on grounds independent of the mere fact that the action of
the defendants was combined. A sensible workingman would not contend
that the courts should sanction a combination for the purpose
of inflicting or threatening violence or the infraction of admitted
rights. To come directly to the point, the issue is narrowed to the
question whether, assuming that some purposes would be a justification,
the purpose in this case of the threatened boycotts and strikes
was such as to justify the threats. That purpose was not directly
concerned with wages. It was one degree more remote. The immediate
object and motive was to strengthen the defendants’ society as a
preliminary and means to enable it to make a better fight on questions
of wages or other matters of clashing interests. I differ from
my brethren in thinking that the threats were as lawful for this preliminary
purpose as for the final one to which strengthening the union
was a means. I think that unity of organization is necessary to make
the contest of labor effectual, and that societies of laborers lawfully
may employ in their preparation the means which they might use in
the final contest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although this is not the place for extended economic discussion,
and although the law may not always reach ultimate economic conceptions,
I think it well to add that I cherish no illusions as to the meaning
and effect of strikes. While I think the strike a lawful instrument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_989'>989</span>in the universal struggle of life, I think it pure phantasy to suppose
that there is a body of capital of which labor as a whole secures a
larger share by that means. The annual product, subject to an infinitesimal
deduction for the luxuries of the few, is directed to consumption
by the multitude, and is consumed by the multitude always.
Organization and strikes may get a larger share for the members of an
organization, but, if they do, they get it at the expense of the less organized
and less powerful portion of the laboring mass. They do not
create something out of nothing. It is only by divesting our minds of
questions of ownership and other machinery of distribution, and by
looking solely at the question of consumption,—asking ourselves
what is the annual product, who consumes it, and what changes would
or could we make,—that we can keep in the world of realities. But,
subject to the qualifications which I have expressed, I think it lawful
for a body of workmen to try by combination to get more than they
now are getting, although they do it at the expense of their fellows,
and to that end to strengthen their union by the boycott and the
strike.<a id='r613'></a><a href='#f613' class='c015'><sup>[613]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c013'>MARTELL <em>v.</em> WHITE<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, March 1, 1904.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 185 Massachusetts Reports, 255.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Tort for alleged conspiracy to injure plaintiffs business. In the
Superior Court, Bishop, J., ordered a verdict for defendants, and
plaintiff excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Hammond, J.</span> The evidence warranted the finding of the following
facts, many of which were not in dispute. The plaintiff was engaged
in a profitable business in quarrying granite and selling the
same to granite workers in Quincy and vicinity. About January,
1899, his customers left him, and his business was ruined through the
action of the defendants and their associates.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants were all members of a voluntary association known
as the Granite Manufacturers’ Association of Quincy, Mass., and some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_990'>990</span>of them were on the executive committee. The association was composed
of “such individuals, firms, or corporations as are, or are about
to become manufacturers, quarriers, or polishers of granite.” There
was no constitution, and, while there were by-laws, still, except as
hereinafter stated, there was in them no statement of the objects for
which the association was formed. The by-laws provided among other
things for the admission, suspension and expulsion of members, the
election of officers, including an executive committee, and defined the
respective powers and duties of the officers. One of the by-laws read
as follows: “For the purpose of defraying in part the expense of the
maintenance of this organization, any member thereof having business
transactions with any party or concern in Quincy or its vicinity,
not members hereof, and in any way relating to the cutting, quarrying,
polishing, buying or selling of granite (hand polishers excepted), shall
for each of said transactions contribute at least $1 and not more than
$500. The amount to be fixed by the association upon its determining
the amount and nature of said transaction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Acting under the by-laws, the association investigated charges
which were made against several of its members that they had purchased
granite from a party “not a member” of the association. The
charges were proved, and under the section above quoted it was voted
that the offending parties “should respectively contribute to the funds
of the association” the sums named in the votes. These sums ranged
from $10 to $100. Only the contribution of $100 has been paid, but it
is a fair inference that the proceedings to collect the others have been
delayed only by reason of this suit. The party “not a member” was
the present plaintiff, and the members of the association knew it.
Most of the customers of the plaintiff were members of the association,
and after these proceedings they declined to deal with him. This action
on their part was due to the course of the association in compelling
them to contribute as above stated, and to their fear that a
similar vote for contribution would be passed should they continue to
trade with the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury might properly have found also that the euphemistic expression
“shall contribute to the funds of the association” contained
an idea which could be more tersely and accurately expressed by the
phrase “shall pay a fine,” or, in other words, that the plain intent of
the section was to provide for the imposition upon those who came
within its provisions of a penalty in the nature of a substantial fine.
The bill of exceptions recites that “there was no evidence of threats
or intimidation practiced upon the plaintiff himself, and the acts
complained of were confined to the action of the society upon its own
members.” We understand this statement to mean simply that the
acts of the association concerned only such of the plaintiff’s customers
as were members, and that no pressure was brought to bear
upon the plaintiff except such as fairly resulted from action upon his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_991'>991</span>customers. While it is true that the by-law was not directed expressly
against the plaintiff by name, still he belonged to the class whose business
it was intended to affect, and the proceedings actually taken were
based upon transactions with him alone, and in that way were directed
against his business alone. It was the intention of the defendants to
withdraw his customers from him, if possible, by the imposition of
fines upon them, with the knowledge that the result would be a great
loss to the plaintiff. The defendants must be presumed to have intended
the natural result of their acts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here, then, is a clear and deliberate interference with the business
of a person with the intention of causing damage to him and ending
in that result. The defendants combined and conspired together to
ruin the plaintiff in his business, and they accomplished their purpose.
In all this have they kept within lawful bounds? It is elemental that
the unlawfulness of a conspiracy may be found either in the end
sought or the means to be used. If either is unlawful within the meaning
of the term as applied to the subject, then the conspiracy is unlawful.
It becomes necessary, therefore, to examine into the nature of the
conspiracy in this case, both as to the object sought and the means
used.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case presents one phase of a general subject which gravely concerns
the interests of the business world and indeed those of all organized
society, and which in recent years has demanded and received
great consideration in the courts and elsewhere. Much remains to be
done to clear the atmosphere, but some things at least appear to have
been settled, and certainly at this stage of the judicial inquiry it cannot
be necessary to enter upon a course of reasoning or to cite authorities
in support of the proposition that while a person must submit to
competition he has the right to be protected from malicious interference
with his business. The rule is well stated in Walker <em>v.</em> Cronin,
107 Mass. 555, 564, in the following language: “Every one has a right
to enjoy the fruits and advantages of his own enterprise, industry,
skill and credit. He has no right to be protected against competition;
but he has a right to be free from malicious and wanton interference,
disturbance or annoyance. If disturbance or loss come as a result of
competition, or the exercise of like rights by others, it is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum
absque injuria</span></i>, unless some superior right by contract or otherwise is
interfered with. But if it come from the merely wanton or malicious
acts of others, without the justification of competition or the service
of any interest or lawful purpose, it then stands upon a different
footing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a case like this, where the injury is intentionally inflicted, the
crucial question is whether there is justifiable cause for the act. If
the injury be inflicted without just cause or excuse, then it is actionable.
Bowen, L. J., in Mogul Steamship Co. <em>v.</em> McGregor, 23 Q. B.
D. 598, 613; Plant <em>v.</em> Woods, 176 Mass. 492. The justification must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_992'>992</span>be as broad as the act and must cover not only the motive and the
purpose, or in other words the object sought, but also the means used.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants contend that both as to object and means they are
justified by the law applicable to business competition. In considering
this defence it is to be remembered, as was said by Bowen, L. J.,
in Mogul Steamship Co. <em>v.</em> McGregor, L. R. 23 Q. B. D. 598, 611, that
there is presented “an apparent conflict or antimony between two
rights that are equally regarded by the law—the right of the plaintiff
to be protected in the legitimate exercise of his trade and the right
of the defendants to carry on their business as seems best to them,
provided they commit no wrong to others.” Here, as in most cases
where there is a conflict between two important principles, either of
which is sound and to be sustained within proper bounds, but each
of which must finally yield to some extent to the other, it frequently
is not possible by a general formula to mark out the dividing line
with reference to every conceivable case, and it is not wise to attempt
it. The best and only practicable course is to consider the cases as
they arise, and, bearing in mind the grounds upon which the soundness
of each principle is supposed to rest, by a process of elimination
and comparison to establish points through which at least the line
must run and beyond which the party charged with trespass shall not
be allowed to go.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the purpose to injure the plaintiff appears clearly enough, the
object or motive is left somewhat obscure upon the evidence. The
association had no written constitution, and the by-laws do not expressly
set forth its objects. It is true that from the by-laws it appears
that none but persons engaged in the granite business can be members,
and that a member transacting any business of this kind with a person
not a member is liable to a fine; from which it may be inferred that
it is the idea of the members that for the protection of their business
it would be well to confine it to transactions among themselves, and
that one at least of the objects of the association is to advance the interests
of the members in that way. The oral testimony tends to show
that one object of the association is to see that agreements made between
its members and their employees and between this association
and similar associations in the same line of business be kept and “lived
up to.” Whether this failure to set out fully in writing the objects is
due to any reluctance to have them clearly appear or to some other
cause, is of course not material to this case. The result, however, is
that its objects do not so clearly appear as might be desired; but in
view of the conclusion to which we have come as to the means used,
it is not necessary to inquire more closely as to the objects. It may be
assumed that one of the objects was to enable the members to compete
more successfully with others in the same business, and that the acts
of which the plaintiff complains were done for the ultimate protection
and advancement of their own business interests, with no intention or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_993'>993</span>desire to injure the plaintiff except so far as such injury was the necessary
result of measures taken for their own interests. If that was true,
then so far as respects the end sought the conspiracy does not seem to
have been illegal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next question is whether there is anything unlawful or wrongful
in the means used as applied to the acts in question. Nothing
need be said in support of the general right to compete. To what
extent combination may be allowed in competition is a matter about
which there is as yet much conflict, but it is possible that in a more
advanced stage of the discussion the day may come when it will be
more clearly seen and will more distinctly appear in the adjudication
of the courts than as yet has been the case; that the proposition that
what one man lawfully can do any number of men acting together by
combined agreement lawfully may do, is to be received with newly
disclosed qualifications arising out of the changed conditions of civilized
life and of the increased facility and power of organized combination,
and that the difference between the power of individuals
acting each according to his own preference and that of an organized
and extensive combination may be so great in its effect upon public
and private interests as to cease to be simply one of degree and to
reach the dignity of a difference in kind. Indeed, in the language of
Bowen, L. J., in the Mogul Steamship case, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra</span></i>, page 616: “Of
the general proposition that certain kinds of conduct not criminal in
one individual may become criminal if done by combination among
several, there can be no doubt. The distinction is based on sound
reason, for a combination may make oppressive or dangerous that
which if it proceeded only from a single person would be otherwise,
and the very fact of the combination may show that the object is
simply to do harm, and not to exercise one’s own just rights.” See also
opinion of Stirling, L. J., in Giblan <em>v.</em>  National Amalgamated Laborers’
Union, [1903] 2 K. B. 600, 621. Speaking generally, however,
competition in business is permitted, although frequently disastrous
to those engaged in it. It is always selfish, often sharp, and sometimes
deadly. Conspicuous illustrations of the destructive extent to which
it may be carried are to be found in the Mogul Steamship case above
cited, and in Bowen <em>v.</em>  Matheson, 14 Allen, 499. The fact therefore
that the plaintiff was vanquished is not enough, provided that the contest
was carried on within the rules allowable in such warfare.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a right, however, which is to be exercised with reference to
the existence of a similar right on the part of others. The trader has
not a free lance. He may fight, but as a soldier, not as a guerilla. The
right of competition rests upon the doctrine that the interests of the
great public are best subserved by permitting the general and natural
laws of business to have their full and free operation, and that this
end is best attained when the trader is allowed in his business to make
free use of these laws. He may praise his wares, may offer more advantageous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_994'>994</span>terms than his rival, may sell at less than cost, or, in the
words of Bowen, L. J., in the Mogul Steamship case, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra</span></i>, may
adopt “the expedient of sowing one year a crop of apparently unfruitful
prices in order by driving competition away to realize a fuller
harvest of profit in the future.” In these and many other obvious
ways he may secure the customers of his rival, and build up his
own business to the destruction of that of others, and so long as he
keeps within the operation of the laws of trade his justification is
complete.</p>

<p class='c007'>But from the very nature of the case it is manifest that the right
of competition furnishes no justification for an act done by the use of
means which in their nature are in violation of the principle upon
which it rests. The weapons used by the trader who relies upon this
right for justification must be those furnished by the laws of trade,
or at least must not be inconsistent with their free operation. No
man can justify an interference with another man’s business through
fraud or misrepresentation, nor by intimidation, obstruction or molestation.
In the case before us the members of the association were to
be held to the policy of refusing to trade with the plaintiff by the imposition
of heavy fines, or in other words they were coerced by actual
or threatened injury to their property. It is true that one may leave
the association if he desires, but if he stays in it he is subjected to the
coercive effect of a fine to be determined and enforced by the majority.
This method of procedure is arbitrary and artificial, and is based in
no respect upon the grounds upon which competition in business is
permitted, but on the contrary it creates a motive for business action
inconsistent with that freedom of choice out of which springs the benefit
of competition to the public, and has no natural or logical relation
to the grounds upon which the right to compete is based. Such a
method of influencing a person may be coercive and illegal. Carew <em>v.</em>
Rutherford, 106 Mass. 1.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor is the nature of the coercion changed by the fact that the persons
fined were members of the association. The words of Munson,
J., in Boutwell <em>v.</em>  Marr, 71 Vt. 1, 9, are applicable here: “The law
cannot be compelled by any initial agreement of an associate member
to treat him as one having no choice but that of the majority, nor as
a willing participant in whatever action may be taken. The voluntary
acceptance of by-laws providing for the imposition of coercive
fines does not make them legal and collectible, and the standing threat
of their imposition may properly be classed with the ordinary threats
of suits upon groundless claims. The fact that the relations and processes
deemed essential to a recovery are brought within the membership
and proceedings of an organized body cannot change the result.
The law sees in the membership of an association of this character both
the authors of its coercive system and the victim of its unlawful pressure.
If this were not so, men could deprive their fellows of established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_995'>995</span>rights, and evade the duty of compensation, simply by working
through an association.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In view of the considerations upon which the right of competition
is based, we are of opinion that as against the plaintiff the defendants
have failed to show that the coercion or intimidation of the plaintiff’s
customers by means of a fine is justified by the law of competition.
The ground of the justification is not broad enough to cover the acts
of interference in their entirety, and the interference being injurious
and unjustifiable is unlawful.</p>

<p class='c007'>We do not mean to be understood as saying that a fine is of itself
necessarily or even generally an illegal implement. In many cases
it is so slight as not to be coercive in its nature; in many it serves a
useful purpose to call the attention of a member of an organization to
the fact of the infraction of some innocent regulation; and in many
it serves as an extra incentive to the performance of some absolute
duty or the assertion of some absolute right. But where, as in the
case before us, the fine is so large as to amount to moral intimidation
or coercion, and is used as a means to enforce a right not absolute in
its nature but conditional, and is inconsistent with those conditions
upon which the right rests, then the coercion becomes unjustifiable
and taints with illegality the act.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants strongly rely upon Bowen <em>v.</em>  Matheson, 14 Allen,
499; Mogul Steamship Co. <em>v.</em>  McGregor, [1892] A. C. 25; Bohn
Mfg. Co. <em>v.</em>  Hollis, 54 Minn. 223; Macauley Bros. <em>v.</em>  Tierney, 19 R. I.
255, and Cote <em>v.</em>  Murphy, 159 Penn. St. 420. In none of these cases
was there any coercion by means of fines upon those who traded with
the plaintiff. Inducements were held out, but they were such as are
naturally incident to competition, for instance, more advantageous
terms in the way of discounts, increased trade, and otherwise. In the
Minnesota case there was among the rules of the association a clause
requiring the plaintiff to pay 10 per cent, but the propriety or the
legality of that provision was not involved. In Bowen <em>v.</em>  Matheson,
it is true that the by-laws provided for a fine, but the declaration did
not charge that any coercion by means of a fine had been used. A
demurrer to the declaration was sustained upon the ground that there
was no sufficient allegation of an illegal act. The only allegation
which need be noticed here was that the defendants “did prevent men
from shipping with” the plaintiff, and as to this the court said: “This
might be done in many ways which are legal and proper, and as no
illegal methods are stated the allegation is bad.” This comes far short
of sustaining the defendants in their course of coercion by means of
fines. As to the other cases cited by the defendant it may be said
that, while bearing upon the general subject of which the present case
presents one phase, they are not inconsistent with the conclusion to
which we have come. Among the authorities bearing upon the general
subject and having some relation to the questions involved in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_996'>996</span>case, see, in addition to those hereinbefore cited, Slaughter-House

<h4 class='c013'>PICKETT <em>v.</em>  WALSH<br /> <span class='sc'>Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, October 16, 1906.</span><br /> <em>Reported in 192 Massachusetts Reports, 572.</em></h4>

<p class='c022'>The plaintiffs were brick and stone “pointers.” The defendants were
officers and members of bricklayers’ unions and stonemasons’ unions.<a id='r615'></a><a href='#f615' class='c015'><sup>[615]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>One ground of complaint was that the defendants prevented the employment
of the plaintiffs as “pointers” by notifying contractors that they would
not lay the bricks or do the mason work on any building unless they were also
employed to do the pointing of the brick and stone masonry. “The defendants
in effect say we want the work of pointing the brick and stone laid by us,
and you must give us all or none of the work.”<a id='r616'></a><a href='#f616' class='c015'><sup>[616]</sup></a> The court held that this conduct,
although disastrous to the plaintiffs and damaging to the building contractors,
was justifiable. “... it was within the rights of these unions to
compete for the work of doing the pointing, and, in the exercise of their right
of competition, to refuse to lay bricks and set stone unless they were given the
work of pointing them when laid.”<a id='r617'></a><a href='#f617' class='c015'><sup>[617]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>The other ground of action in Pickett <em>v.</em>  Walsh was quite distinct from the
foregoing. The firm of L. P. Soule &amp; Son Company were the general contractors
for the erection of the Ford building; but they had nothing to do with the
employment of “pointers.” The pointing of that building was being done
under a contract between the owners of the building and Pickett, a pointer
who was one of the plaintiffs. Other buildings were being erected for other
owners, on which the Soule Company were the general contractors, and as to
which no complaint existed in reference to the pointing. The bricklaying and
masonry on these other buildings were being done by members of the defendants’
union. The defendant officials induced all the bricklayers and masons
to quit working for the Soule Company on these other buildings, because that
company “was doing work on another building [the Ford building] in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_997'>997</span>work was being done by pointers, employed not by the L. P. Soule &amp; Son Company
but [by] the owners of the building.” The evident purpose was to thus
induce the Soule Company to exert pressure on the owners of the Ford building
to discontinue the employment of the pointers (Pickett <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et als.</span></i>). The
court held that this conduct was not justifiable. The decision is not based on
the ground that the defendants were intentionally inducing, or attempting to
induce, a breach of contract; but on the broad ground that the forcing a neutral
third person to exert a pressure on the plaintiff’s employer was not a
lawful means of competition.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Loring, J.</span><a id='r618'></a><a href='#f618' class='c015'><sup>[618]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>That strike has an element in it like that in a sympathetic strike, in a boycott,
and in a blacklisting, namely: It is a refusal to work for A, with whom
the strikers have no dispute, for the purpose of forcing A to force B to yield
to the strikers’ demands. In the case at bar the strike on the L. P. Soule &amp;
Son Company was a strike on that contractor to force it to force the owner of
the Ford building to give the work of pointing to the defendant unions. That
passes beyond a case of competition where the owner of the Ford building is
left to choose between the two competitors. Such a strike is in effect compelling
the L. P. Soule &amp; Son Company to join in a boycott on the owner of the
Ford building. It is a combination by the union to obtain a decision in their
favor by forcing third persons who have no interest in the dispute to force the
employer to decide the dispute in their (the defendant union’s) favor. Such a
strike is not a justifiable interference with the right of the plaintiffs to pursue
their calling as they think best. In our opinion organized labor’s right of
coercion and compulsion is limited to strikes on persons with whom the organization
has a trade dispute; or to put it in another way, we are of the
opinion that a strike on A, with whom the striker has no trade dispute, to
compel A to force B to yield to the strikers’ demands, is an unjustifiable interference
with the right of A to pursue his calling as he thinks best.<a id='r619'></a><a href='#f619' class='c015'><sup>[619]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>On order to show cause why injunction should not issue.<a id='r620'></a><a href='#f620' class='c015'><sup>[620]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The original complainant was the sole proprietor and publisher of
a daily morning newspaper called the “Newark Times.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendants are eighteen bodies known as “labor unions,” embracing
many trades in the city of Newark, affiliated in a society or
representative body known as “Essex Trades Council.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Essex Trades Council is a voluntary association, composed of
delegates chosen thereto by each of the eighteen defendant unions.
Meetings are held weekly. Every organization represented in the
council is required to make a monthly report of union purchases, and
failing to do so for two consecutive months, its products are not to be
considered as “fair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A circular, issued by the Council in 1893, addressed to the public,
states:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Essex Trades Council has for some time past been concentrating
the trade of its members and those whom these could influence,
upon the goods made and recommended by organized fair labor, and
the stores and places where these goods are sold. The regular system
of purchase reports from individual consumers, transmitted through
their organization, places the council in a position to announce that it
is already turning thousands of dollars of trade every week away from
those indifferent to the welfare of the worker, and into the pockets of
labor’s proven friends. That these friends may receive greater support
by being made more readily known to organized working men and
their many sympathizers among lovers of justice, together forming the
great bulk of the consuming public, the Essex Trades Council will
shortly issue a series of cards for free display in all business establishments
especially deserving the patronage of organized fair consumers,
their families, associates and friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The plan of operation, as developed by the papers and exhibits filed
in the cause, is that each individual member of the different unions is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_999'>999</span>required at stated periods to fill out a blank slip furnished for that
purpose, stating the amount expended by him in purchase, the character
of the articles bought, and the names of the tradesmen with
whom he has dealt. These cards, when filled in, are returned by the
members to their own union, and by the union reported to the council.
A failure by a union to so report for two consecutive months,
places its products under the ban of organized labor as represented in
the council. These reports place the trades council in possession of
data as to the amount of purchases by the members of the unions, and
the tradesmen with whom their dealing is carried on, from which its
officers are enabled to estimate, with some degree of accuracy, the
volume of purchases by the members of the several organizations
within a stated period of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next step is an agreement in writing purporting to be made
between the Essex Trades Council and a tradesman, by which the
latter, “in return for the patronage of united fair consumers,” promises
and agrees to buy as consumer, engage as employer, keep as dealer,
as exclusively as he can, such labor and goods as may be announced
as fair by a particular union and endorsed by the council of consumers
of the Essex Trades Council.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cards are then issued to the tradesmen, under the seal of the trades
council, addressed “to all fair consumers,” each certifying that the
person to whom it is issued “is a fair consuming dealer,” and is entitled
to their fraternal support until a specified date. Coupons are
annexed for certification by particular industries. These cards are of
such size, color and appearance that, if publicly displayed in stores
or places of business, they will attract attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was issued, under date of March 31, 1894, “by the Essex
Trades Council and auxiliary circle bodies,” a small pamphlet of convenient
size to be carried in the pocket, which is entitled “The Fair
List of Newark, N. J.,” and to be “for the information of people who
buy service or product and who have enterprise enough to seek to
place their money where it will do them most good.” It contains
names and addresses of tradesmen and persons in business, including
lawyers, interspersed with items of information and advice.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff Barr determined to employ “plate matter” in making
up part of his daily paper. (This consists of reading matter edited,
set up and stereotyped in New York.) All plaintiff’s employees were
members of the local typographical union. This union had declared
against the use of plate matter in the city of Newark, which fact was
known to Mr. Barr. Through his foreman, he sought to have this
resolution of the union relaxed in favor of his paper, but on its refusal
so to do adhered to his determination, and, by letter dated March 13,
1894, informed his foreman that he would use plate matter on and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1000'>1000</span>after March 17th, saying further, that, not desiring to lose any of the
men in his department, the union scale of wages would be maintained,
and that he would gladly retain the services of such as might be willing
to stay. Some of the employees determined to remain, others, however,
left in consequence of his disregard of the union’s determination,
and the union withdrew its endorsement of the newspaper. The union
thereupon, through its delegates, informed the Essex Trades Council
of this fact and requested its assistance. In response, the council
appointed a committee in reference to the controversy, and, on March
30, 1894, issued a circular addressed to the public, which, after giving
its version of the dispute, concludes with this appeal:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Friends, one and all, leave this council-boycotting ‘Newark
Times’ alone. Cease buying it! Cease handling it! Cease advertising in
it! Keep the money of fair men moving only among fair men.
Boycott the boycotter of organized fair labor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This circular was distributed in the city of Newark.</p>

<p class='c007'>In April, 1894, the trades council issued a small four-page sheet
entitled “The Union Buyer. Official bulletin of united fair custom
of Newark and vicinity. Issued by the Essex Trades Council.” It
is impressed at the heading with the union label. It purports to be
volume I, number 1, issued at Newark, N. J., April, 1894. Its first
announcement is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our mission—To support the supporters and boycott the boycotters
of organized fair labor. To promote the public welfare by the
diffusion of common cents, urging all to carry these in trade only to
those who will return them to the people in the shape of living wages.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole paper is devoted to the controversy between the unions
and the “Newark Times,” no other object being considered. It refers
throughout to that paper either by reversing the letters of the
name “Times” as “Semit,” or by turning the type bottom side up.
The first article after the declaration of its mission is a statement from
Typographical Union No. 103, under the heading of “‘The Times’
Trouble.” The only grievance stated against the “Times” grows out
of the use of plate matter, and ends with “workingmen and advertisers,
remember that plate matter means forty-five cents a day, and
understand why the ‘Newark Times’ is an unfair office.” Then follow
five columns of “Notes and Comments.” These are all directed
to the controversy, and are in vigorous and denunciatory language,
and conclude as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“In conclusion, the council desires to state that the issue between
it and the ‘Semit’ is now wide open. It is a fight between the ‘Semit’
and its supporters and the council and its supporters. We give the
great public absolute freedom in the choice of its side, but not a single
cent of our money will be knowingly let pass to any one who buys the
‘Semit,’ keeps the ‘Semit,’ advertises in the ‘Semit,’ or in any other
way leads us to believe that a portion of our honestly-earned money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1001'>1001</span>may find its way into the pockets to furnish support to the unfair
management of the ‘Semit’ or any of those who have so foully
betrayed the cause of organized fair labor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the foot of this document is placed, in large type, the request,
“When through reading, please pass to your neighbor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This paper was circulated in Newark. There were other publications,
but the defendants deny any responsibility for them, and there
is no evidence to connect them with their issue or circulation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Various labor unions represented in the trades council then passed
a prepared set of resolutions, which were printed and distributed in
Newark. One of these requested all enterprising business houses to
abstain from advertising in the “Times” until the trouble had been
adjusted, stating that hundreds of their friends had refused to buy and
read the “Times,” and that its circulation had become considerably
reduced because of its alleged unfair stand. Another asked such
advertisers as had made contracts with the “Times” for definite
periods, to consider whether it would not be far more advantageous
for them in the end to take out their advertisements, leave their space
entirely blank and pay the few cents their contracts called for, than to
jeopardize thousands of dollars of trade that fair labor would be
“compelled to withhold so long as such advertisements appeared, and
for an indefinite period thereafter,” adding that “those who now continue
to advertise in the ‘Times’ merely succeed in making themselves
conspicuous as persons to carefully and studiously keep away
from.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These resolutions found their way into the hands of the advertisers
in the “Times.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The various trades unions, affiliated in the council, represent, as is
claimed by them, a purchasing power amounting to over $400,000 in
each and every week. Owing to the issue and distribution of the aforesaid
circular and resolutions, the individual members of the union,
and their friends and sympathizers, withheld their patronage from
the “Newark Times.” The circulation of the paper was thereby
considerably reduced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The issue and distribution of said circular and resolutions caused
certain persons, who had theretofore advertised in the “Times,” to
cease advertising in that paper.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Green, V. C.</span></p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c007'>[After stating the testimony of Mr. Beckmeyer, secretary of the
Essex Trades Council, as to the signification of the word “boycott,”
as used in the circular and publications.]</p>

<p class='c007'>From which it is to be gathered that the use of the word “boycott”
in the publications, as applied to the “Times,” would be regarded by
the members of the various unions to mean only that they should refrain
from trading or dealing with the complainant, and with those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1002'>1002</span>who oppose the organizations in their actions and doings with reference
to the complainant.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not see that this changes the character of the injury, but even
if it does, so far as the members of the organizations are concerned,
the difficulty is that these communications were addressed to the public
and indiscriminately circulated. They were not intended only for
members of the order by whom a technical signification would be given
to the word “boycott,” but to the general public who would read them
and give the word its accepted meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'>[After quoting various definitions of “boycott”] Mr. Justice Taft,
in Toledo Co. <em>v.</em> Penn. Co., 54 Fed. Rep. 746, says: “As usually understood
a boycott is a combination of many to cause a loss to one
person by coercing others against their will, to withdraw from him
their beneficial business intercourse, through threats that, unless those
others do so, the many will cause similar loss to them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the defendants insist, and counsel vigorously urge, that this
particular boycott is not open to such adverse criticism, because
“there was no violence, intimidation, coercion or threats used, and
that everything was done in a peaceful and orderly manner.” How far
is this claim borne out by the facts? It is true, there was no public
disturbance, no physical injury, no direct threats of personal violence
or of actual attack on or destruction of tangible property as a means of
intimidation or coercion. Force and violence, however, while they
may enter largely into the question in a criminal prosecution, are not
necessary factors in the right to a civil remedy. But even in criminal
law, I do not understand that intimidation, even when a statutory ingredient
of crime, necessarily presupposes personal injury or the fear
thereof. The clear weight of authority undoubtedly is that a man may
be intimidated into doing, or refraining from doing, by fear of loss
of business, property or reputation, as well as by dread of loss of life,
or injury to health or limb; and the extent of this fear need not be
abject, but only such as to overcome his judgment, or induce him not
to do, or to do, that which otherwise he would have done or have left
undone.</p>

<p class='c007'>There can be no reasonable dispute that the whole proceeding or
boycott in this controversy is to force Mr. Barr, by fear of loss of
business, to conduct that business, not according to his own judgment,
but in accordance with the determination of the typographical union,
and, so far as he is concerned, it is an attempt to intimidate and coerce.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next as to the members of the various labor unions. According to
Mr. Beckmeyer, all the organizations represented in the trades council
and the individual members thereof, in strict conformity with the purpose
and object for which the said council was organized, withheld
their patronage from the said newspaper on the mere announcement
by the typographical union to the trades council that that union had
withdrawn its endorsement from the “Times.” Why? It is said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1003'>1003</span>that it was only the exercise by each person of his right to spend his
money as his own will dictated. The fallacy of this is apparent. It
loses sight of the combination, the whole strength of which lies in the
fact that each individual has surrendered his own discretion and will
to the direction of the accredited representative of all the organizations.
He no longer uses his own judgment, but, by entering into the
combination, agrees to be bound by its decree. As is said in Templeton
<em>v.</em> Russell, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, “those men had bound themselves to obey, and
they knew they had done so, and that if they did not obey they would
be fined, or expelled from the union to which they belonged.” It is
common knowledge, if indeed it does not amply so appear by the
papers in this case, that a member of a labor organization who does not
submit to the edict of his union asserts his independence of judgment
and action at the risk, if not the absolute sacrifice, of all association
with his fellow-members. They will not eat, drink, live or work in his
company. Branded by the peculiarly offensive epithets adopted, he
must exist ostracized, socially and industrially, so far as his former
associates are concerned. Freedom of will under such circumstances
cannot be expected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next as to the advertising public. Tradesmen advertise in newspapers
for the sole purpose of drawing customers to their stores. An
authoritative announcement, not from one, but from many sources,
that the body of organized labor in the city or county representing a
purchasing power of $400,000 a week would cease to deal with those
whose advertisements appeared in the newspaper, would have a much
more deterrent effect than any threat of violence. To say that this is
only advice, or an intimation, to the advertiser for his guidance if he
sees fit to accept it, is trifling with the language. Advice, behind
which lurks the threat of the withdrawal of such a volume of business,
could have no other effect than to intimidate and coerce, as it
did in fact make several change their judgment, which had previously
led them to advertise in the paper. The claim that this boycott
was attempted to be enforced without intimidation or coercion will not
bear the light of examination.</p>

<p class='c007'>A legal excuse for the action of the defendants is next sought in the
claim that the Essex Trades Council is a business institution, and that
what it has done has been in prosecution of such business, seeking, I
suppose, to bring the case within the rule of Mogul Steamship Co. <em>v.</em>
McGregor, 15 Q. B. Div. 476; 23 Q. B. Div. 598. That case proceeded
on the doctrine of a lawful competition in business, both parties being
engaged in carrying on the same character of business, and the acts
complained of having been adopted for the advancement of the defendant’s
own trade, viz., carrying goods on a steamship line, although
thereby damage to the other party necessarily ensued.</p>

<p class='c007'>I see no similarity in the business of these parties. That of the
complainant is the publisher of a newspaper. Members of the typographical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1004'>1004</span>union, and stereotypers’ and pressmen’s union, are skilled
workmen, whose services might be employed in such business, but
they are not carrying on any enterprise in competition with that of
the complainant. So far as the other unions are concerned, the most,
if not all of them, have no connection with such trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither does the claim of the Essex Trades Council, that it is a
business institution, stand on any firmer ground. The only element
of business which it is engaged in would appear from the facts to be
the furnishing to tradesmen of printed cards, certifying that they are
proper persons for the members of trades unions to deal with, suitable
to be displayed in conspicuous places in such tradesmen’s places of
business. This was supplemented by the issue, under date of March
31, 1894, of the small pocket pamphlet entitled “The Fair List of
Newark, N. J.,” containing the names and addresses of tradesmen
and persons in business in Newark, with items of information and
advice. Why this is called a business does not appear. It is not stated
that any compensation is either required or received by the trades
council from the tradespeople for granting or continuing those endorsements,
but whether this is so or not, it is in no sense a competing
business with the publication of a daily newspaper, and therefore does
not come within the principle of the case referred to.</p>

<p class='c007'>The order to show cause, as far as relates to [eight specified organizations],
they having all disclaimed any participation in the acts complained
of, must be discharged, with costs. The said order to show
cause, so far as relates to the other defendants, must be made absolute,
with costs, and an injunction may issue against them, restraining
them from distributing or circulating any circulars, printed resolutions,
bulletins, or other publications containing appeals or threats
against the “Newark Times,” or the complainants, its publishers,
with the design and tending to interfere with their business in publishing
said paper, and from making any threats or using any intimidation
to the dealers or advertisers in such newspaper tending to cause them
to withdraw their business from such newspaper.<a id='r621'></a><a href='#f621' class='c015'><sup>[621]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Henshaw, J.</span> The plaintiff went into equity seeking an injunction
to restrain the defendants from illegal interference with its business.
Plaintiff conducted a livery, board and feed stable in the city and
county of San Francisco. The officers and representatives of defendant

non-union employees and employing union men in their places. Upon
his refusal, a strike of the union men was declared. Following the
strike, a boycott was decreed. A patrol about plaintiffs place of
business was established, and, under the findings, these representatives
of the defendants, the pickets, “called forth in loud, threatening,
and menacing tones to the patrons and customers of plaintiffs not
to patronize plaintiffs in their said business; defendant, the Stablemen’s
Union, through its agents and representatives, has stated to
and threatened patrons and customers and other persons dealing with
plaintiffs that if said patrons and customers and other persons continued
to patronize and do business with plaintiffs, said Stablemen’s
Union would cause them respectively to be boycotted in their business.”
Menacing terms and threatening language were made use of
by the agents, representatives, and pickets of the union toward the
employees of the plaintiffs, such as: “Unfair stable; union men locked
out and non-union men put in; look at this stable, the only unfair
stable on Market Street; the stable that always was and always will
be unfair. This is a scab stable. When we catch you outside, we
will finish you. We will get you yet. It is a scab stable, full of scabs.
We will fix you yet. It is a matter of time when we will get you all
right. You will never get out of the stable alive. We will break you
in half. We will beat you to death. When we catch you outside, we
will finish you.” A judgment for an injunction followed upon these
findings, and that judgment by its terms commanded the defendant,
its agents and employees, to desist and refrain “from in any wise interfering
with, or harassing, or annoying, or obstructing plaintiff in
the conduct of the business of their stable, known as the Nevada
Stables and situated at number 1350 Market Street, in the city and
county of San Francisco; or from in any wise molesting, interfering
with, threatening, intimidating, or harassing any employee or employees
of plaintiffs; or from intimidating, harassing, or interfering
with any customer or customers, patron or patrons of plaintiffs in connection
with the business of plaintiffs, either by boycott or by threats
of boycott, or by any other threats; or by any kind of force, violence,
or intimidation, or by other unlawful means, seeking to induce any
employee or employees of plaintiffs to withdraw from the service of
plaintiffs; or by any kind of violence, threats, or intimidation inducing,
or seeking to induce, any customer or customers, patron or patrons,
of plaintiffs to withdraw their patronage or business from them,
or from stationing or placing in front of said plaintiffs’ place of business
any picket, or pickets, for the purpose of injuring, obstructing, or
in any wise interfering with, the business of plaintiffs, or for the purpose
of preventing any customer or customers, patron or patrons, of
plaintiffs from doing business with them; or from in any other way
molesting, intimidating, or coercing, or attempt to molest or intimidate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1006'>1006</span>or coerce any customer, patron, or employee of plaintiffs now or
hereafter dealing with, or any employee now or hereafter employed by,
or working for plaintiffs in their said business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This appeal is from the judgment. The findings are not attacked.
Certain objections to the complaint are presented upon demurrer, and
these may be briefly disposed of. The complaint is sufficient to invoke
the interposition of a court of equity. It is in this respect similar
to the complaint considered in Goldberg-Bowen Co. <em>v.</em> Stablemen’s
Union, 149 Cal. 429. The complaint alleges specific acts calling for
preventive relief, and is not confined to mere generalities, as was the
case in Davitt <em>v.</em> American Bakers’ Union, 124 Cal. 99. The fact
that certain of the acts charged amount to crimes or threatened crimes,
does not offer reason why equity will refuse to restrain them. While
equity will not attempt to restrain the commission of a crime as such,
the fact that an act threatening irreparable injury to property rights,
is of itself criminal, does not deprive a court of equity of its right and
power to enjoin its commission. (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In re</span></i> Debs, 158 U. S. 564; Sherry
<em>v.</em> Perkins, 144 Mass. 212; Vegelahn <em>v.</em> Guntner, 167 Mass. 92.) In
like manner, while equity will not enjoin against a trespass as such,
yet when the acts committed and threatened are in the nature of a
continuing trespass, working irreparable injury, they will be enjoined.
(Boston R. R. <em>v.</em> Sullivan, 177 Mass. 230; Lembeck <em>v.</em> Nye, 47 Ohio,
336.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Appellants’ principal contentions upon the appeal, however, are the
following: First, that, as the controversy between these parties arises
from and over a trade dispute, the court is powerless to grant any
injunction under the language of “An act to limit the meaning of the
word ‘conspiracy’ and also the use of restraining orders and injunctions
as applied to disputes between employers and employees in the
State of California, approved March 20, 1903” (Pen. Code, page
581); second, that the boycott is a legal weapon in a trade dispute and,
therefore, an injunction should not issue to restrain its use or threatened
use; third, that “picketing” as an adjunct to the boycott is
itself legal and may not be forbidden.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. As to the first of these contentions, this court had occasion in
Goldberg, etc., Co. <em>v.</em> Stablemen’s Union, 149 Cal. 429, to consider the
statute above referred to and relied upon by appellants, and declared
that if the construction there contended for (and here contended for)
was the proper construction, this provision of the court was void. Not
only would it be void as violative of one’s constitutional right to acquire,
possess, enjoy, and protect property, but as well would it be
obnoxious to the constitution in creating arbitrarily and without reason
a class above and beyond the law which is applicable to all other
individuals and classes. It would legalize a combination in restraint
of trade or commerce, entered into by a trades union, which would be
illegal if entered into by any other persons or associations. It would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1007'>1007</span>exempt trades unions from the operation of the general laws of the
land, under circumstances where the same laws would operate against
all other individuals, combinations, or associations. It is thus not only
special legislation, obnoxious to the constitution (Art. IV, sec. 25,
subds. 3 and 33), but it still further violates the constitution in attempting
to grant privileges and immunities to certain citizens or
classes of citizens which, upon the same terms, have not been granted
to all citizens (Art. I, sec. 21).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. In considering the second proposition, whether or not a court of
equity may enjoin a boycott, the meaning of the word is of primary
importance. It is defined in 4 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law, 2d ed., page
85, as follows: “The boycott is a conspiracy, the direct object of which
is to occasion loss to the party or parties against whom the conspiracy
is directed, and the means commonly used is the inducing of others
to withdraw from such party or parties their patronage and business
intercourse by threats that, unless they so withdraw, the members of
the combination will cause, directly or indirectly, loss of a similar
character to them.” Appellants announce their willingness to accept
this definition, substituting the word “confederacy” or “combination”
for “conspiracy.” But the definition, even as so amended, it
will be noted is not complete. The “means commonly used” are
specified, but other means may be and frequently are employed. A
boycott may adopt illegal means and thus become a “conspiracy,” a
word which imports illegality; or a boycott may employ legal means
and methods, and thus be merely a legitimate combination by a number
of men to accomplish, within the law, a legal result. The crux
of the question and the strain in every case turns, then, upon the
means employed. We think that to-day no court would question the
right of an organized union of employes, by concerted action, to cease
their employment (no contractual obligation standing in the way),
and this action constitutes a “strike.” We think, moreover, that no
court questions the right of those same men to cease dealing by concerted
action, either socially or by way of business, with their former
employer, and this latter act, in its essence, constitutes the “primary
boycott.” But what acts organized labor may do, and what means it
may adopt to accomplish its end, without violation of the law, have
presented questions of much nicety, over which the courts have
stood, and still stand, widely divided. It would not be profitable to
discuss and analyze these widely divergent cases. It is sufficient to
formulate briefly the principles adopted in this state, many of which
have recently found elaborate expression in the case of Parkinson <em>v.</em>
Building &amp; Trades Council of Santa Clara, 36 Cal. Dec. 445. The
right of united labor to strike, in furtherance of their trade interests
(no contractual obligation standing in the way) is fully recognized.
The reason for the strike may be based upon the refusal to comply
with the employees’ demand for the betterment of wages, conditions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1008'>1008</span>hours of labor, the discharge of one employee, the engagement of
another—any one of the multifarious ends which in good faith may
be believed to tend toward the advancement of the employees. After
striking, the employees may engage in a boycott, as that word is here
employed. As here employed it means not only the concerted right
to the withdrawal of social and business intercourse, but the right by
all legitimate means of fair publication, and fair oral or written persuasion,
to induce others interested in or sympathetic with their
cause, to withdraw their social intercourse and business patronage
from the employer. They may go even further than this, and request
of another that he withdraw his patronage from the employer, and
may use the moral intimidation and coercion of threatening a like
boycott against him if he refuse so to do. This last proposition necessarily
involves the bringing into a labor dispute between A and B, C
who has no difference with either. It contemplates that C, upon the
demand of B, and under the moral intimidation lest B boycott him,
may thus be constrained to withdraw his patronage from A, with
whom he has no controversy. This is the “secondary boycott,” the
legality of which is vigorously denied by the English courts, the federal
courts, and by the courts of many of the states of this nation. Without
presenting the authorities, which are multitudinous, suffice it to
state the other view in language of the President of the United States
but recently uttered: “A body of workmen are dissatisfied with the
terms of their employment. They seek to compel their employer to
come to their terms by striking. They may legally do so. The loss
and inconvenience he suffers he cannot complain of. But when they
seek to compel third persons, who have no quarrel with their employer,
to withdraw from all association with him by threats that, unless such
third persons do so, the workmen will inflict similar injury on such
third persons, the combination is oppressive, involves duress, and if
injury results, it is actionable.” (President Taft, McClure’s Magazine,
June, 1909, page 204.) Notwithstanding the great dignity
which attaches to an utterance such as this, which, as has been said, is
but the expression of numerous courts upon the subject-matter, this
court, after great deliberation, took what it believed to be the truer
and more advanced ground above indicated and fully set forth in
Parkinson <em>v.</em> Building &amp; Trades Council, etc., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>. In this respect
this court recognizes no substantial distinction between the so-called
primary and secondary boycott. Each rests upon the right of the
union to withdraw its patronage from its employer and to induce by
fair means any and all other persons to do the same, and in the exercise
of those means, as the unions would have the unquestioned right to
withhold their patronage from a third person who continued to deal
with their employer, so they have the unquestioned right to notify
such third person that they will withdraw their patronage if he continues
so to deal. However opposed to the weight of federal authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1009'>1009</span>the views of this court are, that they are not unique may be noted by
reading National Protective Association <em>v.</em> Cumming, 170 N. Y. 315;
Lindsay <em>v.</em> Montana Federation of Labor, (Mont.) 18 L. R. A. (<span class='fss'>N. S.</span>)
707, where the highest courts of those states formulate and adopt like
principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said that it is important to any correct understanding
of or adjudication upon such questions that a definition of the word
“boycott” should be first stated. Thus, to say that a boycott is a
“conspiracy” immediately implies illegality, and puts the conduct of
the boycotters under the ban of the law. So also does the definition
which describes boycotting as “illegal coercion” designed to accomplish
a certain end. As we have undertaken to define boycott, it is an
organized effort to persuade or coerce, which may be legal or illegal,
according to the means employed. In other jurisdictions where a definition
is given to a boycott which imports illegality the injunction
will of course lie against boycotting as such. In this state the injunction
will issue, depending upon the circumstances whether the means
employed, or threatened to be employed, are legal or illegal.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. We are thus brought to consider the method of “picketing,” the
use of which appellants contend is a legal weapon in their hands. So
far in this discussion we have dealt exclusively with the respective
rights of the employer and of the employee. There are other parties,
however, whose rights are entitled to equal consideration, and whose
rights always become involved and imperilled when picketing is
adopted as a coercive measure in aid of a boycott.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the strikers have the right, as above indicated, to withdraw
patronage themselves and by fair publication, written and oral persuasion
to induce others to join in their cause, and finally by threat
of like boycott to coerce others into so doing, their rights go no further
than this. It is the equal right of the employer to insist before the
law that his business shall be subject at the hands of the strikers to
no other detriment than that which follows as a consequence of the
legal acts of the strikers so above set forth. It is not to be forgotten
that when the employees have struck, they occupy no contractual relationship
whatsoever to their former employer, and have no right to
coerce him or attempt to coerce him by the employment of any other
means than those which are equally open to any other individual or
association of individuals. No sanctity attaches to a trades union
which puts it above the law, or which confers upon it rights not enjoyed
by any other individual or association. The two classes of persons
to whom we have adverted and whose rights necessarily become
involved where a picket or patrol is established, are, first, the rights of
those employed or seeking employment in the place of the striking
laborers, and, second, the rights of the general public. It is the absolute,
unqualified right of every employee, as well as of every other
person, to go about his legal business unmolested and unobstructed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1010'>1010</span>and free from intimidation, force, or duress. The right of a labor
association to strike is no higher than the right of a non-union workman
to take employment in place of the strikers. Under the assurance
and shield of the Constitution and of the laws, the non-union
laborer may go to and from his labor and remain at his place of labor
in absolute security from unlawful molestations, and wherever the
laws fail to accord such protection, in so far is their execution to be
blamed. In this country a man’s constitutional liberty means far
more than his mere personal freedom. It means that, among other
rights, his is the right freely to labor and to own the fruits of his toil.
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex parte</span></i> Jentzsch, 112 Cal. 468.) Any act of boycotting, therefore,
which tends to impair this constitutional right freely to labor, by
means passing beyond moral suasion, and playing by intimidation
upon the physical fears, is unlawful.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inconvenience which the public may suffer by reason of a boycott
lawfully conducted is in no sense a legal injury. But the public’s
rights are invaded the moment the means employed are such as are
calculated to and naturally do incite to crowds, riots, and disturbances
of the peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>A picket, in its very nature, tends to accomplish, and is designed to
accomplish, these very things. It tends to and is designed, by physical
intimidation, to deter other men from seeking employment in the
places vacated by the strikers. It tends, and is designed, to drive business
away from the boycotted place, not by the legitimate methods
of persuasion, but by the illegitimate means of physical intimidation
and fear. Crowds naturally collect; disturbances of the peace are
always imminent and of frequent occurrence. Many peaceful citizens,
men and women, are always deterred by physical trepidation from
entering places of business so under a boycott patrol. It is idle to
split hairs upon so plain a proposition, and to say that the picket
may consist of nothing more than a single individual peacefully endeavoring
by persuasion to prevent customers from entering the boycotted
place. The plain facts are always at variance with such
refinements of reason. Says Chief Justice Shaw in Commonwealth
<em>v.</em> Hunt, 4 Met. 111: “The law is not to be hoodwinked by colorable
pretences; it looks at truth and reality through whatever disguise it
may assume.” If it be said that neither threats nor intimidations are
used, no man can fail to see that there may be threats, and there may
be intimidations, and there may be molesting, and there may be obstructing,
without there being any express words used by which a man
should show violent threats toward another, or any express intimidation.
We think it plain that the very end to be attained by picketing,
however artful may be the means to accomplish that end, is the injury
of the boycotted business through physical molestation and physical
fear caused to the employer, to those whom he may have employed
or who may seek employment from him, and to the general public.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1011'>1011</span>The boycott, having employed these means for this unquestioned purpose,
is illegal, and a court will not seek by over-niceties and refinements
to legalize the use of this unquestionably illegal instrument.
(Vegelahn <em>v.</em> Guntner, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, Crump <em>v.</em> Commonwealth, 84 Va. 927;
Union Pacific <em>v.</em> Ruef, 120 Fed. Rep. 124; 18 Ency. of Law, 2d ed.,
page 85.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In conclusion, then, and applying these principles to the injunction
here under consideration, it appears that, while the injunction was
properly granted, it was broader in its terms than the law warrants.
It was, for example, too broad in restraining defendants from “in any
wise interfering with” plaintiff’s business, since the interference which
we have discussed, of publication, reasonable persuasion, and threat
to withdraw patronage, is legal and such as defendants could employ.
So, also, was the injunction too broad in restraining defendants from
“intimidating any customer by boycott or threat of boycott,” since,
as has been said, the secondary boycott is likewise a legal weapon. In
all other respects, however, the injunction was proper.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trial court is directed to modify its injunction in the particulars
here specified, and in all other respects the judgment will stand
affirmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>We concur: <span class='sc'>Lorigan, J.</span>; <span class='sc'>Beatty, C. J.</span>; <span class='sc'>Melvin, J.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Shaw, J.</span> I agree with all that is said by Justice Henshaw in his
opinion, except the part relating to the so-called “secondary boycott”
and the attempt to draw a distinction between the compulsion of third
persons caused by picketing, and the compulsion of third persons produced
by a boycott. My views concerning the “secondary boycott”
are expressed in my dissenting opinion in Parkinson <em>v.</em> Building
Trades Council, (Cal.) 98 Pac. 1040. The means employed for the
coercion or intimidation of a third person in a “secondary boycott”
are unlawful whenever they are such as are calculated to, and actually
do, destroy his free will and cause him to act contrary to his own
volition in his own business, to the detriment of the person toward
whom the main boycott or strike is directed; in other words, whenever
the means used constitute duress, menace, or undue influence.
Whether this coercion or compulsion comes from fear of physical
violence, as in the case of picketing, or from fear of financial loss, as in
the secondary boycott, or from fear of any other infliction, is, in my
opinion, immaterial, so long as the fear is sufficiently potent to control
the action of those upon whom it is cast. I can see no logical or just
reason for the distinction thus sought to be made. There is no such
distinction in cases where contracts or wills are declared void, because
procured by duress, menace, or undue influence. There should be
none where actual injury is produced or threatened through such
means acting upon third persons. Nor do I believe any well-considered
case authorizes any such distinction. The opinions in the case
of National Protective Association <em>v.</em> Cummings, 170 N. Y. 315, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1012'>1012</span>devoted to a discussion of the right to strike and the limitations of
that right and not to a discussion of the “secondary boycott.” A
close analysis of the cases on the subject will, as I believe, show that
this court stands alone on this point.</p>

<p class='c007'>For these reasons I do not agree to that part of the judgment directing
a modification of the injunction. I believe that it should stand in
the form as given by the court below.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Angellotti, J.</span>, and <span class='sc'>Sloss, J.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>We concur in the judgment. The modification of the judgment is
in line with the views announced in the Parkinson case. So far as
“picketing” is concerned, while we are not prepared to hold that
there may not be acts coming within that term as it is accepted and
understood in labor disputes, that are entirely lawful and should not
be enjoined, we believe that as to such “picketing” as is described in
both findings and judgment in this case, the views expressed in the
opinion of the court are correct.<a id='r622'></a><a href='#f622' class='c015'><sup>[622]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“Ignominious treatment is an injury only when it is an infringement of one of
the absolute rights of personality: a right that is recognized by the law of the
State as included amongst the natural rights of every freeman. Such an infringement
of another’s right may be regarded as offensive to good morals (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">contra bonos

<p class='c007'>A lunatic has been held liable under a statute giving an action to the widow and

<p class='c007'>In McIntyre <em>v.</em> Sholty, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, Magruder, J., said, p. 664: “It is well settled
that, though a lunatic is not punishable criminally, he is liable in a civil action for
any tort he may commit. However justly this doctrine may have been originally
subject to criticism on the grounds of reason and principle, it is now too firmly supported
by the weight of authority to be disturbed. It is the outcome of the principle,
that, in trespass, the intent is not conclusive. Mr. Sedgwick, in his work on
Damages (margin, p. 456), says that, on principle, a lunatic should not be held
liable for his tortious acts. Opposed to this view, however, is a majority of the
decisions and text writers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So long as the primitive notion prevailed that the doer of harm was absolutely
responsible therefor, the insanity of the doer could afford no defence, either to a
criminal prosecution or a civil action. 7 Harv. L. Rev. 446. When this notion was
so far modified that misadventure or accident on the part of the doer became a defence,
it would have been entirely logical for the courts to treat the acts or the
omissions of lunatics as involuntary, and consequently not tortious but accidental.”
Burdick, Torts (2d ed.), 60. See also Ames, Law and Morals, 22 Harv.

<p class='c007'>“827. A person who causes damage to another while in a condition of unconsciousness

<p class='c007'>“829. A person who&#160;... is by virtue of 827&#160;... not responsible for any
damage caused by him shall nevertheless where compensation cannot be obtained
from a third party charged with the duty of supervision make compensation for
damage in so far as according to the circumstances (e. g. according to the relative

Kline, 158 Ind. 602; Williams <em>v.</em> Underhill, 63 App. Div. 223; Leach <em>v.</em> Leach, 11
Tex. Civ. App. 699. It must be shown that there was causal connection between
the fright and the shock. Hack <em>v.</em> Dady, 142 App. Div. 510.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Homans <em>v.</em> Boston Co., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, the court said, through Holmes, C. J.: “As
has been explained repeatedly, it is an arbitrary exception, based upon a notion of
what is practicable, that prevents a recovery for visible illness resulting from
nervous shock alone. Spade <em>v.</em> Lynn Co.; Smith <em>v.</em> Postal Co., 174 Mass. 576.
But when there has been a battery and the nervous shock results from the same
wrongful management as the battery, it is at least equally impracticable to go
further and to inquire whether the shock comes through the battery or along with
it. Even were it otherwise, recognizing as we must the logic in favor of the plaintiff
when a remedy is denied because the only immediate wrong was a shock to the
nerves, we think that when the reality of the cause is guaranteed by proof of a substantial
battery of the person there is no occasion to press further the exception to
general rules.” See also Spade <em>v.</em> Lynn Co., 172 Mass. 690, per Holmes, C. J.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Liability for frightening an Animal to Death.</em> The doctrine of the principal case
was carried so far in Lee <em>v.</em> Burlington, 113 Ia., 356, that no recovery was allowed
for the death of a horse from fright caused by the careless conduct of the defendant.
But the opposite view prevailed in Louisville R. Co. <em>v.</em> Melton, 158 Ala. 509,
and Conklin <em>v.</em> Thompson, 29 Barb. 218.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r56'>56</a>. “On principle, the distinction between cases of physical impact or lesion being
necessary as a ground of liability for damage caused seems to have nothing in its
favour—always on the footing that the causal connection between the injury and
the occurrence is established. If compensation is to be recovered under the statute
or at common law in respect of an occurrence which has caused dislocation of a
limb, on what principle can it be denied if the same occurrence has caused unhinging of the mind? The personal injury in the latter case may be infinitely graver
than in the former, and to what avail—in the incidence of justice, or the principle
of law—is it to say that there is a distinction between things physical and
mental?  This is the broadest difference of all, and it carries with it no principle of
legal distinction. Indeed it may be suggested that the proposition that injury so
produced to the mind is unaccompanied by physical affection or change might
itself be met by modern physiology or pathology with instant challenge.” Lord

right to require of another; and that degree of care becomes increased with any
increase of the apparent danger involved in its absence or with the increased

carrier of passengers either by rail or by water has so complete a control and
the consequences of negligence on his part may be so serious that he is justly held
to a very high degree of care for their safety; and accordingly it has been often
said, both in this and in other jurisdictions, that he is held to the exercise of the
highest degree of care. But as was pointed out in Dodge <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Bangor
Steamship Co., 148 Mass. 207, 217, 218, this phrase and similar words which have
been used to convey the same idea mean simply that the carrier is bound to use the
utmost care consistent with the nature of his undertaking and with a due regard
for all other matters that ought to be considered in conducting the business. This
conductor was not bound absolutely to exercise the highest degree of care in
running his car, but only the highest degree of care which was consistent with the
practical performance of all his duties in seeing that the car was run safely without
unreasonable delays, and so as to provide for the safety and convenience and
properly rapid transit of his passengers. What was required of him was the highest
degree of care consistent with the practical management and operation of his car
for the carriage of passengers, ‘or in other words, the requirement [was] reasonable
care according to the nature of the contract’ with the passengers.” Sheldon, J.,

case as the ordinary prudent man would put forth under the same circumstances,
seems to meet the demands of every conceivable case.... The ratio of diligence
to circumstances being thus fixed, the two extremes may change to an infinite
extent without destroying the ratio, and without giving rise to what we term
negligence. The bailee who undertakes the carriage of stone for the paving of a
street is held to the rule that he must use such attention and effort as the ordinary
prudent man would use under like circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The bailee, who undertakes to repair a delicate watch, is held to the rule that
he must use such attention and effort as the ordinary prudent man would use under
the same circumstances. The contract of the watchmaker is the same, relatively,
as that of the hod-carrier. Each contracts to provide the reasonable ordinary skill
and attention which a man in his position would exercise under like circumstances.
The ratio, proportion, or correspondence of diligence to circumstances, of care to
surroundings, is fixed and identical. And in determining a question of diligence or
negligence in either case, it would be only necessary to apply the same rule to
varying circumstances and persons, to demand the same ratio between varying
extremes. And it is not too much to assert that all the perplexity and misunderstanding
on the subject of diligence and negligence are due to the habit of confounding
the specific acts and circumstances, which must always vary, with the
ratio or relation between them, which remains always the same. It is true that
there <em>may</em> be different ratios of effort and attention to the circumstances and to the
results desired. A man may contract to furnish the highest skill, the most perfect
means and appliances, the most assiduous attention in the accomplishment of a
specific end. But, when an individual so contracts, there is the element of <em>special</em>
or <em>positive</em> intention introduced, which takes the case out of the category of diligence,
and renders such a contract a special and extraordinary one. The law never
requires such a special, positive intention....” 6 Albany Law Journ. 313, 314.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r77'>77</a>. A fuller statement of the views of the learned judge may be found in the
extracts, which follow, from his work on Bailments:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Section 11. [On the subject of the various degrees of care or diligence which
are recognized in the common law.]... There may be a high degree of diligence,
a common degree of diligence, and a slight degree of diligence;...”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Common or ordinary diligence is that degree of diligence which men in general
exact in respect to their own concerns.... That may be said to be common
or ordinary diligence, in the sense of the law, which men of common prudence
generally exercise about their own affairs in the age and country in which they
live.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Section 16. Having thus ascertained the nature of ordinary diligence, we may
now be prepared to decide upon the other two degrees. High or great diligence is
of course extraordinary diligence, or that which very prudent persons take of their
own concerns; and low or slight diligence is that which persons of less than common
prudence, or indeed of any prudence at all, take of their own concerns. Sir
William Jones considers the latter to be the exercise of such diligence as a man of
common sense, however inattentive, takes of his own concerns. Perhaps this is expressing
the measure a little too loosely; for a man may possess common sense,
nay, uncommon sense, and yet be so grossly inattentive to his own concerns as to
deserve the appellation of having no prudence at all. The measure is rather to be
drawn from the diligence which men, habitually careless or of little prudence (not
‘however inattentive’ they may be), generally take in their own concerns.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Section 17. Having, then, arrived at the three degrees of diligence, we are
naturally led to those of negligence, which correspond thereto; for negligence may
be ordinary, or less than ordinary, or more than ordinary. Ordinary negligence
may be defined to be the want of ordinary diligence, and slight negligence to be the
want of great diligence, and gross negligence to be the want of slight diligence. For
he who is only less diligent than very careful men cannot be said to be more than
slightly inattentive; he who omits ordinary care is a little more negligent than men
ordinarily are; and he who omits even slight diligence fails in the lowest degree of
prudence, and is deemed grossly negligent....” Story on Bailments (8th ed.),
§§ 11, 16, 17.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The theory that there are three degrees of negligence described by the terms
slight, ordinary, and gross, has been introduced into the common law from some of
the commentators on the Roman law. It may be doubted if these terms can be
usefully applied in practice. Their meaning is not fixed, or capable of being so.
One degree, thus described, not only may be confounded with another, but it is quite
impracticable exactly to distinguish them. Their signification necessarily varies
according to circumstances, to whose influence the courts have been forced to
yield, until there are so many real exceptions that the rules themselves can scarcely
be said to have a general operation. In Storer <em>v.</em> Gowen, 18 Maine, 177, the Supreme
Court of Maine says: ‘How much care will, in a given case, relieve a party
from the imputation of gross negligence, or what omission will amount to the
charge, is necessarily a question of fact, depending on a great variety of circumstances
which the law cannot exactly define.’ Mr. Justice Story, Bailments, § 11,
says: ‘Indeed, what is common or ordinary diligence is more a matter of fact than
of law.’ If the law furnishes no definition of the terms gross negligence, or ordinary
negligence, which can be applied in practice, but leaves it to the jury to determine,
in each case, what the duty was, and what omissions amount to a breach of it, it
would seem that imperfect and confessedly unsuccessful attempts to define that
duty had better be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Recently, the judges of several courts have expressed their disapprobation of
these attempts to fix the degrees of diligence by legal definitions, and have complained
of the impracticability of applying them. Wilson <em>v.</em> Brett, 11 Meeson and
Wels. 113; Wyld <em>v.</em> Pickford, 8 ibid. 443, 461, 462; Hinton <em>v.</em> Dibbin, 2 Q. B. 646,
651. It must be confessed that the difficulty in defining gross negligence, which is
apparent in perusing such cases as Tracy et al. <em>v.</em> Wood, 3 Mason 132, and Foster <em>v.</em>
The Essex Bank, 17 Mass. 479, would alone be sufficient to justify these complaints.
It may be added that some of the ablest commentators on the Roman
law, and on the civil code of France have wholly repudiated this theory of three
degrees of diligence, as unfounded in principles of natural justice, useless in practice,
and presenting inextricable embarrassments and difficulties. See Toullier’s
Droit Civil, 6th vol., p. 239, etc.; 11th vol., p. 203, etc.; Makeldey, Man. Du
Droit Romain, 191.” Curtis, J., in Steamboat <em>v.</em> King, 16 How. 469, 474 (injury
to gratuitous passenger).</p>

<p class='c007'>“Confusion has arisen from regarding negligence as a positive instead of a negative
word. It is really the absence of such care as it was the duty of the defendant
to use. A bailee is only bound to use the ordinary care of a man, and so the absence
of it is called gross negligence. A person who undertakes to do some work for reward
to an article must exercise the care of a skilled workman, and the absence of
such care in him is negligence. Gross, therefore, is a word of description, and not
a definition; and it would have been only introducing a source of confusion to use
the expression gross negligence, instead of the equivalent, a want of due care and
skill in navigating the vessel, which was again and again used by the Lord Chief
Justice in his summing up.” Willes, J., in Grill <em>v.</em> General Collier Co., L. R. 1 C. P.

<p class='c007'>Children are seldom made defendants in actions for negligence. Most of the discussions
as to the standard of care required of children are to be found in cases
where the children, or their parents or representatives, were plaintiffs seeking to
recover for damage to the children alleged to be caused by defendant’s negligence,
and where the defendant contended that the action was barred by the contributory
negligence of the child. A good discussion where defendant was an infant may

and restraint, and that their curiosity and restlessness have a tendency to get
them into positions of danger. There is some point in every life where these conditions
are present in such degree as to deprive the child of capacity to assume risk
intelligently, or to be guilty of negligence consciously. That point varies in different
children for divers reasons. There is no hard and fast rule that at any
particular age a minor is presumed to be able to comprehend risks or to be capable
of negligence. Extreme cases can be stated which obviously fall on one side or the
other of the line. In some jurisdictions it has been held that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> a child
under fourteen years of age is presumed not to be capable of contributory negligence.

his minor child, committed in his absence and without his authority or approval,
but the minor is answerable therefor. Tifft <em>v.</em> Tifft, 4 Denio, 177. The minor is not
exempt from liability, though the trespass was committed by the express command
of the father. Humphrey <em>v.</em> Douglass, 10 Vt. 71.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor can the defendant derive any support from the scriptural injunction to
children of obedience to their parents, invoked in defence. No such construction
can be given to the command, ‘Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is
right,’ as to sanction or justify the trespass of the son upon the land of another, and
the asportation of his crops, even though done by the express commands of his
father. The defence is as unsound in its theology as it is baseless in its law.”

<p class='c007'>May, J., dissented, saying: “I am not quite satisfied with either the law or the
theology of the opinion in this case. That sins of ignorance may be winked at, is
both a dictate of reason and of Scripture. It is true, as a general rule, that infants
who have arrived at the age of discretion are liable for their tortious acts. But, for
the protection of infants, ought not the rule to be limited to cases where the infant
acts under such circumstances that <em>he must know or be presumed to know</em> that the
acts which he commits are unauthorized and wrong, when it appears that in the
commission of the acts he was under the control and direction of his father? Will
not an opposite doctrine tend to encourage disobedience in the child, and thus be
subversive of the best interests of the community? Will it not also tend to subject
him to embarrassment and insolvency when he shall arrive at full age? If all the
members of a family under age are to be held liable in trespass or trover for the food
which they eat, when that food is in fact the property of another, but, being set before
them, they partake of it, in ignorance of such fact, by the command or direction
of the parent, and under the belief that it is his, will not such a doctrine be in
conflict with the principle that the common law is intended as a shield and protection
against the improvidence of infancy? While the decided cases upon this
subject seem to be limited to cases of contract, is there not the same reason for extending
it, and applying it to cases like the one before us? In all the cases which I
have examined in which infants have been held liable, the proof shows acts of
positive wrong committed under circumstances where the infant must have known
the nature and character of his acts. If the doctrines of the opinion are to prevail
in a case like this, then the common law is but the revival of the old doctrine that
the parents, by eating sour grapes, have set the children’s teeth on edge. The
rule that a servant who acts in ignorance of the rights of his principal is to be held
liable for his acts, does not fall within the principles for which I contend.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r93'>93</a>. This decision and Bridges <em>v.</em> North London R. Co., L. R. 7 H. L. 213, put an
end in England to a conflict of authority as to the power of the judge to withdraw
the case from the jury where there was an “invitation to alight” or “slamming
the door” of a compartment car. See the cases cited in 21 Halsbury, Laws of
England, 445.</p>

<p class='c007'>A like question, much discussed in the United States, is: A man, without looking
or listening, attempts to cross the track of a steam railway, and is hit by a
negligently managed engine. Should the judge rule that crossing without looking
and listening (or crossing without stopping, looking, and listening) is, as matter of
law, negligent conduct? Or should the judge tell the jury that such conduct is
evidence from which negligence <em>may be</em> inferred, and that it is for them to say
whether they <em>do</em> infer it? As to this, there is a conflict of authority. See discussion
and collected cases in 3 Elliott on Railroads (1st ed.) § 1167; 2 Thompson,

<p class='c007'>“There are many cases that hold that an unexplained accident with a machine,
not liable to occur if such machine was properly constructed and in a proper state
of repair, is evidence of negligence; as in Spaulding <em>v.</em> C. &amp; N. W. R. Co., 30 Wis.
110, where it was held that the escape of fire from a passing locomotive engine,
sufficient to cause damage, raised a presumption of improper construction or insufficient
repair or negligent handling of such engine. To the same effect are
Cummings <em>v.</em> Nat. Furnace Co., 60 Wis. 603; Kurz &amp; Huttenlocher Ice Co. <em>v.</em>
M. &amp; N. R. Co., 84 Wis. 171; Stacy <em>v.</em> M., L. S. &amp; W. R. Co., 85 Wis. 225; Mullen

<em>v.</em> Rogers, 120 N. Y. 526, and many others that might be cited. Such cases
lay down a very well-recognized principle in the law of negligence, but do not&#160;...
conflict in the slightest degree with numerous authorities that go on another principle,
just as well-recognized and firmly established, to the effect that undisputed
proof of freedom of the machine from all discoverable defects, either in construction
or repair, effectually overcomes any mere inference or presumption arising
from the happening of the accident, so as to leave no question in that regard for
the jury; as in Spaulding <em>v.</em> C. &amp; N. W. R. Co., 33 Wis. 582, where this court held
the inference that a locomotive engine was defective, arising merely from the
escape of fire therefrom sufficient to cause damage, rebutted by conclusive proof
that the engine was free from discoverable defects, so as to leave nothing on that
point for the consideration of a jury.” Marshall, J., Vorbrich <em>v.</em> Geuder Co., 96

<p class='c007'><a href='#r99'>99</a>. “There was much discussion by counsel of the doctrine of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i> and
its relevancy to the facts of this case. The thing speaks for itself, is a principle
applied by the law where under the circumstances shown the accident presumably
would not have occurred in the use of a machine if due care had been exercised, or,
in the case of an elevator, when in its normal operation after due inspection. The
doctrine does not dispense with the requirement that the party who alleges negligence
must prove the fact, but relates only to the mode of proving it. The fact of
the accident furnishes merely some evidence to go to the jury, which requires the
defendant ‘to go forward with his proof.’ The rule of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i> does not
relieve the plaintiff of the burden of showing negligence, nor does it raise any presumption
in his favor. Whether the defendant introduces evidence or not, the
plaintiff in this case will not be entitled to a verdict unless he satisfies the jury by
the preponderance of the evidence that his injuries were caused by a defect in the
elevator attributable to the defendant’s negligence. The law attaches no special
weight, as proof, to the fact of an accident, but simply holds it to be sufficient for
the consideration of the jury even in the absence of any additional evidence.
Womble <em>v.</em> Grocery Co., 135 N. C. 474; 2 Labatt on Master &amp; Servant, § 834; 4
Wigmore on Evidence, § 2509. In all other respects, the parties stand before the
jury just as if there was no such rule. The judge should carefully instruct the jury
as to the application of the principle, so that they will not give to the fact of the
accident any greater artificial weight than the law imparts to it. Wigmore, in the
section just cited, says the following considerations ought to limit the doctrine of
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ipsa loquitur</span></i>: 1. The apparatus must be such that in the ordinary instance no
injurious operation is to be expected unless from a careless construction, inspection,
or user; 2. Both inspection and user must have been, at the time of the injury,
in the control of the party charged; 3. The injurious occurrence must have happened
irrespective of any voluntary action at the time by the party injured. He
says further that the doctrine is to some extent founded upon the fact that the
chief evidence of the true cause of the injury, whether culpable or innocent, is
practically accessible to the party charged and perhaps inaccessible to the party
injured. What are the general limits of the doctrine and what is the true reason
for its adoption, we will not now undertake to decide. It is established in the law
as a rule for our guidance and must be enforced whenever applicable, and to the
extent that it is applicable, to the facts of the particular case.” Walker, J., in

sometimes said that it warrants a presumption of negligence, but the presumption
referred to is not one of law, but of fact. It is, however, more correct and less confusing to refer to it as an inference, rather than a presumption, and not an inference

<p class='c007'>“A railway company may lawfully require a wilful trespasser upon one of its
moving trains to immediately cease his unlawful conduct, by such means as not to
indicate a willingness to deprive him of his self-control in leaving the train, the
speed of the train not being so great that a personal injury to him should be expected
to occur, giving due consideration to the duty of the trespasser to cease his
lawlessness by all reasonable means in his power and reasonable expectation that
he will use such means in attempting to do it. It is not sufficient to indicate an
intentional injury that the party causing it had reasonable ground to expect that
such a result was within reasonable probabilities, otherwise a violation of the duty
to exercise ordinary care would, of itself, be sufficient to indicate such injury. The
danger of inflicting a personal injury upon a person by the conduct of another must
be such as to reasonably permit of a belief that such other either contemplated
producing it, or, being conscious of the danger that it would occur, imposed such
danger upon that person in utter disregard of the consequences, to warrant saying,
reasonably, that the circumstances indicate willingness to perpetrate such injury.”

<p class='c007'><a href='#r140'>140</a>. See Latham <em>v.</em> Johnson, [1913] 1 K. B. 398. In that case Hamilton, L. J., said
(pp. 415–416): “Two other terms must be alluded to—a ‘trap’ and ‘attraction’
or ‘allurement.’ A trap is a figure of speech, not a formula. It involves the
idea of concealment and surprise, of an appearance of safety under circumstances
cloaking a reality of danger. Owners and occupiers alike expose licensees and
visitors to traps on their premises at their peril, but a trap is a relative term. In
the case of an infant, there are moral as well as physical traps. There may accordingly
be a duty towards infants not merely not to dig pitfalls for them, but
not to lead them into temptation. ‘Allurements,’ too, is a vague word. It may
refer only to the circumstances under which the injured child has entered the close.
Here it is hard to see how infantile temptations can give rights, however much
they may excuse peccadilloes. A child will be a trespasser still, if he goes on private
ground without leave or right, however natural it may have been for him to
do so. On the other hand, the allurement may arise after he has entered with
leave or as of right. Then the presence in a frequented place of some object of
attraction, tempting him to meddle where he ought to abstain, may well constitute
a trap, and in the case of a child too young to be capable of contributory negligence
it may impose full liability on the owner or occupier, if he ought, as a reasonable
man, to have anticipated the presence of the child and the attractiveness and
peril of the object.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Finally, what objects which attract infants to their hurt are traps even to
them? Not all objects with which children hurt themselves simpliciter. A child
can get into mischief and hurt itself with anything if it is young enough. In some
cases the answer may rest with the jury, but it must be matter of law to say
whether a given object can be a trap in the double sense of being fascinating and
fatal. No strict answer has been, or perhaps ever will be, given to the question,
but I am convinced that a heap of paving stone in broad daylight in a private close
cannot so combine the properties of temptation and retribution as to be properly
called a trap.”</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Liability in case of gratuitous carriage</em>: [The judge at the trial in charging the
jury] “suggested that the measure of duty towards a bare licensee is different,
where the licensor accepts the duty of carrying him, from what it is where he
merely permits him to pass through his premises; and I think the cases support
this view.... I think it was competent for the jury to find, as they must be
taken to have found, a failure of that ordinary care which is due from a person who
undertakes the carriage of another gratuitously. The principle in all cases of this
class is that the care exercised must be reasonable; and the standard of reasonableness
naturally must vary according to the circumstances of the case, the trust reposed,
and the skill and appliances at the disposal of the person to whom another
confides a duty. There is an obvious difference between the measure of confidence
reposed and responsibility accepted in the case of a person who merely receives permission
to traverse the premises of another, and in the case where a person or his
property is received into the custody of another for transportation: see in the case
of goods, Southcote’s Case, (1601) 4 Rep. 83 b. cited in Coggs <em>v.</em> Bernard, 1 Smith,
L. C., 11th ed., p. 173, and the notes thereto. In the case of persons received for
carriage, <span class='sc'>Parke, B.</span>, says in Lygo <em>v.</em> Newbold, (1854) 9 Ex. 302, at p. 305: ‘A person
who undertakes to provide for the conveyance of another, although he does so
gratuitously, is bound to exercise due and reasonable care.’ In Austin <em>v.</em> Great
Western Ry. Co., [1867] 2 Q. B. 442, at p. 445, <span class='sc'>Blackburn, J.</span>, says: ‘I think that
what was said in the case of Marshall <em>v.</em> York, Newcastle and Berwick Ry. Co.,
(1851) 11 C. B. 655, was quite correct. It was there laid down that the right
which a passenger by railway has to be carried safely does not depend on his having
made a contract, but that the fact of his being a passenger casts a duty on the
company to carry him safely.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Cox <em>v.</em> Coulson, [1916] 2 K. B. 177, a spectator in a theatre was injured by
the discharge of a pistol during a performance. Bankes, L. J., said: “It seems to
me obvious that the duty of the invitor in a case like the present is not only confined
to the state of the premises, using that expression as extending to the structure
merely. The duty must to some extent extend to the performance given in the
structure, because the performance may be of such a kind as to render the structure
an unsafe place to be in whilst the performance is going on, or it may be of such a
kind as to render the structure unsafe unless some obvious precaution is taken. As
an illustration under the latter head I would instance a case where a tight-rope
dancer performs on a rope stretched over the heads of the audience. In such a case
the provision of a net under the rope to protect the audience in case the performer
fell seems so obvious a precaution to take that in the absence of it the premises
could not be said to be reasonably safe. In the present case the performance was
one which included a discharge of pistols loaded with blank ammunition as one of
the incidents. If the pistols had been properly loaded, it is difficult to see that the
incident exposed any member of the audience in any ordinarily constructed theatre
to any danger. On the other hand, if any one of the pistols was not properly
loaded, what would otherwise be a safe performance became an exceedingly dangerous
one, and any part of the auditorium might be rendered an extremely unsafe
place to be in. Whether the circumstances were such that any negligence or want
of proper care can be attributed to the appellant in relation to the loading of the
pistol or in relation to the ammunition supplied for that purpose has not been
investigated, and I do not think that justice can be done between the parties until
this is done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Start, J., in LaFlam <em>v.</em> Missisquoi Pulp Company, 74 Vt. 125. 143: “The defendants,
by their second request, asked for an instruction that if, by the exercise
of ordinary care and prudence upon the part of the plaintiff, he would not have
been injured, he cannot recover. The court instructed the jury, that, if the plaintiff’s
want of ordinary care or his negligence contributed in any material degree to
the happening of the accident, he is not entitled to recover, even though the defendants
were negligent. This was in accordance with the rule as it has sometimes
been stated by this court. In Magoon <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Maine R. R. Co., 67 Vt. 184,
31 Atl. 156, and in Hill <em>v.</em> New Haven, 37 Vt. 507, 88 Am. Dec. 613, it is said that,
if the negligence or carelessness of the person injured contributes in any material
degree to the production of the injury complained of, he cannot recover; but in
Reynolds <em>v.</em> Boston &amp; Maine R. R. Co., 64 Vt. 66, 24 Atl. 134, 33 Am. St. Rep. 908,
the holding is that, if the negligence of the plaintiff contributes in the <em>least</em> degree
to the accident, there can be no recovery. We think this is the correct rule, and
that the instruction should have conformed to it. The use of the word ‘material’
left the jury at liberty to consider the degree of the plaintiff’s negligence, which is
not considered permissible in jurisdictions where the doctrine of contributory
negligence prevails. To allow jurors to consider so-called degrees of negligence
would, in effect, nullify this doctrine. 7 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, (2d ed.) 379.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“While purporting to give a legal definition of contributory negligence, this instruction

<p class='c007'>“... if it appears that his [plaintiff’s] negligence has contributed as an efficient
cause to the injury of which he complains, the court will not undertake to balance
the negligence of the respective parties for the purpose of determining which was
most at fault. The law recognizes no gradations of fault in such case, and where
both parties have been guilty of negligence, as a general rule, there can be no recovery.

in the defendant, except that the negligence of the former is called ‘contributory

<p class='c007'>“... there was a lack of ordinary care on his [the deceased’s] part, and where

<p class='c007'><a href='#r182'>182</a>. “The doctrine of comparative negligence no longer exists in this state.”
Wilkin, J., in City <em>v.</em> Holcomb, 205 Ill. 643, 646.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The intrinsic difficulty of the subject of contributory negligence has led to
three distinct lines of decisions. In England and a majority of the States of the
Union, the negligence of the plaintiff which contributes to the injury is held to be
an absolute bar to the action. In the States of Illinois and Georgia the doctrine of
comparative negligence has been adopted, that is, if on comparing the negligence
of the plaintiff with that of the defendant, the former is found to be slight and the
latter gross, the plaintiff may recover. In this State we hold that although the
injured party may contribute to the injury by his own carelessness or wrongful
conduct, yet if the act or negligence of the party inflicting the injury was the proximate
cause of the injury, the latter will be liable in damages, the negligence or
wrongful conduct of the party injured being taken into consideration, by way of
mitigation, in estimating the damages. In other words, if defendant was guilty of
a wrong by which plaintiff is injured, and plaintiff was also in some degree negligent
or contributed to the injury, it should go in mitigation of damages, but cannot
justify or excuse the wrong. East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia Railroad Company
<em>v.</em> Fain, 12 Lea, 35. At the same time we hold that if a party by his own
gross negligence bring an injury upon himself, or proximately contribute to such
injury, he cannot recover; neither can he recover in cases of mutual negligence
where both parties are equally blamable. Id. The principal difference between
our rule and the English rule, as modified by the more recent decisions, is in allowing
the damages to be mitigated by the conduct of the injured party. In this respect
our rule meets the objection which Mr. Thompson, in his notes on contributory
negligence, makes to the construction put by some of the courts on the English
rule, or to the application of the rule in particular cases. ‘It is,’ he says, ‘nothing
more than a declaration that although both parties have been guilty of negligence
contributing to the injury, the party who suffered the damage is to be completely
exonerated, and the other party is not to be exonerated to any extent; the former
is to recover of the latter without any abatement on account of his own share of the
fault, all the damages which he has suffered.’ ‘This is,’ he adds, ‘manifest injustice;
and yet it is practiced every day in the courts of England and in those of
nearly every State in the Union.’ 2 Thompson on Neg. 1155. Our rule, moreover,
is merely an adaptation of the law which prevails in civil actions for assault and
battery, where the conduct of the plaintiff in the way of provocation is always
admissible in evidence to mitigate the damages. Jackaway <em>v.</em> Dula, 7 Yer. 82;
Chambers <em>v.</em> Porter, 5 Cold. 273, 280; Suth. on Dam. 745.” Cooper, J., in Louisville

not because the child is guilty of contributory negligence, but because you are not
guilty of negligence. If it is an unavoidable accident, you are not responsible. If
the jury believe from the evidence in this case that the child suddenly and unexpectedly
appeared in the vicinity of the track under such circumstances that the
driver of the car could not have discovered its presence in time to avoid the accident,

<p class='c007'>“Let us view this subject in a more concrete form. The last railroad statistics
I have been able to find were issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission for
the year 1906.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The learned judge then copies a table from the report referred to and proceeds.]</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be observed that while the road mileage and train mileage in Canada are
each ten per cent of the entire road system and the entire train mileage, the number
of trespassers injured or killed in that country was only three per cent of the total
number; while in this State the road mileage is twenty-six per cent of the total
road mileage and the train mileage twenty-five per cent of the total train mileage,
forty-eight per cent of the total number of trespassers injured or killed were injured
or killed in Missouri.</p>

<p class='c007'>Illinois has thirty per cent of the road mileage and thirty-two per cent of the
train mileage, and only twenty per cent of the total number of trespassers injured
or killed were injured or killed in that State.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is important to know both the train mileage and the road mileage, for the reason
the greater number of trains that are run over a given road mileage the greater
number of fatalities to trespassers will result. The train mileage, therefore, in the
various States offers the most accurate basis for comparison.</p>

<p class='c007'>A computation will show that one trespasser was killed for every eighty-one
miles of road in Canada; for every seventeen miles in Michigan; for every forty-two
miles in Ohio; for every thirty-one miles in Indiana; for every forty-six miles
in Illinois; for every seventeen miles in Missouri; and for every forty-one miles in
Iowa.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be observed that the number of miles for each trespasser killed in Missouri
and Michigan is the same. This results, however, from the fact that the line
from Chicago, St. Louis, and other points converging at Montpelier, Ohio, and
thence all the traffic eastward goes over the one hundred and five miles of line
located in the State of Michigan. The effect of this is also shown in the train mileage.
Thus, while Michigan has only four per cent of road mileage, it has one-third
or six per cent of the train mileage. The population along the Michigan
mileage is very dense; about five miles of the line from Delray to Detroit run
through a very densely populated district—practically a city.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should also be noted that while Illinois has greater road and train mileage
than Missouri, only sixteen trespassers were injured or killed while walking on
tracks in that State, where thirty-nine persons were killed or injured while walking
on the track in Missouri. If we also consider the more dense population of Illinois,
the figures become more startling. And if we should extend these figures in the
same proportion to all of the railroads of the State and country, we would then see
the appalling number of trespassers killed and injured annually on account of this
inhuman doctrine, which is approximately 7750.</p>

<p class='c007'>In so far as I have been able to ascertain, the courts of all the other States than
this hold that persons who walk upon railroad tracks do so at their peril, and I am
thoroughly satisfied and convinced that this fact accounts for the small number of
fatalities to track-walkers in those States as compared with Missouri; and by
parity of reasoning I am also convinced that if said section 1105 was strictly enforced,
as it should be, the contrast between those States and this would not be
near so great as it is now; and that if we had a statute like that of Canada, making
it a crime for persons to walk upon railroad tracks, then the percentage of fatalities
to track-walkers in this State would fall still lower than what it is in any of the
States mentioned. Such a policy and such a statute would exclude from the railroads
all pedestrians, and thereby save this great sacrifice of life and limb, as well
as the pecuniary loss incident thereto.” <span class='sc'>Woodson, J.</span> (dissenting), in Murphy <em>v.</em>

<p class='c007'>“Mere negligence which gives a cause of action is the doing of an act, or the
omission to act, which results in damage, but without intent to do wrong or cause
damage. To constitute a wilful injury, there must be design, purpose, intent to do
wrong and inflict the injury. Then there is that reckless indifference or disregard
of the natural or probable consequence of doing an act, or omission of an act, designated whether accurately or not, in our decisions, as ‘wanton negligence,’ to which
is imputed the same degree of culpability and held to be equivalent to wilful injury.
A purpose or intent to injure is not an ingredient of wanton negligence. Where
either of those exist, if damage ensues, the injury is wilful. In wanton negligence,
the party doing the act, or failing to act, is conscious of his conduct, and without
having the intent to injure, is conscious, from his knowledge of existing circumstances
and conditions, that his conduct will likely or probably result in injury.
These are the distinctions between simple negligence, wilful injury, and that wanton
negligence which is the equivalent of wilful injury, drawn and applied in our
decisions. A mere error of judgment as to the result of doing an act or the omission
of an act, having no evil purpose or intent, or consciousness of probable injury,
may constitute simple negligence, but cannot rise to the degree of wanton negligence
or wilful wrong....” Coleman, J., in Birmingham R. Co. <em>v.</em> Bowers, 110
Ala. 328, 331.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The mere intentional omission to perform a duty or the intentional doing of an
act contrary to duty, although such conduct be culpable and result in injury, without
further averment, falls very far short of showing that the injury was intentionally
or wantonly inflicted. Unless there was a purpose to inflict the injury, it
cannot be said to have been intentionally done; and unless an act is done, or
omitted to be done, under circumstances and conditions known to the person, that
his conduct is likely to, or probably will result in injury, and through reckless indifference
to consequences, he consciously and intentionally does a wrongful act, or
omits an act, the injury cannot be said to be wantonly inflicted. These principles
have been frequently declared by this court....” Coleman, J., in Memphis R.

<p class='c007'>“For a motorman to be inattentive to the way ahead of him is so palpably negligent
that it partakes of the nature of a reckless and wanton act. Therefore a defendant
in an action of this character will not be heard to say that its motorman
did not see the situation of the injured person where it was open to his view nor did
not realize the peril where the indications would have disclosed it to any reasonable
mind. Charged with the knowledge of the peril of another that could have been
obtained by the use of ordinary care, a failure on the part of a motorman to make
every reasonable effort to avoid injuring the endangered person would be in the
highest degree wrongful, since it would be negligence committed with the knowledge that another certainly and immediately would be injured thereby. The principles
of right and justice do not tolerate the idea that the negligence of the person
imperilled involved in his act of placing himself in position to be injured without
giving proper heed to his own safety can coöperate with the negligence of one who
comprehending his danger or being in a position to comprehend it by the use of
ordinary care and having at hand the means and opportunity of avoiding it, fails
to reasonably employ them and by such failure inflicts an injury. Such negligence
engrosses the entire field of culpability and eliminates contributory negligence as a
factor in the production of the injury. It logically follows from the principles
stated that the issue of negligence in the performance of the humanitarian duty
must be governed by the rules applicable to ordinary negligence. The determinative
question in all such cases is, did the operators of the car use ordinary care to
ascertain the peril of the plaintiff and to avoid the injury after they discovered it or
should have discovered it? In some of the decisions of the Supreme Court the
idea appears to be expressed that in order to find a defendant guilty of a breach of
the humanitarian rule the elements of wantonness and wilfulness must appear in
its conduct, but as we have attempted to show the mere failure to observe ordinary
care in situations of this character is of itself a wanton act since it is abhorrent not
only to fundamental principles of law but to the dictates of common humanity.
The views expressed are supported by the weight of authority in this state, including
the most recent decisions of the Supreme and Appellate courts....” Johnson,
J., in Cole <em>v.</em> Metropolitan R. Co., 121 Mo. App. 605, 611.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Leroy Fibre Co. <em>v.</em> Chicago R. Co., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, Holmes, J., (concurring in the
result) said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If a man stacked his flax so near to a railroad that it obviously was likely to be
set fire to by a well-managed train, I should say that he could not throw the loss
upon the road by the oscillating result of an inquiry by the jury whether the road
had used due care. I should say that although of course he had a right to put his
flax where he liked upon his own land the liability of the railroad for a fire was
absolutely conditioned upon the stacks being at a reasonably safe distance from
the train. I take it that probably many, certainly some, rules of law based on less
than universal considerations are made absolute and universal in order to limit
those over-refined speculations that we all deprecate, especially where such rules
are based upon or affect the continuous physical relations of material things. The
right that is given to inflict various inconveniences upon neighboring lands by
building or digging, is given, I presume, because of the public interest in making
improvement free, yet it generally is made absolute by the common law. It is not
thought worth while to let the right to build or maintain a barn depend upon the
speculations of a jury as to motives. A defect in the highway, declared a defect in
the interest of the least competent travellers that can travel unattended without
taking legal risks, or in the interest of the average man, I suppose to be a defect as
to all. And as in this case the distinction between the inevitable and the negligent
escape of sparks is one of the most refined in the world, I think that I must be
right so far, as to the law in the case supposed.</p>

<p class='c007'>If I am right so far, a very important element in determining the right to recover
is whether the plaintiff’s flax was so near to the track as to be in danger from even a
prudently managed engine. Here certainly, except in a clear case, we should call
in the jury. I do not suppose that any one would call it prudent to stack flax
within five feet of the engines or imprudent to do it at a distance of half a mile, and
it would not be absurd if the law ultimately should formulate an exact measure,
as it has tended to in other instances; (Martin <em>v.</em> District of Columbia, 205 U. S.
135, 139) but at present I take it that if the question I suggest be material we should
let the jury decide whether seventy feet was too near by the criterion that I have
proposed. Therefore, while the majority answer the first question, No, on the
ground that the railroad is liable upon the facts stated as matter of law, I should
answer it Yes, with the proviso that it was to be answered No, in case the jury
found that the flax, although near, was not near enough to the trains to endanger
it if the engines were prudently managed, or else I should decline to answer the
question because it fails to state the distance of the stacks.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not think we need trouble ourselves with the thought that my view depends
upon differences of degree. The whole law does so as soon as it is civilized. See
Nash <em>v.</em> United States, 229 U. S. 373, 376, 377. Negligence is all degree—that of
the defendant here degree of the nicest sort; and between the variations according
to distance that I suppose to exist and the simple universality of the rules in the
Twelve Tables or the Leges Barbarorum, there lies the culture of two thousand
years.”</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f239'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r239'>239</a>. At common law, no civil action could be maintained for wrongfully causing the
death of a human being. Following the English act of 1846, known as Lord Campbell’s
Act (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. 93) statutes in all jurisdictions now provide an action
for the benefit of specified relatives of a deceased person against one who tortiously
caused his death. In Tiffany, Death by Wrongful Act, 2 Edition, 1913, these statutes
are printed in full in the appendix. The book also contains an analytical table
of the statutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes the relatives are authorized to sue in person; while in other statutes
it is provided that the action shall be brought by an administrator of the estate of
the deceased. But, even under the latter class of statutes, the sum recovered does
not usually become a part of the general assets of the estate available for the payment
of creditors (unless, perhaps, in the absence of any relatives). In some instances
the statute provides that an action can be brought only in case the person
killed could have maintained an action if death had not ensued. But, even where
the statute does not contain an explicit provision of the above nature, the courts
generally hold that contributory negligence on the part of the deceased bars the
statutory action. The question remains: Will the contributory negligence of the
sole beneficiary bar the action, either where he is personally plaintiff, or where he is
plaintiff in his capacity as administrator of the deceased, or where the plaintiff is a
third person suing in the capacity of administrator?</p>

<p class='c007'>The statutes of a few states may, perhaps, be construed as proceeding upon the
theory that a right of action is vested in the deceased, and that provision is now
made for the survival of such right of action.</p>

or liable to the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 3731.... When a wrongful act produces death, the damages shall be
disposed of as personal property belonging to the estate of the deceased, except
that if the deceased leaves a husband, wife, child, or parent, it shall not be liable
for the payment of debts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 3732. The actions contemplated in the two preceding sections may be
brought, or the court, on motion, may allow the action to be continued, by or
against the legal representatives or successors in interest of the deceased. Such
action shall be deemed a continuing one, and to have accrued to such representative
or successor at the same time it did to the deceased if he had survived....</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 3761. A father, or, in case of his death or imprisonment or desertion of

would seem to be no reason why it would not bar him from recovering any property

<p class='c007'>“The right of recovery and measure of damages are different from what existed
in the intestate. This right of recovery did not exist at common law. It is wholly
given by the act. It is not an act to cause to survive a right of recovery which
otherwise would be taken away by the death of the injured.... Hence the contention
that the recovery is in the right of the intestate, and can be defeated only
by his contributory negligence, cannot be sustained.... From a very early day
the common law has denied a recovery, as unjust, to a party whose negligence has
contributed to the accident causing the injury for which he demands damages. All
statutes conferring a right of recovery of damages, especially when in terms they
give such damages only as are <em>just</em>, must be read and considered with reference to

<p class='c007'>In Johnson <em>v.</em> Town of Irasburgh, 47 Vt. 28, the Supreme Court of Vermont,
while agreeing with the reasoning in Sutton <em>v.</em> Wauwatosa, on the question of causation, nevertheless reached the same result as in Bosworth <em>v.</em> Swansey, holding that
the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. This conclusion was arrived at upon
grounds which were not discussed in the above Wisconsin and Massachusetts cases.
The very able opinion of Ross, J., upon this point (47 Vt. 35–38), may be summarized
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The liability of the town for the insufficiency of the highway is purely statutory.
The duty to travellers imposed by the statute is only a duty to that class of travellers
who have the right to pass, to those who are legally travelling. The legislature
did not intend to impose a duty upon towns “in behalf of a person who was forbidden
to use all highways for the purposes of travel, and at a time when he was so
forbidden to use them. Can he be a traveller within the purview of the statute who
is forbidden to travel?” The duty and liability “are co-extensive with the purposes
for which persons can legitimately use the highways, and no greater.” “The
plaintiff when injured was forbidden by law to use the highway, and by reason
thereof the defendant town owed him no duty to provide any kind of a highway,
and therefore was under no liability for any insufficiency in any highway.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Bourne <em>v.</em> Whitman, 209 Mass. 155, a duly licensed automobile was being
driven by an unlicensed person. Knowlton, C. J., said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is universally recognized that the violation of a criminal statute is evidence
of negligence on the part of the violator, as to all consequences that the statute was
intended to prevent. It has been said in a general way that such a violation is
<a id='n401'></a>evidence of negligence of the violator, and it has sometimes been stated that this
would show negligence that can be availed of as a ground of recovery by one who
suffers any kind of an injury from him while this illegality continues; but it is now
settled that it is not even evidence of negligence, except in reference to matters to
which the statute relates. Davis <em>v.</em> John L. Whiting &amp; Son Co., 201 Mass. 91, 96
and cases cited. A criminal statute in the usual form is enacted for the benefit of
the public. It creates a duty to the public. Every member of the public is covered
by the protecting influence of the obligation. If one suffers injury as an individual,
in his person or his property, by a neglect of this duty, he has a remedy, not because
our general criminal laws are divided in their operation, creating one duty to
the public and a separate duty to individuals; but because as one of the public in
a peculiar situation, he suffers a special injury, different in kind from that of the
public generally, from the neglect of the public duty....</p>

<p class='c007'>If we consider the effect of such a violation of law by a plaintiff, upon his right
to recover, the principles that have been recognized are instructive. They were
considered long ago in connection with our Sunday law. It has been established
from early times that one who is violating a criminal law cannot recover for an
injury to which his criminality was a directly contributing cause....</p>

<p class='c007'>The only matter which seems to be left doubtful under our decisions in this class
of cases, is what constitutes ‘illegality,’ which is sometimes a directly contributing
cause of the injury. Some cases have been decided, which seem to imply that if
there is an illegal element entering into a plaintiff’s act or conduct, and this act or
conduct directly contributes to his injury, he cannot recover, although the illegal
element or the objectionable quality of the act had no tendency to produce the injury,
and the consequences would have been the same under the other existing conditions,
if the criminal element had been absent. In other cases the decision seems
to turn upon whether the criminal element in the act or conduct, considered by itself
alone, operated as a direct cause to produce a result that would not have been
produced under the same conditions in other respects, if the criminal element had
been absent. This latter seems to be the pivotal question in most cases decided in
other States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact that the number of punishable misdemeanors has multiplied many
times in recent years, as the relations of men in business and society have grown
complex with the increase of population, is a reason why the violation of a criminal
statute of slight importance should not affect one’s civil rights, except when this
violation, viewed in reference to the element of criminality intended to be punished,
has had a direct effect upon his cause of action. Our decisions seem to have
been tending toward the adoption of such a rule. Welch <em>v.</em> Wesson, 6 Gray, 505.

<p class='c007'>Under particular statutes, we are brought back to the question, what is the legal
element which is the essence of the command or prohibition? In most cases, the
effect of doing or failing to do that which the law forbids or requires under a
penalty, when considered in reference to its relation to one’s civil rights in collateral
matters, ought to be limited pretty strictly. Take the case of driving without
sleigh bells in violation of the law of the road. R. L., c. 54, § 3. Kidder <em>v.</em> Dunstable,
11 Gray, 342. Counter <em>v.</em> Couch, 8 Allen, 436, 437. The requirement of
the law is that ‘No person shall travel on a bridge or way with a sleigh or sled
drawn by a horse, unless there are at least three bells attached to some part of the
harness.’ The wrong to be prevented is the failure to have bells while travelling in
this way. The travelling in other respects is unobjectionable. The question
arises whether the act should be deemed illegal as a whole, in reference to the rule
that the courts will not aid one to obtain the fruits of his disobedience of law, or
whether in this aspect its different qualities may be considered separately. It is
possible to decide this question either way, but we think it is more consistent with
justice and with the course of decision elsewhere, to hold that, in reference to the
law of negligence and the rule as to rejection of causes of action that are founded
on illegality, an act may be considered in its different aspects in its relation to the
cause of action, and if only that part of it which is innocent affects the cause of
action, the existence of an illegal element is immaterial. We do not think, under
this statute, that one who drives in a sleigh without bells should be treated as a
<a id='n402'></a>trespasser on the highway, although he is punishable criminally for the failure to
have the bells attached to the harness, and is liable in damages to any member of
the public who suffers a special injury by reason of this failure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Consider the St. 1909, c. 514, § 74, which forbids, under a penalty, the regular
operation of any elevator by a person under the age of sixteen years, and the regular
operation of any rapidly running elevator by a person under the age of eighteen
years. If a person under the prescribed age, while employed to operate an elevator,
is injured through the negligence of the owner, in leaving it in an unsafe condition,
shall his violation of the statute by entering this service before reaching the prescribed
age, be treated as criminality, entering into every one of his acts in moving
the elevator, so as to prevent his recovery for an injury from the joint effect of his
employer’s negligence and his own application of the power to raise or lower the
elevator? We think it better to hold, if his age and the degree of his competency,
which might depend in part upon his age, had no causal connection with the injury,
that his criminality was not a direct cause of the injury. In other words, that the
punishable element in the act is only disobedience as to age, and although his act in
applying the power to the elevator which brought him in contact with the defect,
is punishable, and in a sense illegal because of the existence of that element, in
determining the relation of his conduct to the cause of action, to see whether the
court will aid him in the prosecution of it, we ought to limit the illegality to that
part of his conduct towards which the statute is particularly directed. We are to
consider the specific thing at which the statute is aimed, and the immediate effect
that it was intended directly and proximately to accomplish by its command or
prohibition....</p>

<p class='c007'>Take the provision in St. 1903, c. 473, § 5, that ‘No person shall operate an
automobile or motor cycle for hire, unless specially licensed by the commission so
to do,’ and the earlier provision in the same section that no person shall ‘operate
an automobile or motor cycle upon any public highway or private way laid out
under authority of statute unless licensed so to do under the provisions of this act.’
The operating of the automobile in itself is unobjectionable. The illegal element in
the act is the failure to have a license. The purpose of the requirement of a license
is to secure competency in the operator. If in any case the failure to have a
license, looking to those conditions that ordinarily accompany the failure to have
it, is a cause contributing directly to an injury, a violator of the law would be
legally responsible to another person injured by the failure; or, if he is injured
himself, would be precluded from recovery against another person who negligently
contributed to the injury. But we are of opinion that his failure in that respect is
only evidence of negligence in reference to his fitness to operate a car, and to his
skill in the actual management of it, unless in the case of the plaintiff, it is shown
to be a contributing cause to the injury sued for, in which case it is a bar to recovery.
We think that the operation of a car without a license, while it is a punishable
act, does not render the operator a trespasser on the highway, but that the
illegal element in the act is only the failure to have a license while operating it, so
that if the operation and movement contributed to the accident with which the
want of a license had no connection, except as a mere condition, they would not
preclude the operator as a plaintiff from recovery. If the illegal quality of the act
had no tendency to cause the accident, the fact that the act is punishable because
of the illegality, ought not to preclude one from recovery for harmful results to
which, without negligence, the innocent features of the act alone contributed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other part of this statute, relative to the licensing of automobiles, has been
construed differently. In Dudley <em>v.</em> Northampton Street Railway, 202 Mass. 443,
because of the peculiar provisions of the statute and the dangers and evils that it
was intended to prevent, it was decided, after much consideration, that the having
of such a machine in operation on a street, without a license, was the very essence
of the illegality, and that the illegality was inseparable from the movement of the
automobile upon the street at any time, for a single foot; that in such movement
the machine was an outlaw, and any person on the street as an occupant of the
automobile, participating in the movement of it, was for the time being a trespasser.
Some of us were disinclined to lay down the law so broadly, and the opinion
of the court was not unanimous; but the doctrine has been repeatedly reaffirmed
and is now the established law of the Commonwealth. Feeley <em>v.</em> Melrose, 205
Mass. 329. Chase <em>v.</em> New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, 208 Mass. 137,
158. The difference between this provision of the statute and that involved in the
present case is in part one of form, but in connection with the form, it is still more
the seeming purpose and intent of the Legislature as to permitting such machines
upon the public ways without adequate means of identifying them and ascertaining
their owner, together with the requirement that the machine itself, as a
thing of power, shall have its own registration and legalization, the evidence of
which it shall always carry with it....</p>

<p class='c007'>We are of opinion that the law of these last cases should not be extended to the
provision of the statute requiring every operator to have a personal license to
operate the car. The jury should have been instructed that the defendant’s failure
to have a license was only evidence of his negligence as to the management of the
car.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Taylor <em>v.</em> Stewart, 172 N. C. 203, Brown, J., (for the court) said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The plaintiff sues to recover for the death of his child, who was run over and
killed by an automobile, belonging to the defendant J. W. Stewart. At the time the
car was being operated by James Stewart, the son of the said J. W. Stewart, a lad
of 13 years of age. A colored chauffeur, who had been sent out with the car by
the owner, was sitting beside the lad.</p>

<p class='c007'>His honor charged the jury that under the laws of North Carolina it was a misdemeanor
for a person under the age of 16 to drive an automobile upon any highway
or public street, and that it is a circumstance from which the jury may infer
negligence, and that it does not necessarily follow that the jury shall conclude it
was negligence, but that it is a circumstance to go to the jury. In this his honor
erred. He should have instructed the jury that it is negligence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i> for the defendant
James Stewart to have driven the machine in violation of the statute law
of the state. Zageir <em>v.</em> Southern Express Co., 89 S. E. 44; Paul <em>v.</em> Railroad, 170

<p class='c007'>“There are expressions in some of the cases indicating that the liability of the
owner is not affected by the negligence of the person injured.... If a person with
full knowledge of the evil propensities of an animal wantonly excites him or voluntarily
and unnecessarily puts himself in the way of such an animal, he would be
adjudged to have brought the injury upon himself, and ought not to be entitled to
recover. In such a case it cannot be said, in a legal sense, that the keeping of the
animal, which is the <em>gravamen</em> of the offence, produced the injury.... But as the
owner is held to a rigorous rule of liability on account of the danger to human life
and limb, by harboring and keeping such animals, it follows that he ought not to
be relieved from it by slight negligence or want of ordinary care [on the part of the
plaintiff].... As negligence, in the ordinary sense, is not the ground of liability,
so contributory negligence, in its ordinary meaning, is not a defence. These terms
are not used in a strictly legal sense in this class of actions, but for convenience&#160;... I think&#160;... that the rule of liability before indicated is a reasonable one,
and that the owner cannot be relieved from it by any act of the person injured, unless
it be one from which it can be affirmed that he caused the injury himself, with
a full knowledge of its probable consequences.” <em>Church, C. J.</em>, in Muller <em>v.</em>

<p class='c007'>“This was a case of the escape of water from lavatory pipes. It would appear,
therefore, that the construction of distributing water-pipes in a building is an

<p class='c007'>See the remarks of Doe, C. J., in Brown <em>v.</em> Collins, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">infra</span></i>, p. 482.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This rule is rightly applicable only to such unusual and extraordinary uses of
property in reference to the benefits to be derived from the use and the dangers or
losses to which others are exposed, as should not be permitted except at the sole
risk of the user. The standard of duty established by the courts in these cases is
that every owner shall refrain from these unwarrantable and extremely dangerous
uses of property unless he provides safeguards whose perfection he guarantees....
The principle applicable to the erection of common buildings whose fall might do
damage to persons or property on the adjacent premises holds owners to a less
strict duty. This principle is that where a certain lawful use of property will
bring to pass wrongful consequences from the condition in which the property is
put, if these are not guarded against, an owner who makes such a use is bound at
his peril to see that proper care is taken in every particular to prevent the wrong....
The duty which the law imposes upon an owner of real estate in such a
case, is to make the conditions safe so far as it can be done by the exercise of
ordinary care on the part of all those engaged in the work. He is responsible for
the negligence of independent contractors as well as for that of his servants. This
rule is applicable to every one who builds an ordinary wall which is liable to do
serious injury by falling outside of his own premises.... The uses of property
governed by this rule are those that bring new conditions which involve risks to
the persons or property of others, but which are ordinary and usual and in a sense
natural, as incident to the ownership of the land. The rule first referred to applies
to unusual and extraordinary uses which are so fraught with peril to others that
the owner should not be permitted to adopt them for his own purposes without
absolutely protecting his neighbors from injury or loss by reason of the use.”

<p class='c007'>“In every case of the kind which has been reported since Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher,
that is, during the last 25 years, there has been a manifest inclination to discover
something in the facts which took the case out of the rule. According to the English
judicial system which has gone round the world with the English language and
English or Anglicized institutions, the decisions of superior courts are not merely
instructive and worthy of regard, but of binding authority in subsequent cases of
the like sort. But there are some authorities which are followed and developed in
the spirit, which become the starting-point of new chapters of the law; there are
others that are followed only in the letter, and become slowly but surely choked
and crippled by exceptions. This again, is independent of the considerations of
local fitness which must always have weight when precedents are cited from a
country remote both in place and in manners.” Pollock, Law of Fraud in British
India, 53–54 (1894).</p>

<p class='c007'>“In August, 1908, Count Z. sent one of his dirigibles from Mainz to Friederickshafen.
Some motor trouble happened, and the ship was landed in a field. Thousands
of people rushed to the place, so ropes were run around it, and soldiers were
ordered on guard. The ship was anchored, and in addition held by forty men with
ropes at the stem, and by thirty at the stern. In the afternoon a sudden thunderstorm
came up, struck the dirigible, tore it loose and sent it adrift for about a
mile, when it caught fire and was destroyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spectators had been around all the time, and were standing outside the ropes
in rows several deep. Some unfortunate person standing in the outer row near
<a id='n467'></a>the rear gondola, was caught by the ship’s anchor, dragged into the air and carried
for some distance; in the fall, one of his legs sustained such injuries that it
had to be amputated.</p>

<p class='c007'>He brought suit for damages, and was nonsuited; appealed; same result.
Finally, he appealed to the Reichsgericht. It refused to interfere, for the following
reasons: There being no special law governing damage by air-navigation, it becomes
necessary to prove negligence on the part of the aviator or promoter. The
idea that the mere undertaking of a business, acknowledged to be dangerous,
carries with it responsibility for all damage caused thereby, is not law. The only
duty which the hazardousness of the undertaking imposes upon the person engaged
therein, is that of extra care. Otherwise, almost all kinds of transportation
would be impossible.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this case, the trip had commenced during exceptionally fine weather, which
continued until after the time when the ship had been landed and anchored.
Defendant had proved that on former occasions he had succeeded in landing,
anchoring and holding his ship, even when the weather was unfavorable, and that
the means he on such occasions had employed in keeping the ship at its moorings,
were not any stronger than those employed on this occasion; in fact, they were
weaker. It could not be demanded of the defendant that he should anticipate and
provide against such an extraordinary violent gust of wind as tore his airship
away.” 75 Central Law Journ. 311 (1912).</p>

<p class='c007'>In Charing Cross Co. <em>v.</em> London Hydraulic Power Co., [1914] 3 K. B. 772, hydraulic
mains under the streets burst and injured plaintiff’s cables, also laid in the
streets. Lord Sumner said (pp. 779–780): “I think that this present case is also
indistinguishable from Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher. Two grounds of distinction have been
suggested. It is said that the doctrine of Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher is applicable between
the owners of adjacent closes, which are adjacent whether there be any intermediate
property or not; and that it is a doctrine depending upon the ownership of
land and the rights attaching to the ownership of land, under which violations
of that species of right can be prevented or punished. In the present case instead
of having two adjacent owners of real property, you have only two neighboring
owners, not strictly adjacent, of chattels, whose chattels are there under a permission
which might have been obtained by the private license of the owners of the
soil, though in fact obtained under parliamentary powers; hence the two companies
are in the position of co-users of a highway, or at any rate of co-users of
different rooms in one house, and Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher does not apply. The case
depends on doctrines applicable to the highways, or to houses let out in tenements.
I am unable to agree with any of these distinctions, though they have been pressed
upon us by both learned counsel with great resource and command of the authorities.
Midwood <em>v.</em> Manchester Corporation, [1905] 2 K. B. 597, is not decided as a
case of a dispute arising between the owners of two adjacent closes. The case is
treated as one between a corporation, whose business under the roadway is exactly
similar to that of the defendant corporation here, and injured occupiers of the
premises. If the distinction drawn between the present case and that of adjacent
landowners in Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher be a good one, it either was not taken in Midwood
<em>v.</em> Manchester Corporation or was taken and treated as of no importance.
Further I am satisfied that Rylands <em>v.</em> Fletcher is not limited to the case of adjacent
freeholders. I shall not attempt to show how far it extends. It extends as
far as this case, and that is enough for the present purpose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Evers <em>v.</em> Davis, 86 N. J. Law, 196, 202, <span class='sc'>Garrison, J.</span>, says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The question then is, What is, upon common law principles, the effect of statutes
such as the one we are considering upon the action of negligence? The
familiar expressions that the breach of such a statute is ‘negligence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>’ or is
‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> evidence of negligence’ seem to me to postpone elucidation rather
than to contribute to it, while the implication that proof of a breach of a public
statute will support a private recovery is positively misleading.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fact constantly to be borne in mind in tracing the legal effect of such statutes
is that the negligence that is essential to the action of negligence is not solely in
the overt act that produced the injury complained of, but may lie in the failure to
foresee the danger likely to result from the doing of such act. ‘Danger, reasonably
to be foreseen at the time of acting, is the established test of negligence’ says the
writer already cited. Of negligence of this sort it may be said that it is common
to all phases of the action, which cannot be said of the mere overt act, which may
not be an act of neglect or omission at all, but, on the contrary, one of affirmative
commission, e. g., the blowing of a locomotive whistle (Bittle <em>v.</em> Camden and Atlantic
Railroad Co., 55 N. J. L. 615), the discharge of steam (Mumma <em>v.</em> Easton
and Amboy Railroad Co., 73 Id. 653) or the extraordinary lurching of a train
(Burr <em>v.</em> Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 64 Id. 30). But whether the overt act be
one of omission or of commission, and whether the conduct of the defendant be
stated in terms of ‘duty’ or of ‘fault,’ the one common denominator, so to speak,
of the action of negligence is this element of what we may call discoverable danger;
that is to say, a danger that is susceptible of being discovered in advance of action
or inaction by the exercise of that degree of care which if a man fails to exercise
he becomes civilly liable for the consequences of his conduct. Now, it is precisely
upon this element of discoverable danger that public statutes or ordinances act,
and they do this not by giving to the plaintiff a right of action he did not have
before, but by their operation upon what we may call the common law conscience
of the defendant, better known to us in its personified form of ‘the ordinary prudent
man,’ the familiar fiction designed by the common law to aid juries, when
deciding what was the proper thing for a man to do, to lose sight of the personal
point of view of that particular man and to base their judgment upon a general
standard which in the final assize is what the jury itself thinks was the proper
thing to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now this ordinary prudent man of common law creation must in the nature of
things be regarded as a law-abiding citizen to whom, as is pointed out by Dean
Thayer in the article referred to, it would be an unjust reproach to suppose that,
knowing the statute—for upon familiar principles he can claim no benefit from
his ignorance of it—he would break it, <em>reasonably</em> believing that it was a prudent
thing for him to do; and that in all probability no harm would come of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other words, it is inconsistent with ordinary prudence for an individual to
set up his private judgment against that of the lawfully constituted public authority.
We must assume, therefore, that the ordinary prudent man would not do such
a thing since to do so would be to change his entire nature and to forego the very
traits that brought him into existence. He would, in fine, cease to be the pattern
man he must continue to be in order to be at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon common law principles, therefore, when the legislature has by public
statute established a certain standard of conduct in order to prevent a danger that
it foresaw, it has in this regard forewarned the ‘ordinary prudent man’ and
through him the defendant in a civil action, whose conduct must always coincide
with this common law criterion. Such danger, therefore, does not have to be
proved by the plaintiff, since there is no longer room for a reasonable difference of
opinion, for by his breach of the statute the defendant, through his common law
conscience, is charged with knowledge that if injury ensues he will have acted at
his peril.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court therefore should so instruct the jury, whether such instruction be
couched in the terms of the defendant’s duty to perform or of his culpability for
neglect, or of his liability for the result of his action or inaction, as the case may
be; and thus upon common law principles the plaintiff in an action of negligence
obtains the benefit of the statute if he be one of the class for whose protection it
was enacted and the breach of such statute was the efficient cause of the injury of
which he complains.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Smith <em>v.</em> Mine &amp; Smelter Co., 32 Utah, 21, 30, <span class='sc'>Frick, J.</span>, says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The court instructed the jury in substance that, if they found from the evidence
that the appellant had violated the city ordinance in respect to keeping or
storing explosives, such violation constituted negligence per se. Counsel insist that
such is not the law; that it would be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> negligence at most. As to
whether a violation of a law or ordinance constitutes negligence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i> depends in
a large measure upon the nature of the law or ordinance. When a standard of duty
or care is fixed by law or ordinance, and such law or ordinance has reference to the
safety of life, limb, or property, then, as a matter of necessity, a violation of such
law or ordinance constitutes negligence. In any case the standard is usually defined
as that degree of care that men of ordinary care and prudence usually exercise.
But, when the standard is fixed by law or ordinance, how can one be heard
to say that he exercised care in exceeding, or in refraining to comply with, the
standard fixed? There is, in such cases, no comparison to be made. Care and
prudence alone cannot excuse. Exceeding or disregarding the standard of care
imposed must be held to be negligence, if it is anything. If it is held not to be
such <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, it simply amounts to this: That it is for the jury to say whether, in
violating a law or ordinance fixing a standard of care to be observed the law was
carefully or negligently violated. The violation, thus in and of itself, would mean
nothing, and one would be permitted to violate the law with impunity, provided
the jury find it to have been carefully done. Neither is it an answer to say that
the violation may have been caused by the act of God or unavoidable accident. If
such be the case, then the act constituted no violation in law, and when there is no
violation there would be no negligence arising out of such act or acts alone, and
the jury would be required to find whether the act or acts complained of constituted
a violation, as above indicated, or not. If they found that the law was
disregarded, but that it was occasioned by a higher power or through unavoidable
accident, then there would be no violation by the person charged, and hence no
negligence imputable to him from that act alone. But if they found that he had
violated the law by his own act, or by the acts of others chargeable to him, then
there would be negligence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. This negligence, however, standing alone, is not
civilly actionable. The negligence must in all cases be found to be the proximate
cause of the injury. The court instructed the jury that unless they found that the
negligence, if they found negligence as above stated, was the proximate cause of the
injury complained of, the respondent could not recover. This, we think, is a correct
statement of the law pertaining to ordinances such as the one in question here.
We do not hold that a violation of all laws or ordinances constitutes negligence
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, but we do hold that the violation of ordinances designed for the safety of
life, limb, or property, does constitute negligence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, and this, we think, is
supported by the clear weight of authority.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is sometimes said that violation of a duty so imposed is “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> evidence
of negligence;” Giles <em>v.</em> Diamond State Iron Co., 7 Houst. 453; True <em>v.</em> Woda,
104 Ill. App. 15; Wabash R. Co. <em>v.</em> Kamradt, 109 Ill. App. 203; Mize <em>v.</em> Rocky
Mountain Tel. Co., 38 Mont. 521; Briggs <em>v.</em> New York R. Co., 72 N. Y. 26; Acton
<em>v.</em> Reed, 104 App. Div. 507.</p>

<p class='c007'>A distinction between a statute and a municipal ordinance has been urged.
Philadelphia R. Co. <em>v.</em> Ervin, 89 Pa. St. 71; Lederman <em>v.</em> Pennsylvania R. Co., 165
Pa. St. 118; Riegert <em>v.</em> Thackery, 212 Pa. St. 86.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Ubelmann <em>v.</em> American Ice Co., 209 Pa. St. 398, 400, <span class='sc'>Brown, J.</span>, says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“When negligence is charged it must be proved. Proof of the violation of an
ordinance regulating or relating to conduct alleged to have been negligent is not in
itself conclusive proof of the negligence charged. The ordinance and its violation
are matters of evidence, to be considered with all other evidence in the case: Lane
<em>v.</em> Atlantic Works, 111 Mass. 136. But this rule is limited to cases in which the
ordinance relates to the alleged negligent act under investigation. Here, as stated,
it was the use of an alleged defective shifting rod in the elevator. Ordinances and
their violation are admissible, not as substantive and sufficient proof of the negligence
of the defendant, but as evidence of municipal expression of opinion, on a
matter as to which the municipal authorities had acted, that the defendant was
negligent, and are to be taken into consideration with all the other facts in the
case. Illustrations of this are found in several of our later cases. In Lederman <em>v.</em>
Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 165 Pa. 118, one of the questions was the undue rate of
speed at which the defendant company was running its cars through the city of
Lancaster, and we held that the ordinance in relation to the speed of railway trains
within the city limits had been properly admitted. An ordinance of the city of
Philadelphia requires all vehicles, including bicycles, to keep to the right, and, in
Foote <em>v.</em> American Product Co., 195 Pa. 190, where the rider of the bicycle had
conformed to this ordinance, and the driver of the wagon that ran into him had
not, we said, through our Brother Mestrezat: ‘While the ordinance in itself was
not evidence of negligence, it may be considered with other evidence in ascertaining
whether the defendant was guilty of negligence.’ When the suit is against the
municipality itself, and it is charged with negligence, due to the dereliction of its
employees, their violation or disregard of its own regulations and ordinances relating
to the matter under investigation are proof of such dereliction, though not
necessarily of the specific negligence charged, which, as in all other cases, must be
proved by proper and satisfactory evidence. The dereliction of the municipal employees
is to be taken into consideration with the other facts in the case, upon proof
of which the plaintiff relies to sustain his allegation of negligence. An illustration
of this is Herron <em>v.</em> The City of Pittsburg, 204 Pa. 509, which was an action against
the city to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by a boy from contact
with a live, naked telephone wire used in the police service of the city, and it
appeared that the break in the wire was known to the police officials within an
hour after it had occurred, and that it was also known to them to be in close
proximity to other wires, some of which carried strong and dangerous currents of
electricity. We regarded as proper the admission of the ordinance of the city and
the rules of the police department relating to the inspection and use of the city
wires.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ordinance of April 10, 1894, provides for the inspection of elevators by inspectors
duly appointed by the city of Philadelphia, and makes it the duty of the
owner or operator of an elevator, after its inspection, to procure from the inspector
a certificate that it is in condition to be operated, and to expose the certificate to
public view as near as possible to the elevator car. This ordinance does not make
it the duty of one owning or operating an elevator to demand an inspection, and it
is only after the inspector has inspected that he must procure and expose the certificate.
But, even if there had been an inspection here, and the defendant company
had not procured and exposed the proper certificate, its failure to do so is not
the negligence charged against it that resulted in the plaintiff’s injury, and the
ordinance clearly had no proper place in his evidence.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r307'>307</a>. In Cowley <em>v.</em> Newmarket Local Board, [1892] A. C. 345, 351, Lord Herschell
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My Lords, the question which arises in this action is whether the defendants
are liable in respect of an accident which happened to the plaintiff, owing to the
existence of a drop of eighteen inches in the level of a footway vested in the defendants,
in consequence of which the plaintiff fell and sustained considerable injury.
The difference of level in the footway arose from a carriage-way having
been made for the purpose of access to Captain Machell’s stable, the yard of which
adjoined the footway. This work was executed by Captain Machell in the year
1873. The plaintiff in his statement of claim asserted that the defendants had
wrongfully suffered and permitted the footway to be out of repair and in a condition
dangerous to passengers. It appeared clearly at the trial that there had been
no misfeasance on the part of the defendants. The utmost that could be charged
against them was nonfeasance. It was strongly urged at the bar that the highway
including the footway being vested in the defendants, they were responsible if it
was not kept in proper condition and repair to any one who was injured by reason
of its not being so kept. In support of their contention they relied mainly on the
144th and 149th sections of the Public Health Act, 1875. By the former of those
sections every urban authority is to execute the office of surveyor of highways, and
to exercise and be subject to all the powers, duties, and liabilities of surveyors.
By the latter it is provided that the urban sanitary authority shall from time to
time cause all streets vested in them to be levelled, paved, metalled, flagged, channelled,
altered, and repaired as occasion may require. Amongst the duties thus
imposed upon the urban authority was undoubtedly the duty of keeping this highway
in repair, and it is said that any person injured by the non-performance of a
statutory duty is entitled to recover against the person on whom that duty rests.
I entertain very grave doubts whether the proposition thus broadly stated can be
maintained. The principal authority in support of it is the decision of the Court
of Queen’s Bench in the case of Couch <em>v.</em> Steel, 3 E. &amp; B. 402. But in the case of
Atkinson <em>v.</em> Newcastle Waterworks Company, 2 Ex. D. 441, the late Lord Cairns
and Cockburn, C. J., and the present Master of the Rolls all expressed serious
doubts whether the case of Couch <em>v.</em> Steel was rightly decided, and whether the
broad general proposition could be supported, that whenever a statutory duty is
created any person who can show he has sustained injury from the non-performance
of that duty can maintain an action for damages against the person on whom
the duty is imposed. I share the doubt expressed by these learned judges and the
opinion expressed by Lord Cairns that much must ‘depend on the purview of the
Legislature in the particular statute and the language which they have there employed.’
In the case of Glossop <em>v.</em> Heston and Isleworth Local Board, 12 Ch. D.
102, 109, James, L. J., made some observations bearing on this point, which seem
to me to be of great weight. In that case the plaintiff claimed an injunction to
restrain a nuisance on the ground that the defendants had neglected to perform
the statutory duty cast on them as the sanitary authority of a particular district.
The learned Lord Justice said: ‘It appears to me that if this action could be
sustained it would be a very serious matter indeed for every ratepayer in England
in any district in which there is any local authority upon whom duties are cast for
the benefit of the locality. If this action could be maintained, I do not see why it
could not, in a similar manner, be maintained by every owner of land in that
district who could allege that if there had been a proper system of sewage his
property would have been very much improved.’ And he expressed the opinion
that such a contention was not supported either by principle or authority. It is
to be observed that the Highway Act, which defines the duties of surveyors of
highways, prescribes the mode of proceeding when the duty of repairing the highway
is unfulfilled and the liability which is then to attach to the surveyor. By
sect. 94 he may be summoned before the justices, and if it appears either upon the
report of a person appointed by them to view, or on their own view, that the highway
is not in a state of thorough and perfect repair, they are to convict the surveyor in a penalty, and to make an order on the surveyor to repair it within a
limited time; and if the repairs are not made within the time so limited the surveyor
is to forfeit and pay to a person to be named and appointed in a second
order a sum of money equal to the cost of repairing the highway. I think it, to
say the least, doubtful whether, apart from the reason to which I am about to
refer, the contention that an action lies against the local board for a breach of
their statutory duty to repair the highways can be maintained.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Stanley <em>v.</em> Atchison R. Co., 88 Kan. 84, <span class='sc'>Mason, J.</span>, says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The evidence tended to show these facts: Stanley kept a number of cattle
in a feed lot one side of which was formed by the right-of-way fence. Employees
of the company who were engaged in its repair removed a part of it, as well as a
part of Stanley’s fence which connected with it, and as a temporary protection
strung two wires across the gap. The protection was insufficient and the cattle
escaped. None of them was injured upon the right of way, but a number strayed
and were not recovered, and others suffered injury, in some cases fatal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant maintains that in any view of the findings the judgment ought
not to be reversed, for the reason that the petition does not state a cause of action,
because the company was under no obligation to maintain the fence, except for the
purpose of avoiding liability for animals killed or injured by its trains, and therefore
cannot be held accountable for any other kind of loss occasioned by the want
of a sufficient fence. The original statute upon the subject does not in terms require
a railroad right of way to be fenced. It makes the company responsible for
animals killed or injured by the operation of its railway irrespective of negligence,
except where the road is enclosed with a lawful fence.... The later statute imposed
a duty on the railroad company to maintain the fence, and it is liable for
any injury of which its neglect of such duty is the proximate cause....</p>

<p class='c007'>The defendant urges that the purpose of the statute referred to is to promote
safety in the running of trains; that in this purpose is found the only warrant for
imposing upon the railroad company the obligation to fence its right of way; and
that therefore the company’s liability must be limited to injuries resulting from
the operation of the road, and the state has no power to make it liable for losses
occasioned by the escape of animals which do not meet with any injury upon the
right of way. Assuming that the right of the legislature to require a railroad company
to fence its tracks is based solely upon the consideration that such fencing
may be deemed necessary to diminish the danger of injury to animals from the
operation of trains, and to persons and property resulting from trains colliding with
animals, it is competent as a means of enforcing such requirement to make the
company liable for losses occasioned to the landowner by the escape of his cattle
through a defective fence, although they pass from the right of way without
injury.”</p>

L. C., says: “I must protest against it being supposed that in order to prove a
case of this character of fraud, and that a certain course of conduct was induced
by it, a person is bound to be able to explain with exact precision what was the
mental process by which he was induced to act. It is a question for the jury. If
a man said he was induced by such and such an inducement held out in the prospectus,
I should not think that conclusive. It must be for the jury to say what
they believed upon the evidence. Looking at the evidence in this case, I should
say if I were a juryman that this was a very fascinating prospectus, and was calculated
to induce any one who believed the statements in it to invest his money in
the concern.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Mathews <em>v.</em> Bliss, 22 Pick. 48, Shaw, C. J., says: “The judge further instructed
the jury, that in order to maintain this action, they must be satisfied that
the defendants had made the false representation, and that the sale was produced
by means of it; that it was not necessary that it should be the sole and only
motive inducing the sale, but it must have been a predominant one. In this particular, the Court are of opinion, that the direction, as it may have been and probably
was understood by the jury, was not strictly correct; though it may have
been so qualified and illustrated as to prevent the jury from being misled by it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The term ‘predominant,’ in its natural and ordinary signification, is understood
to be something greater or superior in power and influence to others, with
which it is connected or compared. So understood, a predominant motive, when
several motives may have operated, is one of greater force and effect, in producing
the given result, than any other motive. But the Court are of opinion, that if the
false and fraudulent representation was a motive at all, inducing to the act, if
it was one of several motives, acting together, and by their combined force producing
the result, it should have been left to the jury so to find it. If the false
suggestion had no influence, if the plaintiff’s agent would have done the same thing
and made the sale if such representation had not been made, then it was not a
motive to the act, and the plaintiff’s agent was not induced to sell by means of it.
On the whole, considering that the ordinary and natural meaning of the term ‘predominant,’
when applied to one among several motives, is such as has been stated,
that the jury may have so understood it, and if they did so understand it, they may
have come to a verdict not warranted by law, upon the evidence before them, the
Court are of opinion, that the verdict ought to be set aside, and a new trial
granted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Adams <em>v.</em> Gillig, 199 N. Y. 314, plaintiff sued in equity for cancellation of a
conveyance procured by falsely representing that defendant intended to build a
dwelling on the land, when his real intention was to build a garage. Chase, J.,
said (pp. 320–322): “A promise as such to be enforceable must be based upon a
consideration, and it must be put in such form as to be available under the rules
relating to contracts and the admission of evidence relating thereto. It may include
a present intention, but as it also relates to the future it can only be enforced
as a promise under the general rules relating to contracts.</p>

<p class='c007'>A mere statement of intention is a different thing. It is not the basis of an
action on contract. It may in good faith be changed without affecting the obligations
of the parties. A statement of intention does not relate to a fact that has a
corporal and physical existence, but to a material and existing fact nevertheless not
amounting to a promise but which as in the case under discussion affects and determines
important transactions. The question here under discussion is not affected
by the rules relating to the admission of testimony. As it was not promissory and
contractual in its nature there is nothing in the rules of evidence to prevent oral
proof of the representations made by the defendant to the plaintiff. In an action
brought expressly upon a fraud, oral evidence of facts to show the fraud is admissible.
(Pomeroy’s Equity Jurisprudence, Sec. 889.)</p>

<p class='c007'>This case stands exactly as it would have stood if the plaintiff and defendant
before the execution and delivery of the deed had entered into a writing by which
the defendant had stated therein his intention as found by the court on the trial
and the plaintiff had stated her acceptance of his offer based upon her belief and
faith in his statement of intention, and it further appeared that the statement was
so made by the defendant for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to sell to him the
lot, and that such statement was so made by him falsely, fraudulently and purposely
for the purpose of bringing about such sale.</p>

<p class='c007'>Intent is of vital importance in very many transactions. In the criminal courts
it is necessary in many cases for jurors to determine as a question of fact the intent
of the person charged with the crime. Frequently the life or liberty of the
prisoner at the bar depends upon the determination of such question of fact. In
civil actions relating to wrongs, the intent of the party charged with the wrong is
frequently of controlling effect upon the conclusion to be reached in the action.
The intent of a person is sometimes difficult to prove, but it is nevertheless a fact
and a material and existing fact that must be ascertained in many cases, and when
ascertained determines the rights of the parties to controversies. The intent of
Gillig was a material existing fact in this case, and the plaintiff’s reliance upon
such fact induced her to enter into a contract that she would not otherwise have
entered into. The effect of such false statement by the defendant of his intention
cannot be cast aside as immaterial simply because it was possible for him in good
faith to have changed his mind or to have sold the property to another who might
have a different purpose relating thereto. As the defendant’s intention was subject
to change in good faith at any time it was of uncertain value. It was, however,
of some value. It was of sufficient value so that the plaintiff was willing to stand
upon it and make the conveyance in reliance upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The use of property in a particular manner changes from time to time and
restrictive covenants of great value at one time may become a source of serious
embarrassment at a later date. The fact that restrictive covenants cannot ordinarily
be drawn to bend to changed conditions has made many purchasers disinclined
to accept conveyances with such covenants. A restrictive covenant in a
deed may be of sufficient importance to justify a refusal by a contractee to accept a
conveyance subject to such conditions. A person in selling property may be quite
willing to execute and deliver a deed thereof without putting restrictive covenants
therein and in reliance upon the good faith of express, unqualified assurances of
the present intention of the prospective purchaser. In such case the intention is
material and the statement of such intention is the statement of an existing fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unless the court affirms this judgment, it must acknowledge that although a
defendant deliberately and intentionally, by false statements, obtained from a
plaintiff his property to his great damage it is wholly incapable of righting the
wrong, notwithstanding the fact that by so doing it does in no way interfere with
the rules that have grown up after years of experience to protect written contracts
from collateral promises and conditions not inserted in the contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are of the opinion that the false statements made by the defendant of his
intention should, under the circumstances of this case, be deemed to be a statement
of a material, existing fact of which the court will lay hold for the purpose of
defeating the wrong that would otherwise be consummated thereby.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Althause, 207 Mass. 32, 47–49, Loring, J., says: “As a
general proposition of law apart from statutes making it a crime to obtain property
by a false pretence, it would seem that a man’s present intention as to a future
act is a fact. Edgington <em>v.</em> Fitzmaurice, 29 Ch. D. 459. Swift <em>v.</em> Rounds, 19 R. I.
527. In the first of these two cases (Edgington <em>v.</em> Fitzmaurice) Bowen, L. J., said,
at p. 483: ‘The state of a man’s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion.’
And Chapman, C. J., in Commonwealth <em>v.</em> Walker, 108 Mass. 309, 312,
said: ‘A man’s intention is a matter of fact, and may be proved as such....’</p>

<p class='c007'>But in the case at bar the presiding judge went beyond any decided case in the
explanation which he gave of the difference between the representation of a person’s
present intention as to a future act and an assurance or promise that the
future act shall be done. For the purpose of illustrating the essential difference
between the two he put as an example of obtaining property by a false pretence a
case which is not obtaining property by a false pretence. In effect he told the jury
that if A buys property intending not to pay for it he obtains that property by a
false pretence. In that case A makes no representation at all. All that he does is
to make a promise, and a promise is not a representation of a fact. It has been
sought to make out that in legal contemplation a promise with an intention not to
perform is a false pretence because a promise to do a thing of necessity implies a
present intention to do it, and therefore whenever you have a promise coupled with
an intent not to perform you have an implied false representation of an intention
to do the act which the defendant promised to do and so a false pretence. And
this finds some apparent support in Swift <em>v.</em> Rounds, 19 R. I. 527. In that case it
was held that where a defendant buys property intending not to pay for it he is
liable in an action of deceit because he impliedly represents that he intends to pay
for it by the act of buying. It may be doubted whether the making of a promise
implies of necessity in all cases a present intention to perform that promise. Upon
that question we do not find it necessary to express an opinion. For however that
may be, the fraud of obtaining property by buying it intending not to pay for it is
not, as matter of construction of the statute creating it, the crime of obtaining
property by a false pretence.... It is evident that the fraud (which by enacting
that statute the Legislature intended to make a crime) was obtaining the property
of another by a false statement of a fact; and it is equally evident that in enacting
it the Legislature did not have in mind the fraud of buying goods not intending to
pay for them. Both are frauds but they are not the same fraud. In our opinion it

<p class='c007'>In Van Epps <em>v.</em> Harrison, 5 Hill, 63, 70–71, Bronson, J., says: “If an affirmation
concerning the cost of the property was of any consequence, I think the defendant
should have taken the trouble to inquire and satisfy himself. But I cannot think
it a matter of any legal importance. It was only another mode of asserting that
the property was of the value of $32,000; and all the books agree that no action
will lie if such an affirmation prove false. It is the folly of the purchaser to trust
to it. Indeed, the representation here amounts to less than a direct affirmation of
value, for it only asserts that the plaintiff and another man agreed that such was
the value. It would lead to great mischief to allow men to annul contracts upon
such a ground. If the defendant could make out that the plaintiff was his agent in
purchasing from Van Rensselaer, then what the plaintiffs said about the price he
paid might be material; but not in any other point of view.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such are my views upon this branch of the case; but my brethren are of opinion
that the false affirmation concerning the price paid for the land furnishes a good
ground of action. There must, therefore, be a new trial upon this point, as well as
the one relating to the condition of the land.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Aaron’s Reefs <em>v.</em> Twiss, [1896] A. C. 273, Lord Halsbury, L. C., said (pp. 283–284):
“I do not think any particular form of words is necessary to convey a false
impression. Supposing a person goes to a bank where the people are foolish enough
to believe his words, and says, ‘I want a mortgage upon my house, and my house
is not completed, but in the course of next week I expect to have it fully completed.’
Suppose there was not a house upon his land at all, and no possibility,
therefore, that it could be fully completed next week, can anybody say that that
was not an affirmative representation that there was a house which was so near to
completion that it only required another week’s work upon it to complete it?
Could anybody defend himself if he was charged upon an indictment for obtaining
money under false pretences, the allegation in the indictment being that he pretended
that there was a house so near completion that it only required a week’s
work upon it, by saying that he never represented that there was a house there at
all? So here, when I look at the language in which this prospectus is couched, and
see that it speaks of a property which requires only the erection of machinery to be
either at once or shortly in a condition to do work so as to obtain all this valuable
metal from the mine, it seems to me that, although it is put in ambidextrous
language, it means as plainly as can be that this is now the condition of the mine,
that such and such additions to it will enable it shortly to produce all those great
results, and that that is a representation of an actually existing fact. I should
quite agree with the proposition that the Lord Chancellor of Ireland and the
Master of the Rolls put forward—if you are looking to the language as only the
language of hope, expectation, and confident belief, that is one thing; but it does
not seem to have been in the minds of the learned judges that you may use language
in such a way as, although in the form of hope and expectation, it may become
a representation as to existing facts; and if so, and if it is brought to your
knowledge that these facts are false, it is a fraud.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Wiser <em>v.</em> Lawler, 189 U. S. 260, Brown, J., said (pp. 264–65): “Attached to
these prospectuses was a map entitled ‘Map of the group of mines belonging to the
Seven Stars Gold Mining Company.’ It is true that there is neither in the prospectuses
nor in the map a distinct assertion that the legal title to the properties
mentioned was vested in the Seven Stars Company; but we think that no one can
read them without inferring and believing that the Seven Stars was the owner of
these properties, and that the net proceeds of their operation would be distributed
in dividends to stockholders. As they were circulated as an inducement to take
stock in the enterprises, we are bound to interpret them by the effect they would
produce upon an ordinary mind. Andrews <em>v.</em> Mockford, (1896) 1 Q. B. D. 372.
They were, however, even more damaging in their omissions than in their statements.
No mention was made of the fact that the title to these properties stood
in the names of Lawler and Wells; no allusion to the Cowland agreement, with
its provisions for forfeiture, nor to the fact that the only interest of the company
was an equitable right to the properties after the sum of $450,000 had been realized
from the profits and paid to defendants. In estimating the probability of subscribers
being misled by these prospectuses we may take into consideration not
only the facts stated, but the facts suppressed. New Brunswick Co. <em>v.</em> Muggeridge,

<p class='c007'>In Peek <em>v.</em> Gurney, L. R. 6 H. L. 377, Lord Cairns said (p. 403): “Mere non-disclosure
of material facts, however morally censurable, however that non-disclosure
might be a ground in a proper proceeding at a proper time for setting aside
an allotment or a purchase of shares, would in my opinion form no ground for an
action in the nature of an action for misrepresentation. There must, in my opinion,
be some active misstatement of fact, or, at all events, such a partial and fragmentary statement of fact, as that the withholding of that which is not stated
makes that which is stated absolutely false.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Compare Mitchell, J., in Newell <em>v.</em> Randall, 32 Minn. 171, 172–73: “It is doubtless
the general rule that a purchaser, when buying on credit, is not bound to disclose
the facts of his financial condition. If he makes no actual misrepresentations,
if he is not asked any questions, and does not give any untrue, evasive, or partial
answers, his mere silence as to his general bad pecuniary condition, or his indebtedness,
will not constitute a fraudulent concealment. 2 Pom. Eq. Jur. §906; Bigelow
on Fraud, 36, 37. But this was not a case of mere passive non-disclosure. The
object of De Laittre’s inquiry clearly was to ascertain Bauman’s financial condition
and ability to pay. Bauman’s statement was in response to that inquiry,
and, when he undertook to answer, he was bound to tell the whole truth, and was
not at liberty to give an evasive or misleading answer, which, although literally
true, was partial, containing only half the truth, and calculated to convey a false
impression. The natural construction which would, under the circumstances, be
put on this statement is that he had $3,300 capital in his business. It was couched
in language calculated to negative the idea that this was merely the gross amount
of his assets, and that he owed debts to the extent of two-thirds or the whole of that
amount. Such a statement, made under the circumstances it was, might fairly and
reasonably be understood as amounting to a representation that he had that
amount of capital which was and would remain available, out of which to collect
any debt which he might contract with plaintiff. We think this is the way in
which men would ordinarily have understood it. It is immaterial that more
explicit inquiries by plaintiff would have disclosed the fact of his indebtedness. It
does not lie in Bauman’s mouth to say that plaintiff relied too implicitly on this
general statement. To tell half a truth only is to conceal the other half. Concealment
of this kind, under the circumstances, amounts to a false representation.”</p>

favoring this view usually took the form of extending the scope of the action
for deceit. There was a tendency to recognize the existence of what was sometimes
called ‘legal fraud,’ i. e., that the making of an incorrect statement of fact without
reasonable grounds, or of one which was inconsistent with information which the
person had received or had the means of obtaining, entailed the same legal consequences
as making it fraudulently. Such a doctrine would make a man liable for
forgetfulness or mistake or even for honestly interpreting the facts known to him
or drawing conclusions from them in a way which the Court did not think to be
legally warranted. The high-water mark of these decisions is to be found in the
judgment pronounced by the Court of Appeal in the case of Peek <em>v.</em> Derry, (1887)
37 Ch. D. 541; (1889) 14 App. Cas. 337, when they laid down that where a defendant
has made a misstatement of fact and the Court is of opinion that he had no
reasonable grounds for believing that it was true he may be made liable in an
action of deceit if it has materially tended to induce the plaintiff to do an act by
which he has incurred damage. But on appeal to your Lordships’ House this
decision was unanimously reversed, and it was definitely laid down that, in order
to establish a cause of action sounding in damages for misrepresentation, the statement
must be fraudulent or, what is equivalent thereto, must be made recklessly,
not caring whether it be true or not. The opinions pronounced in your Lordships’
House in that case show that both in substance and in form the decision was, and
was intended to be, a reaffirmation of the old common law doctrine that actual
fraud was essential to an action for deceit, and it finally settled the law that an
innocent misrepresentation gives no right of action sounding in damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the Common Law side of the Court the attempts to make a person liable
for an innocent misrepresentation have usually taken the form of attempts to
extend the doctrine of warranty beyond its just limits and to find that a warranty
existed in cases where there was nothing more than an innocent misrepresentation.
The present case is, in my opinion, an instance of this. But in respect of the question
of the existence of a warranty the Courts have had the advantage of an
admirable enunciation of the true principle of law which was made in very early
days by Holt, C. J., with respect to the contract of sale. He says: ‘An affirmation
at the time of the sale is a warranty, provided it appear on evidence to be so intended.’
So far as decisions are concerned, this has, on the whole, been consistently
followed in the Courts of Common Law. But from time to time there have
been dicta inconsistent with it which have, unfortunately, found their way into
text-books and have given rise to confusion and uncertainty in this branch of the
law. For example, one often sees quoted the dictum of Bayley, J., in Cave <em>v.</em>
Coleman, 3 Man. &amp; Ry. 2, where, in respect of a representation made verbally
during the sale of a horse, he says that ‘being made in the course of a dealing, and
before the bargain was complete, it amounted to a warranty’—a proposition
that is far too sweeping and cannot be supported. A still more serious deviation
from the correct principle is to be found in a passage in the judgment of the Court
of Appeal in DeLassalle <em>v.</em> Guildford, [1901] 2 K. B. 215, at p. 221, which was cited
to us in the argument in the present case. In discussing the question whether a
representation amounts to a warranty or not the judgment says: ‘In determining
whether it was so intended, a decisive test is whether the vendor assumes to assert
a fact of which the buyer is ignorant, or merely states an opinion or judgment
upon a matter of which the vendor has no special knowledge, and on which the
buyer may be expected also to have an opinion and to exercise his judgment.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“With all deference to the authority of the Court that decided that case, the
proposition which it thus formulates cannot be supported. It is clear that the
Court did not intend to depart from the law laid down by Holt, C. J., and cited
above, for in the same judgment that dictum is referred to and accepted as a correct
statement of the law. It is, therefore, evident that the use of the phrase
‘decisive test’ cannot be defended. Otherwise it would be the duty of a judge to
direct a jury that if a vendor states a fact of which the buyer is ignorant, they
must, as a matter of law, find the existence of a warranty, whether or not the
totality of the evidence shows that the parties intended the affirmation to form
part of the contract; and this would be inconsistent with the law as laid down by
Holt, C. J. It may well be that the features thus referred to in the judgment of the
Court of Appeal in that case may be criteria of value in guiding a jury in coming to
a decision whether or not a warranty was intended; but they cannot be said to
furnish decisive tests, because it cannot be said as a matter of law that the presence
or absence of those features is conclusive of the intention of the parties. The
intention of the parties can only be deduced from the totality of the evidence, and
no secondary principles of such a kind can be universally true.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is, my Lords, of the greatest importance, in my opinion, that this House
should maintain in its full integrity the principle that a person is not liable in
damages for an innocent misrepresentation, no matter in what way or under what
form the attack is made. In the present case the statement was made in answer to
an inquiry for information. There is nothing which can by any possibility be taken
as evidence of an intention on the part of either or both of the parties that there
should be a contractual liability in respect of the accuracy of the statement. It is
a representation as to a specific thing and nothing more. The judge, therefore,
ought not to have left the question of warranty to the jury, and if, as a matter of
prudence, he did so in order to obtain their opinion in case of appeal he ought then
to have entered judgment for the defendants notwithstanding the verdict.”</p>

admissions of a party operate against him in the nature of an estoppel, wherever,
in good conscience and honest dealing, he ought not to be permitted to gainsay
them. Thus, negligence becomes constructive fraud,—although, strictly speaking,
the actual intention to mislead or deceive may be wanting, and the party may
be innocent, if innocence and gross negligence may be deemed compatible; and in
such cases the maxim is justly applied to him, that where one of two innocent persons
must suffer, he shall suffer who by his own acts occasioned the confidence and
loss. The application of the maxim to the case before us is obvious. The principle
involved in it is kindred to that of an equitable estoppel, the difference being that
the application of the estoppel, instead of the maxim, avoids the loss to the innocent
party who has been misled by the conduct of another. See 1 Story’s Eq. Jur.,

has been that followed in the rulings given, in which, as in many of the older decisions,
it is said that an intent to deceive is a necessary element. But under this
formula the jury were not prohibited from finding the intention and the estoppel,
if, without more, the plaintiff spoke or acted falsely, knowing or having cause to
believe that his words or conduct reasonably might influence the defendant’s
action. The more modern statement, that one is responsible for the word or act
which he knows, or ought to know, will be acted upon by another, includes the
older statement that the estoppel comes from an intention to mislead. White <em>v.</em>

<p class='c007'>In Brownlie <em>v.</em> Campbell, 5 App. Cas. 925, Lord Blackburn said (pp. 952—53):
“The Courts of Law had to refer fraud, in which knowledge was an essential
ingredient, to a jury. A Court of Equity had to find it for itself, and consequently
the judges in Courts of Equity were not driven to be so precisely accurate in stating
exactly whether they were going upon the ground that there was a contract or
warranty that the thing was so, or whether they were going upon the ground that
the party, knowing it was not, and representing that it was, had committed a fraud
in doing that. Most of the cases (the leading one is Burrowes <em>v.</em> Loch, 10 Ves.
470, and it is sufficient to mention that, though there were others) when looked at,
if they do not absolutely amount to contract, come uncommonly near it. In Burrowes
<em>v.</em> Loch a man proposing to lend money on the security of an equitable
assignment of a share of what remained due on account of the residue of a testator’s
estate, went to the trustee who held the fund and asked him, telling him the facts,
‘I am going to lend money upon the security of this share, has any prior loan upon
this been communicated to you so as to make you have prior notice, so as to make
that other loan come in before me and cut me out, tell me that, in order that I may
know whether I will lend the money or not.’ The party on the other side answered,
‘There has been none such.’ To say that that is not warranty or contract that he
has received no such notice is, I think, going very near the wind; if it was not
that it was so uncommonly like it, that I cannot make the distinction myself.
That would have been sufficient for the Master of the Rolls to say, ‘You have warranted
this.’ He also had considerable ground for doubting whether the man had
really <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> forgotten. The man, he seems to have thought, had thought this,
‘I will not take the trouble of a search,’ the fact being that he really knew nothing
about this and would not take the trouble of looking, but he boldly made the assertion,
‘I know there is none,’ saying as a fact, ‘I know there is none,’ when the
real truth could not be more than ‘I am pretty sure there is none.’ If, when a man
thinks it is highly probable that a thing exists, he chooses to say he knows the
thing exists, that is really asserting what is false—it is positive fraud. That has
been repeatedly laid down, and I think the more it is considered the more clear
it becomes. If you choose to say, and say without inquiry, ‘I warrant that,’ that
is a contract. If you say, ‘I know it,’ and if you say that in order to save the
trouble of inquiring, that is a false representation—you are saying what is false to
induce them to act upon it. I think all the cases which have been cited come round
to pointing to that, but none of them, as far as I am aware, are in contradiction
with that which I have cited from Chief Justice Tindal, and I think there are a
good many other authorities to the same effect.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Eastin <em>v.</em> Stockton Bank, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, the court said: “The English cases which
deny the right to maintain the action, stand upon the ground that the successful
defendant is adequately compensated for the damages he sustains by the costs
allowed him by the statute. Those costs, it seems, include the attorney’s charges
for preparing the case for trial in all its parts, the fees of the witnesses and the
court officials, and even the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">honorarium</span></i> of the barrister who conducted the case in
court. The reason upon which the English rule rests would not, therefore, seem
to apply here, where the costs recoverable under the statute are confined to much
narrower limits....</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two other objections made to the maintenance of the action,—first, the
claim that if such suits are allowed, litigation will become interminable, because
every successful action will be followed by another, alleging malice in the prosecution
of the former; and second, that if the defendant may sue for damages sustained
by an unfounded prosecution, the plaintiff may equally bring an action
when the defendant makes a groundless defence,—are well answered in the article
already alluded to [Mr. Lawson’s note, 21 A. L. Reg. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 281, 353]: ‘To the first
objection, it is enough to say that the action will never lie for an unsuccessful
prosecution, unless begun and carried on with malice and without probable cause.
With the burden of this difficult proof upon him, the litigant will need a very
clear case before he will be willing to begin a suit of this character. The second
argument fails to distinguish between the position of the parties, plaintiff and
defendant, in an action at law. The plaintiff sets the law in motion; if he does so
groundlessly and maliciously he is the cause of the defendant’s damage. But the
defendant stands only on his legal rights—the plaintiff having taken his case to
court, the defendant has the privilege of calling upon him to prove it to the
satisfaction of the judge or jury, and he is guilty of no wrong in exercising this
privilege.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Doane <em>v.</em> Hescock, 155 N. Y. Supp. 210, the court (Appellate Term, First Department)
says: “It clearly appears that the complaint does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action for abuse of process, nor are the allegations
sufficient to support an action for malicious prosecution of a civil action in this
state. There is no allegation that the action resulted in damages to the business or
reputation of the defendant or that in any way his personal or property rights were
interfered with. The sole allegation as to damage is the trouble, inconvenience,
and expense of defending the action. This is not sufficient. Paul <em>v.</em> Fargo, 84 App.

<p class='c007'>As to the distinction between malicious prosecution and abuse of process, see
Waters <em>v.</em> Winn, 142 Ga. 138; Wright <em>v.</em> Harris, 160 N. C. 542; Cooper <em>v.</em> Southern
R. Co., 165 N. C. 578.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Wood <em>v.</em> Graves, 144 Mass. 365, Allen, J., said, p. 366: “There is no doubt
that an action lies for the malicious abuse of lawful process, civil or criminal. It is
to be assumed, in such a case, that the process was lawfully issued for a just cause,
and is valid in form, and that the arrest or other proceeding upon the process was
justifiable and proper in its inception. Perhaps the most frequent form of such
abuse is by working upon the fears of the person under arrest for the purpose of
extorting money or other property, or of compelling him to sign some paper, to
give up some claim, or to do some other act, in accordance with the wishes of
those who have control of the prosecution. The leading case upon this subject is
Grainger <em>v.</em> Hill, 4 Bing. N. C. 212, where the owner of a vessel was arrested on
civil process, and the officer, acting under the directions of the plaintiffs in the
suit, used the process to compel the defendant therein to give up his ship’s register,
to which they had no right. He was held entitled to recover damages, not for
maliciously putting the process in force, but for maliciously abusing it, to effect an
object not within its proper scope.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Mayer <em>v.</em> Walter, 64 Pa. St. 283, Sharswood, J., said: “There is a distinction
between a malicious use and a malicious abuse of legal process. An abuse is where
the party employs it for some unlawful object, not the purpose which it is intended
by the law to effect; in other words, a perversion of it. Thus, if a man is arrested,
or his goods seized in order to extort money from him, even though it be to pay a
just claim other than that in suit, or to compel him to give up possession of a deed
or other thing of value, not the legal object of the process, it is settled that in an
action for such malicious abuse it is not necessary to prove that the action in which
the process issued has been determined, or to aver that it was sued out without reasonable
or probable cause: Grainger <em>v.</em> Hill, 4 Bing. N. C. 212. It is evident that
when such a wrong has been perpetrated, it is entirely immaterial whether the proceeding
itself was baseless or otherwise. We know that the law is good, but only if
a man use it lawfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the other hand, legal process, civil or criminal, may be maliciously used so
as to give rise to a cause of action where no object is contemplated to be gained by
it other than its proper effect and execution. As every man has a legal power to
prosecute his claims in a court of law and justice, no matter by what motives of
malice he may be actuated in doing so, it is necessary in this class of cases to aver
and prove that he has acted not only maliciously, but without reasonable or probable
cause. It is clearly settled also, that the proceeding must be determined
finally before any action lies for the injury; because, as it is said in Arundell <em>v.</em>
Tregono, Yelv. 117, the plaintiff will clear himself too soon, viz., before the fact
tried, which will be inconvenient; besides, the two determinations might be contrary
and inconsistent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To proceed unfairly and oppressively but without seeking to compel another to
do what he is not obliged to do, e. g., to enter up judgment on a note after 10 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>
and to bring immediate execution, is not a ground of action according to Docter <em>v.</em>
Riedel, 96 Wis. 158. But see dissenting opinion of Marshall, J.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r435'>435</a>. “When our ancestors years ago drew the distinction between libel and slander,
they exercised that kind of wise discretion which they always exercised over the
whole field of the common law. It would to my mind be very dangerous for us
nowadays to relax in any way the rule of law which confines actions for spoken
words, in the absence of proof of special damage, to a very limited number of
cases.” Vaughan Williams, L. J., in Dauncey <em>v.</em> Holloway, [1901] 2 K. B. 441,

<p class='c007'>The distinction sanctioned in the principal case between oral and written
scandal still obtains in England and the United States. The definition of a libel as
a written publication calculated to bring another into hatred, ridicule, or contempt,
is also universally recognized in English-speaking countries. As it is a pure question
of fact for the jury whether the publication in a given case comes within this
definition, it has not seemed advisable to bring together in this book the multitudinous
instances which have been passed upon. A full collection of the cases
may be found in Odgers, Libel and Slander, (5 ed.) 18–38; Townshend, Slander

<p class='c007'><a href='#r436'>436</a>. There is great diversity of opinion as to what words, imputing the commission
of a crime, are actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. The authorities may be classified as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>I. Words imputing a criminal offence punishable corporally.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Hawes’s Case, March, 113 (speaking against common prayer); Heake <em>v.</em>
Moulton, Yelv. 90; Walden <em>v.</em> Mitchell, 2 Ventr. 265; Scoble <em>v.</em> Lee, 2 Show. 32

439 (“he snaked his mother out of doors by the hair of her head; it was the day
before she died”), the words uttered were held not to give a right of action, since
they imputed crimes punishable only by fine, or by imprisonment merely as a
consequence of the non-payment of the fine.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. Words imputing a criminal offence and involving moral turpitude. Sipp <em>v.</em>
Coleman, 179 Fed. 997; Taylor <em>v.</em> Gumpert, 96 Ark. 354; Frisbie <em>v.</em> Fowler, 2

corporally. Redway <em>v.</em> Gray, 31 Vt. 292 (qualifying Billings <em>v.</em> Wing, 7 Vt.

<p class='c007'>“We cannot accept the absolute and unqualified privilege laid down in Munster
<em>v.</em> Lamb.... We cannot agree with Brett, M. R., that in a suit against counsel
for slander the only inquiry is whether the words were spoken in a judicial proceeding,
and if so, the case must be stopped. We quite agree however, with Bramwell,
J. A., in Seaman <em>v.</em> Netherclift, that ‘relevant’ and ‘pertinent’ are not the
best words that could be used. These words have in a measure a technical meaning,
and we all know the difficulty in determining in some cases what is relevant or
pertinent. With Lord Chancellor Cairns we prefer the words ‘having reference’
or ‘made with reference,’ or in the language of Shaw, C. J., ‘having relation to the
cause or subject-matter.’ And if counsel in the trial of a cause maliciously slanders
a party, or witness or any other person in regard to a matter that has no reference
or relation to, or connection with, the case before the Court, he is and ought to be
answerable in an action by the party injured. This qualification of his privilege in
no manner impairs the freedom of discussion so necessary to the proper administration
of the law, nor does it subject counsel to actions for slander except in cases in
which upon reason and sound public policy he ought to be held answerable. We
cannot agree that for the abuse of his privilege he is amenable only to the authority
of the Court. Mere punishment by the Court is no recompense to one who has
thus been maliciously and wantonly slandered.” Robinson, J., in Maulsby <em>v.</em>

<p class='c007'>In Dawkins <em>v.</em> Lord Rokeby, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, Lord Penzance said: “It is said that a
statement of fact of a libellous nature which is palpably untrue—known to be untrue
by him who made it, and dictated by malice—ought to be the subject of a
civil remedy, though made in the course of a purely military inquiry. This mode
of stating the question assumes the untruth and assumes the malice. If by any
process of demonstration, free from the defects of human judgment, the untruth
and malice could be set above and beyond all question or doubt, there might be
ground for contending that the law of the land should give damages to the injured
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But this is not the state of things under which this question of law has to be
determined. Whether the statements were, in fact, untrue, and whether they were
dictated by malice, are, and always will be, open questions, upon which opinions
may differ, and which can only be resolved by the exercise of human judgment.
And the real question is, whether it is proper on grounds of public policy to remit
such questions to the judgment of a jury. The reasons against doing so are simple
and obvious. A witness may be utterly free from malice, and may yet in the eyes
of a jury be open to that imputation; or, again, the witness may be cleared by the
jury of the imputation, and may yet have to encounter the expenses and distress
of a harassing litigation. With such possibilities hanging over his head, a witness
cannot be expected to speak with that free and open mind which the administration
of justice demands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These considerations have long since led to the legal doctrine that a witness in
the courts of law is free from any action; and I fail to perceive any reason why the
same considerations should not be applied to an inquiry such as the present, and
with the same result.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r461'>461</a>. “White <em>v.</em> Carroll, rightly understood, is in harmony with the other cases.
The case shows that the court held that the answer given to the question put to the
defendant as a witness before the surrogate was not material and pertinent to the
inquiry; and further held it was privileged if the defendant, when he gave it, in
good faith believed that it was; and whether he so believed, was a question of fact
to be determined by the jury. Had the evidence proved that the answer was material
and pertinent, the court must have held it privileged, irrespective of the
defendant’s belief upon the subject.” Grover, J., in Marsh <em>v.</em> Ellsworth, 50 N. Y.
309, 313.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It seems to be settled by the English authorities that judges, counsel, parties,
and witnesses are absolutely exempted from liability to an action for defamatory
words published in the course of judicial proceedings; and that the same doctrine is
generally held in the American courts, with the qualification, as to parties, counsel,
and witnesses, that their statements made in the course of an action must be pertinent
and material to the case.” Lord, J., in McLaughlin <em>v.</em> Cowley, 127 Mass. 316,
319.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The examination of witnesses is regulated by the tribunal before which they
testify, and if witnesses answer pertinently questions asked them by counsel which
are not excluded by the tribunal, or answer pertinently questions asked them by
the tribunal, they ought to be absolutely protected. It is not the duty of a witness
to decide for himself whether the questions asked him under the direction of the
tribunal are relevant. As the witness is sworn to tell the whole truth relating to the
matter concerning which his testimony is taken, he ought also to be absolutely protected
in testifying to any matter which is relevant to the inquiry, or which he reasonably
believes to be relevant to it. But a witness ought not to be permitted with
impunity to volunteer defamatory statements which are irrelevant to the matter of
inquiry, and which he does not believe to be relevant. This statement of the law
we think, is supported by the decisions in this Commonwealth. The English
decisions, perhaps, go somewhat further than this in favor of a witness; certainly
they apply the rule liberally for his protection.” Field, J., in Wright <em>v.</em> Lothrop,
149 Mass. 385, 389.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Their Lordships regret to find that there appeared on the one side of this case
the time-worn fallacy that some kind of privilege attaches to the profession of the
Press as distinguished from the members of the public. The freedom of the journalist
is an ordinary part of the freedom of the subject, and to whatever lengths
the subject in general may go so also may the journalist, but, apart from statute
law, his privilege is no other and no higher. The responsibilities which attach to
his power in the dissemination of printed matter may, and in the case of a conscientious
journalist do, make him more careful; but the range of his assertions, his
criticisms, or his comments is as wide as, and no wider than, that of any other
subject. No privilege attaches to his position.” Lord Shaw in Arnold <em>v.</em> King-Emperor,

<p class='c007'><a href='#r495'>495</a>. In Christopher <em>v.</em> Akin, 214 Mass. 332, the plaintiff was a journeyman painter
in the employ of the defendant, and was at work on the house of one Tillinghast.
Tillinghast complained to the defendant that some of his men had stolen a putty
knife and other property belonging to him. The defendant recompensed Tillinghast
for the property and testified that he was told by one of his men that the
plaintiff had admitted to him that he took the putty knife. The men were paid off
by the defendant at his shop on Saturday night,—their time being made up to
Wednesday. Their pay was handed to them in envelopes. When a man was discharged
his envelope contained his pay up to Saturday night. The plaintiff’s
envelope contained his pay in full, less what the defendant had paid Tillinghast for
the property, with a bill for it. There were four or five men in the shop waiting to
be paid off when it came the plaintiff’s turn to be paid. The plaintiff opened his
envelope and counted the money and found the bill. The plaintiff asked the defendant
what that meant, and the defendant said in response, “Do you want to
know in front of all these men?” and he said “Yes,” whereupon the defendant
said, “That is the stuff you stole from the Tillinghast job.” Morton, J., said:
“Whether a communication is or is not privileged does not depend so much on the
manner or form in which crime is imputed, where the alleged slander consists as
here of a charge of crime, as on the occasion and circumstances under which the
charge is made. If made in good faith in reference to a matter in which the person
making it is immediately interested, and for the purpose of protecting his interest
and in the belief that it is true and without any malicious motive, the communication
is what is termed privileged; that is, the occasion and the circumstances
under which it is made are held to be such as, if nothing more appears, to excuse or
justify the statements that are made.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The defendant was, in my opinion, entitled to have the jury’s decision, as to
the plea of fair comment, whether or not, in all the circumstances proved, the libel
went beyond a fair comment on the plaintiff and on the system of medical enterprise
with which he associated himself, as a matter of public interest treated by the
defendant honestly and without malice. The plea of fair comment does not arise
if the plea of justification is made good, nor can it arise unless there is an imputation
on a plaintiff. It is precisely where the criticism would otherwise be actionable
as a libel that the defence of fair comment comes in. But the learned judge
put aside that defence, and told the jury that unless a justification was proved they
were bound to find a verdict for the plaintiff, and that, unless justified, the libel is
not fair comment and cannot come within the region of fair comment.” Lord

the plaintiff which the plaintiff denies, and which either involve a slanderous
imputation in themselves, or upon which the comment bases imputations or inferences injurious to the plaintiff, it is, I think, settled law that the defence of fair
comment fails, unless the comment is truthful in regard to its allegation or assumption
of such facts.” See also the remarks of Buckley, L. J., in the same case,
p. 253.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Hubbard <em>v.</em> Allyn, 200 Mass. 167, Rugg, J., said (p. 170): “The right of the
defendant was not to make false statements of fact because the subject matter was
of public interest, but only to criticise, discuss and comment upon the real acts of
the plaintiff and the consequences likely to follow from them, or upon any other
aspect of the case in a reasonable way. This may be done with severity. Ridicule,
sarcasm and invective may be employed. But the basis must be a fact, and not a
falsehood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If proof of a malevolent motive would rebut the privilege, which we do not decide,
nothing less than that would do, so far as malice is concerned. It is true, as is
said in the very careful brief for the plaintiff, that in most connections malice
means only knowledge of facts sufficient to show that the contemplated act is very
likely to have injurious consequences. Apart from statute it generally means no
more when the question is what is sufficient <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> to charge a defendant.
Burt <em>v.</em> Advertiser Newspaper Co., 154 Mass. 238, 245. But sometimes the defence
is not that the damage was not to be foreseen, but rests on what in substance
is a privilege, whether of a kind usually pleaded as such or not, that is to say, on a
right to inflict the damage even knowingly. In such cases, if malice in any sense
makes a difference, as distinguished from excess over what was reasonable or needful
to do or say under the circumstances, which often is included under the same
word, Gott <em>v.</em> Pulsifer, 122 Mass. 235, 239, it means that the defendant is not
within the privilege because he was not acting in <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona fide</span></i> answer to the needs of
the occasion, but outside of it from a wish to do harm. See Wren <em>v.</em> Weild, L. R.

<p class='c007'>In Burt <em>v.</em> Advertiser Co., 154 Mass. 238, Holmes, J., said: “But there is an important
distinction to be noticed between the so-called privilege of fair criticism
upon matters of public interest, and the privilege existing in the case, for instance,
of answers to inquiries about the character of a servant. In the latter case, a <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">bona
fide</span></i> statement not in excess of the occasion is privileged, although it turns out to be
false. In the former, what is privileged, if that is the proper term, is criticism, not
statement, and however it might be if a person merely quoted or referred to a statement
as made by others, and gave it no new sanction, if he takes upon himself in
his own person to allege facts otherwise libellous, he will not be privileged if those
facts are not true. The reason for the distinction lies in the different nature and
degree of the exigency and of the damage in the two cases. In these, as in many
other instances, the law has to draw a line between conflicting interests, both
intrinsically meritorious. When private inquiries are made about a private person,
a servant, for example, it is often impossible to answer them properly without
stating facts, and those who settled the law thought it more important to preserve a
reasonable freedom in giving necessary information than to insure people against
occasional unintended injustice, confined as it generally is to one or two persons.
But what the interest of private citizens in public matters requires is freedom of
discussion rather than of statement. Moreover, the statements about such matters
which come before the courts are generally public statements, where the harm done
by a falsehood is much greater than in the other case. If one private citizen wrote
to another that a high official had taken a bribe, no one would think good faith a
sufficient answer to an action. He stands no better, certainly, when he publishes
his writing to the world through a newspaper, and the newspaper itself stands no
better than the writer. Sheckell <em>v.</em> Jackson, 10 Cush. 25, 26.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r551'>551</a>. “It is contended that the amount of the plaintiff’s loss is so entirely a matter
of pure chance as to be incapable of assessment. I cannot for this purpose draw
any distinction between a chance and a probability. In the Oxford English Dictionary
one of the definitions of ‘chance’ is ‘a possibility or probability of anything
happening, as distinct from a certainty,’ and a citation is given from Reid’s
Intellectual Powers, ‘The doctrine of chances is a branch of mathematics little
more than an hundred years old.’ The two words ‘chance’ and ‘probability’
may be treated as being practically interchangeable, though it may be that the
one is somewhat less definite than the other.... It is obvious, of course, that
the chance or probability may in a given case be so slender that a jury could not
properly give more than nominal damages, say one shilling; if they had done so in
the present case, it would have been entirely a question for them, and this Court
could not have interfered. But in the present competition we find chance upon
chance, two of which the plaintiff had succeeded in passing. From being one of
six thousand she had become a member of a class of fifty, and, as I understand it,
was first in her particular division by the votes of readers of the paper; out of
those fifty there were to be selected twelve prize-winners; it is obvious that her
chances were then far greater and more easily assessable than when she was only
one of the original six thousand. If the plaintiff had never been selected at all,
the case would have been very different; but that was not the case. In my opinion
the existence of a contingency, which is dependent on the volition of a third person,
is not enough to justify us in saying that the damages are incapable of assessment.”

<p class='c007'><a href='#r564'>564</a>. “The rule which governs the numerous cases upon this subject is, that where
the proximate effect of the criminal connection is an incapacity to labor, by reason
of which the master loses the services of his servant, such loss of service is deemed
to be the immediate effect of the connection, and entitles the master to his action.
The same principle which gives a master an action where the connection causes
pregnancy or sexual disease applies to all cases where the proximate consequence
of the criminal act is a loss of health resulting in a loss of service. There may be
cases in which the seduction, without producing pregnancy or sexual disease,
causes bodily injury, impairing the health of the servant, and resulting in a loss of
services to her master. So the criminal connection may be accomplished under
such circumstances, as, for instance, of violence or fraud, that its proximate effect
is mental distress or disease, impairing her health and destroying her capacity to
labor. In either of these cases the master may maintain an action, because the loss
of services is immediately caused by the connection, as much as in cases of pregnancy
or sexual disease. Vanhorn <em>v.</em> Freeman, 1 Halst. 322. But if the loss of
health is caused by mental suffering, which is not the consequence of the seduction,
but is produced by subsequent intervening causes, such as abandonment by the
seducer, shame resulting from exposure, or other similar causes, the loss of services
is too remote a consequence of the criminal act, and the action cannot be
maintained. Boyle <em>v.</em> Brandon, 13 M. &amp; W. 738; Knight <em>v.</em> Wilcox, 14 N. Y. 413.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the case at bar, as the ruling appears to have been general that the action
could not be maintained unless pregnancy or sexual disease was proved, we think
a new trial should be granted.” Morton, J., in Abrahams <em>v.</em> Kidney, 104 Mass.
222. See to the same effect Blagge <em>v.</em> Ilsley, 127 Mass. 191; Clark <em>v.</em> Clark, 63 N. J.

<p class='c007'><a href='#r567'>567</a>. Whether it is an excess of fair competition to induce a servant at will to leave
the plaintiff, and enter the service of the defendant, cannot be said to be definitely
settled. In Salter <em>v.</em> Howard, 43 Ga. 601, the plaintiff prevailed; but in Campbell
<em>v.</em> Cooper, 34 N. H. 49, the defendant was successful. The other cases commonly
cited for the plaintiff are distinguishable. In Sykes <em>v.</em> Dixon, 9 A. &amp; E. 693, and
Peters <em>v.</em> Lord, 18 Conn. 337, the servant had left the plaintiff of his own head before
entering the service of the defendant. In Keane <em>v.</em> Boycott, 2 H. Bl. 512, the
defendant, a recruiting officer, officiously induced the servant to leave the plaintiff,
in order to enlist as a soldier. In Speight <em>v.</em> Oliviera, 2 Stark. 493; Morgan <em>v.</em>
Molony, 7 Ir. L. R. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 101, 240; Ball <em>v.</em> Bruce, 21 Ill. 161; and Noice <em>v.</em> Brown,
39 N. J. Law, 569, as in the principal case, the enticement was for an immoral
purpose. In Cox <em>v.</em> Muncey, 6 C. B. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 375, a father induced an apprentice at
will to leave the master, but the motive of the father does not appear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“[Keane <em>v.</em> Boycott, 2 H. Bl. 512] seems contrary to the general principle and
is certainly opposed to the decision of the Court of Appeals in DeFrancesco <em>v.</em> Barnum,
45 Ch. D. 430. The defendant there had enticed away an apprentice of the
plaintiff. But the indenture contained unreasonable stipulations, and it was held
that it might be avoided by the apprentice, and that it was not unlawful for the
defendant to persuade the apprentice to do that which was lawful. It is different,
however, if malice, force or fraud be used to take or decoy the servant away. In
that case the master has a right of action, even though the servant be under no
binding obligation. Per <em>Willes</em>, J., Evans <em>v.</em> Walton, L. R. 2 Com. PL., pp. 621–622.”

<p class='c007'>To induce a servant who is under contract with the plaintiff to leave the latter
at the expiration of the term of service, and to enter the defendant’s service, is no
more than lawful competition. Nichol <em>v.</em> Martyn, 2 Esp. 732; Boston Manufactory

would have completed his contract, and so earned these lands for the Portage
Company. If such a defence were tolerated, it would always be an answer in
case of any wrongful interference with the performance of a contract, for there is
always that lack of certainty. It is enough that there should be, as there was here,
a reasonable assurance, considering all the surroundings, that the contract would
be performed in the manner and within the time stipulated, and so performed as to
secure the land to the company.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It certainly does not lie in the mouth of a wrong-doer, in the face of such probabilities

<p class='c007'>We are concerned here only to point out how the adoption of one or the other of
the above conflicting views may affect the materiality of the landowner’s motive in
the use of percolating water.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the first theory is adopted, then, in some jurisdictions, the landowner would
not be held liable, even though actuated by bad motive (Mayor of Bradford <em>v.</em>
Pickles, [1895] A. C. 587); and, in all other jurisdictions, he would be liable only
when, and because, he was actuated by bad motive.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if the second theory is adopted, the landowner might frequently be held
liable, irrespective of motive. On the second theory percolating water might be
regarded as, in a certain sense, the common property of the adjoining owners (bearing some analogy to an underground lake); and it would be held that each owner
is entitled to only a reasonable share, and is entitled to use that share only for
certain purposes. See 3 Farnham, Waters, § 935. Upon this view an owner who
uses more than his share, or who uses it for purposes outside those legally allowable,
would be liable entirely irrespective of motive. “Later American cases,”
says Professor Huffcut, “transfer the emphasis from the showing of ‘malice’ to
a showing of ‘unreasonable user,’ which may or may not be accompanied by
malice.” 13 Yale Law Journal, 222.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may add that if bad motive should not be held, in itself, a substantive
ground of liability, yet the existence of bad motive might be a piece of evidence
bearing upon the question of reasonable user. User for the sole purpose of gratifying
ill will might not be deemed reasonable.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the general question of liability for malevolent acts in reference to percolating
water, see, Ames, How Far an Act May Be a Tort Because of the Wrongful
Motive of the Actor, 18 Harvard Law Rev. 411, 414–415; Huffcut, Percolating

<p class='c007'>1.—The following paragraph shall be added as a new paragraph after the first
paragraph of section three of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act,
1875:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“An act done in pursuance of an agreement or combination by two or more
persons shall, if done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, not be
actionable unless the act, if done without any such agreement or combination,
would be actionable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>2.—(1) It shall be lawful for one or more persons, acting on their own behalf
or on behalf of a trade union or of an individual employer or firm in contemplation
or furtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at or near a house or place where
a person resides or works or carries on business or happens to be, if they so attend
merely for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or
of peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from working.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) Section seven of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, is
hereby repealed from “attending at or near” to the end of the section.</p>

<p class='c007'>3.—An act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute
shall not be actionable on the ground only that it induces some other person
to break a contract of employment or that it is an interference with the trade,
business, or employment of some other person, or with the right of some other
person to dispose of his capital or his labor as he wills.</p>

<p class='c007'>4.—(1) An action against a trade union, whether of workmen or masters, or
against any members or officials thereof on behalf of themselves and all other
members of the trade union in respect of any tortious act alleged to have been
committed by or on behalf of the trade union, shall not be entertained by any court.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) Nothing in this section shall affect the liability of the trustees of a trade
union to be sued in the events provided for by the Trades Union Act, 1871, section
nine, except in respect of any tortious act committed by or on behalf of the
union in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute.</p>

<p class='c007'>5.—(1) This Act may be cited as the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, and the Trade
Union Acts, 1871 and 1876, and this Act may be cited together as the Trade Union
Acts, 1871 to 1906.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) In this Act the expression “trade union” has the same meaning as in the
Trade Union Acts, 1871 and 1876, and shall include any combination as therein
defined, notwithstanding that such combination may be the branch of a trade
union.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) In this Act and in the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, the
expression “trade dispute” means any dispute between employers and workmen,
or between workmen and workmen, which is connected with the employment or
non-employment, or the terms of the employment, or with the conditions of labor,
of any person, and the expression “workmen” means all persons employed in
trade or industry, whether or not in the employment of the employer with whom a
trade dispute arises; and, in section three of the last-mentioned Act, the words
“between employers and workmen” shall be repealed.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r609'>609</a>. “The defendant associations had the absolute right to threaten to do that
which they had the right to do.” Parker, C. J., in National Protective Association
<em>v.</em> Cumming, 170 New York, 315, p. 329.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will be said that a man has the absolute right to threaten to do that which
he has a right to do. Granted that what you may absolutely do you may absolutely
threaten to do (give unqualified notice of your intention to do). But it does
not follow that you may conditionally threaten to do it. The right to absolutely
refuse to work and the right to conditionally refuse do not, as against third persons,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, persons other than the employer, stand to each other in the relation of the
greater to the less. The former does not necessarily include the latter. They are
distinct from each other; and the latter may sometimes be the more important
and the more dangerous right of the two.” 20 Harvard Law Rev., p. 273.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The right to quit an employment which is terminable at will may include a
right to give absolute and unqualified notice of intention to leave.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It may also include, <em>as against an employer</em>, a right to annex any possible condition
to an offer to work or to a threat to refrain from working. By ‘right as
against an employer’ we mean that an employer could not maintain an action
against a laborer for annexing such conditions. The employer is not legally damaged
by such an offer. He is not bound to accept it. As between B and C, the
person with whom B is directly dealing, it may be true that ‘the right to refuse to
deal involves the right to name any terms which one pleases, and to refuse to deal
except on these terms.’ C cannot maintain an action against B for insisting on
unreasonable terms. But the terms or conditions annexed to an offer may relate
to the offeree’s relations to a third person, and [if the offeree accepts and performs
the conditions] that may raise a question whether such third person has any ground
of complaint.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We think that the right to work or not to work does not include, <em>as against
third persons</em>, the right to annex any possible condition to an offer to work or to a
notice of intention to refrain from work. Suppose that B offers to work for C on
condition that C commits a battery on A. Could B effectively deny that he instigated
the commission of the battery? Could B escape liability to A on the ground
that he was merely stating to C the conditions on which he was willing to exercise
his right to labor or not to labor?” 20 Harvard Law Rev. 270–271.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contrary view is open to several objections:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. It assumes that, if certain conduct of B does not violate any legal right of
C, it cannot infringe a legal right of A.</p>

<p class='c007'>“2. It overlooks the distinction between unconditionally exercising a right, and
offering to exercise it (or to refrain from exercising it) on condition that the offeree
shall take action which is intended to produce (and does produce) damage to a
third person.</p>

<p class='c007'>“3. It assumes that one who intentionally instigates a second person to inflict
damage on a third person can escape responsibility by putting the instigation in
the form of a conditional offer to exercise, or to refrain from exercising, a right
which he had against the second person.” 20 Harvard Law Rev. 269.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f610'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r610'>610</a>. “In many of the cases the element of combination or conspiracy is found. If
the act be lawful, the combination or conspiracy to commit it does not make the
act unlawful; if it be unlawful, the combination to commit it may render its commission
easier and may aggravate the injury; but it does not change the character
of the act. The fact of combination is treated by the courts as of great evidentiary
value in deciding the question of coercion or duress.” Burke, J., in Sumwalt Ice

<p class='c007'>In Bohn Mfg. Co. <em>v.</em> Hollis, 54 Minn. 223, “a large number of retail lumber
dealers formed a voluntary association, by which they mutually agreed that they
would not deal with any manufacturer or wholesale dealer who should sell lumber
directly to consumers not dealers, at any point where a member of the association
was carrying on a retail yard; and they provided in their by-laws that, whenever
any wholesale dealer or manufacturer made any such sale, the secretary should
notify all the members of the fact. The plaintiff, a wholesaler, having made such
a sale directly to a consumer, the secretary threatened to send notice of the fact,
as provided in the by-laws, to all the members of the association.” (This statement
is copied from 17 Green Bag, 218. See also statement by Professor Lewis,
44 Am. L. Reg. <span class='fss'>N. S.</span> 469.) The court refused to grant an injunction against sending
out the notice. Here the retail dealers did not threaten to cease dealing with
any one except their competitors, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, wholesale dealers who should attempt to
sell directly to consumers. They used no lever but their own conduct. They did
not threaten to induce outsiders to refrain from working for, or selling goods to,
the wholesalers. And even as to their own conduct, they did not threaten to abstain
from dealings with wholesalers in all matters, but only in the purchase of
lumber. Much less did they threaten to abstain from dealing with persons who
dealt with the wholesalers. In a subsequent case the same court said: “It is to
be noted that the defendants in the Bohn case had similar legitimate interests to
protect which were menaced by the practice of wholesale dealers in selling lumber
to contractors and consumers; and that the defendants’ efforts to induce parties
not to deal with offending wholesale dealers were limited to the members of the
association having similar interests to conserve, and that there was no agreement
or combination or attempt to induce other persons not members of the association
to withhold their patronage from such wholesale dealers.” Ertz <em>v.</em>  Produce Exchange
